[["faa issues fire warning for lithium batteries says crashed ups plane carried themissuing a warning on the fire dangers of transporting lithium batteries federal aviation officials acknowledged for the first time friday that a ups plane that crashed in dubai last month was carrying a large quantity of them the federal aviation administration warned that lithium batteries can ignite in flight if carried in cargo compartments that become too hot if a fire spreads to lithium batteries they can explode and spread the fire much more rapidly creating a risk of a catastrophic event the faa said in a safety alert to aircraft operators the u s department of transportation is in the process of issuing rules aimed at safer transport of lithium batteries but the faa said it was issuing the alert in the interim because recent tests highlighted their risk the tests by faa technicians between april and september found that exploding lithium batteries blew sealed lids off two types of steel containers used to ship them the explosive force in this test was likely high enough to cause damage to an aircraft s cargo compartment the alert said it also said there are no approved and tested contained that can restrain so called lithium metal batteries the more dangerous of two types of lithium batteries once they ignite the faa did not say what caused the fire that led the ups plane to crash sept killing both pilots including capt doug lampe of prospect ky the investigation of the crash is being led by the aviation authority of the united arab emirates with assistance from u s agencies the uae authority has not released its findings but the faa said it was disclosing that the plane s cargo did include large quantities of lithium batteries because it was prudent to advise operators of that fact since the early there have been dozens of incidents of lithium batteries igniting in flight or in airports according to faa records but it has not been known exactly what triggered many of the fires faa now says its recent tests showed exposure to heat can create a chain reaction leading to self heating and release of a battery s stored energy of the alert offered air carriers advice on how to reduce the risk of fire including requesting customers to identify the presence of lithium batteries in their shipments the faa said its recommendations are limited to batteries transported in cargo holds not those carried on board by passengers for example in electronic equipment such as cameras laptop computers and cell phones faa regulations prohibit shipping bulk quantities of lithium metal batteries in the cargo holds of passenger planes because those batteries cannot be extinguished by halon the faa approved fire suppressant however that rule does not apply to cargo only aircraft such as those flown by ups whose main air hub is in louisville lithium metal batteries are generally non rechargeable rechargeable lithium ion batteries used to power laptops and cell phones are less dangerous because halon will extinguish them however the faa said its test showed that lithium ion battery cells are flammable and capable of self ignition when a battery short circuits is overcharged or is overheated the resulting chain reaction can reach temperatures above degrees fahrenheit the faa said which can ignite paper cardboard and other materials

october s percent slide in industrial output from the previous month was better than expected beating expectations of a percent fall according to a dow jones newswires poll and easing double dip recession fears industrial output might have reached a bottom in october said mitsubishi ufj securities senior economist tatsushi shikano adding that automobile production survived the worst period the october fall was mainly due to decreases in production and shipments the trade ministry said with lower automobile and electronic device production the main contributors the fall coincided with the expiration of a popular subsidy to encourage motorists to buy eco friendly cars a measure that had boosted demand in the wake of the crippling effects of the financial crisis a government survey showed expectations for production to rise percent in november and percent in december it s more important that the government expects positive readings in the next two consecutive months said taro

layoffsbyline by jim abrams associated press writertime tue aug pm et washington summoned back from summer break the house on tuesday pushed through an emergency billion jobs bill that democrats said would save teachers police and others from election year layoffs president barack obama immediately signed it into law lawmakers streamed back to washington for a one day session as democrats declared a need to act before children return to classrooms minus teachers laid off because of budgetary crises in states that have been hard hit by the recession republicans saw it differently calling the bill a giveaway to teachers unions and an example of wasteful washington spending that voters will punish the democrats for in this fall s elections the legislation was approved mainly along party lines by a vote of the aid for the states is to be paid for mostly by closing a tax loophole used by multinational corporations and by reducing food stamp benefits for the poor obama joined by teachers at a rose garden ceremony earlier in the day said we can t stand by and do nothing while pink slips are given to the men and women who educate our children or keep our communities safe the senate narrowly passed the measure last thursday after the house had begun its august break the legislation provides billion to school districts to rehire laid off teachers or to ensure that more teachers won t be let go before the new school year begins the education department estimates that could save jobs education secretary arne duncan said his department would streamline the application process to get the money to local school districts quickly he said three fourths of the nation s districts have said they would be opening the school year with fewer teachers and we wanted to avert a crisis for this year an additional billion would extend for six months increased medicaid payments to the states that would free money for states to meet other budget priorities including keeping more than police officers and other public workers on the payroll some three fifths of states have already factored in the federal money in drawing up their budgets for the current fiscal year the national governors association in a letter to congressional leaders said the states estimated budget shortfall for the period is billion and the extended medicaid payments are the best way to help states bridge the gap between their worst fiscal year and the beginning of recovery not all governors were on board mississippi republican haley barbour said his state would have to rewrite its budget and would have to spend million to million to get its additional million in education grants the billion package is small compared to previous efforts to right the flailing economy through federal spending but with the election approaching the political stakes were high teachers nurses and cops should not be used as pawns in a cynical political game resulting from the democratic majority s failure to govern responsibly said rep david dreier r calif where do the bailouts end asked republican leader john boehner of ohio are we going to bail out states next year and the year after that too at some point we ve got to say enough is enough but democratic rep jay inslee said his state of washington would get funds to keep teachers republicans he said think those billions of dollars for those corporate loopholes is simply more important than almost teachers and classrooms in the state of washington rep jim mcdermott d wash said republicans ignore the fact that the law would not add to the federal deficit they want to do everything in their power to make certain that president obama can t get this country going again i think in november they are going to find it was a dumb policy the means of paying for the bill a result of difficult negotiations in the senate were contentious republicans objected to raising some billion by raising taxes on some u s based multinational companies advocates for the poor protested a provision to accelerate the phasing out of an increase in food stamp payments implemented in last year s economic recovery bill under the measure payments would return to pre stimulus rates in saving almost billion james weill president of the food research and action center said that would be cutting benefits for some million people now receiving food stamps those families will be hungrier and less able to buy healthy diets he said weill s group estimated that a family of four that may now receive about a month in food stamps stood to lose about democrats gave assurances that they would look for other ways to pay for the law before the payment cuts go into effect in four years the cutbacks in food stamps in the bill are plain wrong said house appropriations committee chairman david obey d wis american federation of state county and municipal employees president gerald mcentee rejected gop arguments that the democrats primary purpose with the legislation was to reward their friends in organized labor we re in tough shape out there with these incredible holes in these state budgets to the american people it s tremendously important and

after toyota recalldespite its reputation for quality many toyota owners are worried about the safety of their cars because of a recent recall affecting million cars and trucks with accelerator pedals that can stick in a partially depressed position or return slowly to the idle position while the safety concern is certainly legitimate though toyota says it is very rare it s unlikely that trading in your toyota for another brand makes financial sense even if the big three are offering deals to switch to their models the value of the cars in the recall is dropping right now in fact these recalled cars may not even be taken in trade by certain car dealers at least in the short term since they shouldn t be sold until they are repaired if you are able to trade in your car you ll be getting less than you would have in a trade before the recalls were announced jesse toprak vice president of industry trends at truecar com a web site that follows new car pricing says owners of toyotas that are one to three model years old will lose to in resale value edmunds com s analysis is more dramatic estimating that owners will see a percent drop in the values of their used cars regardless of age this week all three detroit automakers were offering incentives to toyota owners and in some cases owners of other brands to compensate for the diminished value of toyota models while stealing sales from the japanese automaker general motors was the first to offer an incentive to any toyota owner who buys or leases a buick cadillac chevrolet or gmc that incentive is zero percent financing for months cash back on a purchase or three free lease payments for up to ford followed gm offering cash back to anyone trading in a model or newer acura honda lexus toyota or scion for a ford lincoln or mercury vehicle chrysler also jumped in targeting owners of the toyota tacoma tundra and sienna and is offering cash back or lease discounts on any chrysler dodge jeep or ram truck all the incentives run through the end of the month and can be combined with other current incentives so does trading in your toyota for a model from a detroit automaker make financial sense not for most toyota owners if the third party analysis from either edmunds com or truecar com holds true since most will still be losing money on a trade even with the incentives for those owners with older toyotas who were thinking about a new car anyway these additional incentives may be enough to allow them to at least break even on their trade and ease any worries they have about the car s safety however most toyota owners would be letting fear push them into a bad financial decision for those who are concerned about driving contact your nearest toyota dealer and ask for a loaner car until your car can be repaired while toyota isn t officially saying that it will provide any owner with a free loaner in the interim toyota is sending dealers up to to use as a goodwill gesture to its customers dealers can use the money however they see fit including covering the cost of loaner or rental cars providing free maintenance services or adding staff to get repairs done quicker once your car is repaired there should be no issues with selling it however you may want to hold off for a bit the edmunds com analysis concludes that it will take about six months for values to fully rebound that s assuming there are no other issues that cause consumer concern the federal government is investigating the possibility of a defect in the electronic systems of the recalled vehicles that could be causing unintended acceleration it also has launched a new investigation into the toyota prius after receiving reports from consumers of a momentarily loss of braking capability while traveling on uneven road surfaces

outside the north sea will surpass domestic production by and add more than billion to import costs as domestic supplies dwindle and norway increasingly struggles to fill the gap reuters research shows estimates show that britain s own gas supplies will fall from around billion cubic metres bcm per year today to around bcm in if they continue their average annual percent decline since peaking in while demand is set to hold steady between and bcm britain was a net exporter of gas until but a steady decline in output over the last few years has made it more reliant on imports which have so far mostly come from norway and increasingly qatar analysts forecast that norway s exports to the uk will grow at percent a year increasing its supplies from today s bcm to just over bcm by reuters research shows that the ongoing decline in britain s domestic production means that the uk will need to roughly double its imports from alternative gas sources by raising them by percent a year from about bcm now to almost bcm in order to meet its annual gas demand the reuters figures are projections based on current trends that means non norwegian imports will have to surpass domestic natural gas production of around bcm per year by at a cost of more than billion per year based on current market prices for european imports of liquefied natural gas lng or over billion for russian pipeline gas to europe according to reuters research while analysts say that britain has the infrastructure to cope with higher imports they warn that higher imports will have a strong impact on the price the uk pays for gas because the jump in overseas supplies will expose it to price competition around the globe the uk gas price will be driven by the marginal cost of imported supply said david stokes director at energy consultancy timera energy the infrastructure to deal with rising import needs is there so the task is to find gas at the right price said bjorn brochmann director of gas analysis at thomson reuters point carbon although brochmann said that gas prices could also drop in the longer term should a shale oil and gas boom flood global markets with new supplies most analysts say that lng prices as well as pipeline supply prices are set to rise in coming years as demand begins to outpace new supply additions european spot lng cargoes currently cost around per million british thermal units mmbtu compared with per mmbtu in asia and the international energy agency iea says that rising import demand in europe could lift prices closer to per mmbtu later this decade russian pipeline gas currently costs around per thousand cubic metres but rising spot lng or oil markets would also lift its pipeline prices norway can t fill the gap the data also shows that norwegian gas supplies will not be able to meet falling british demand any more by the turn of the decade the only feasible way to replace norwegian and british gas is to begin importing more russian gas through interconnectors with continental europe or to increase lng imports from the middle east africa and perhaps the united states qatar the world s biggest lng exporter already supplies britain with some bcm of gas per year but a moratorium on export expansion until means that its supplies will stagnate and that britain will have to compete with asian and other european utilities for its cargoes but there is also the possibility to step up imports from continental europe which would effectively mean importing russian gas to britain uk shale to the rescue some analysts say that exploration of britain s unconventional shale gas reserves could come to the rescue of dwindling conventional domestic natural gas reserves in the united states a shale gas boom has resulted in a sharp rise in u s natural gas production leading to a collapse in domestic natural gas prices and to the possibility of u s lng exports by in britain shale gas company cuadrilla resources has said its site near blackpool has enough gas to cover uk demand for generations although experts have cast doubt on the claims uk shale gas has the potential to make a useful contribution but it s certainly not going to be possible to exploit enough to offset dwindling north sea supply tim fox head of energy and environment at the institution of mechanical engineers told reuters in poland which geologists initially said had some of europe s biggest shale gas reserves estimates had to be slashed by percent this year after early research had proved too optimistic shale gas production known as fracking is a controversial issue it requires the use of large amounts of water and chemicals and environmental groups as well as large parts of the public oppose using the technology in western europe where population density is much higher than in north america france and bulgaria have banned shale gas exploration and in britain the technology has yet to receive full government approval in the long term and to avoid the public debate fracking causes onshore some geologists also say that fracking could move offshore where vast reserves are seen in the north sea this however would require an oil price of far above per barrel to be a profitable industry so analysts say it will remain a back up option against an oil price shock rather than a viable option of gas supply in the mid term future

that s a major assumption given that mr hammond is a a new chancellor and b has already spoken of a fiscal reset the ifs says tax revenues will be lower that will be partially offset the ifs says by the the government may regain by ending its contributions to the eu budget but again that is a pretty major assumption many government sources i have spoken to believe that in order to smooth the transition to a free trade deal with the eu particularly if there is no agreement on freedom of movement the government may need to maintain some budget payments of course in public finance terms it is not all one way traffic on brexit the bank of england s decision to cut interest rates to reduces the cost of servicing the government s debt too pessimistic the fall in the value of the pound which pushes up import prices also makes britain s trade deficit smaller as it improves export performance and the increase in dollar earnings and profits for global companies based in the uk will also be beneficial for the government s tax receipts these are all rather more marginal than the overall negative effect of the predicted slowdown in the economy some believe those gloomy predictions will prove too pessimistic just as the predictions of a possible recession this year proved to be and if they are all the estimates on the public finances will have to be redone again such is the pain and unpredictability of economic forecasting room for manoeuvre this close to the autumn statement the office for budget responsibility the official economic watchdog will be giving the treasury weekly updates on its predictions for the future of the public finances the obr is likely to downgrade its growth predictions for the uk economy following in the footsteps of the bank of england that means that government receipts will be forecast to be lower the government could respond by cutting spending further unpalatable raising taxes unpalatable or loosening the deficit reduction target likely if economic growth does slow mr hammond s room for manoeuvre to gain back some of those lost goals will be limited\n", ["T2"]], ["noble jets offers affordable european private jet charter

nationwide effort to educate commuters about auto accident dangers dealing with the aftermath of serious car accidents in my practice i am reminded every day that not following basic traffic safety rules can have devastating consequences gottlieb said he represents victims of auto accidents with the law firm of scott c gottlieb associates llp in syracuse gottlieb endorsed the efforts of the annual drive safely work week to encourage safer driving practices the annual event is sponsored by the network of employers for traffic safety and its theme this year is back to basics your keys to safe driving each day of the week emphasizes an important safe driving rule such as seat belt use avoiding drunk and fatigued driving not driving while distracted focusing on safety while parking and reversing and following fundamental safe driving practices gottlieb said he believes that drivers become complacent especially people who have been driving for a long time they stop paying attention and become passive they think an accident can never happen to them the reality is crashes can happen in a split second and if you don t follow basic driving safety tips then your chances of an accident can increase significantly the average american drives between and miles each year and a significant portion of this travel involves commuting to and from work or other work related driving reaching these drivers and reminding them about traffic safety can help reduce traffic accidents during the busiest commuting times gottlieb said americans need to be conscious and aware of how they are driving every time they get into a car gottlieb said only percent of all accidents occur more than miles from home with more than half occurring within five miles this means it is crucial to practice safe driving habits every time you get behind the wheel even if it is a short trip to work or running errands around town even the safest drivers can still fall victim to other motorists recklessness according to gottlieb in my experience most car accidents happen because someone was not doing what they were supposed to when a driver ignores the principles of safe driving and engages in dangerous behaviors like driving while distracted or impaired serious accidents can result he said if another driver injures you through negligent driving a syracuse car accident lawyer can assist you in recovering compensation for injuries car accident lawsuits serve as an important deterrent against dangerous driving because drivers know their insurance rates will go up and their assets may be at risk gottlieb said car accident lawsuits also help to ensure that innocent victims are not left uncompensated for financial and non economic losses following a crash of course no amount of money can ever make up for the pain of an injury or for the loss of a loved one in a car crash that is why programs like drive safely work week are so important if even one crash can be prevented the

better travel options for customers and more closely align the carriers operations without a formal merger passengers get more nonstop flights between major cities in the u s and europe while competition and the weak global economy will likely mean fares won t be affected too much the airlines aren t merging and no subsidiary will be created but airline consultant darryl jenkins said the equal sharing of revenue and costs regardless of who is flying the plane means the carriers will essentially act as one airline on certain routes this is a very big deal jenkins said no new routes were announced beyond what the two previous agreements provided for separately klm signed a joint venture agreement with northwest airlines in while air france and delta signed a joint venture agreement in following atlanta based delta s acquisition of northwest in october the carriers decided to work on forming a single joint venture the latest announcement comes at a time when many people s finances are shaky and demand for air travel has weakened in delta s case it said in april that it will institute a fee for most passengers to check a second bag on an international flight the new checked bag fee is for travel beginning july it also has plans to cut international capacity by percent starting in september and delta has said it would ground to mainline aircraft and remove regional jets from service the joint venture will help delta and air france klm weather the current economic situation and protect their product offerings they said the latest agreement means the airlines will equally share cost and revenues on certain flights regardless of what airline owns or flies the aircraft that s different than a simple codesharing agreement where one airline bears all of the cost but another airline might get a share of the revenue for booking a customer on a flight also under the joint venture sales teams don t have a preference of which airline s flight they book a customer on because the revenue and cost equation is the same whether it s operated by delta or air france klm delta spokeswoman betsy talton said that won t apply for all flights but will for those agreed upon as part of the joint venture what it means for customers is seamless booking and more access to frequent flier upgrades and other redemption opportunities according to delta chief executive richard anderson who spoke to reporters at a news conference in paris that was broadcast on the internet for example a customer in san francisco wanting to fly to paris can book a nonstop flight on delta s web site the flight would be operated by air france at the airport the customer would check in with delta skymiles delta s frequent flier program would be earned for the flight the airlines said they will coordinate branding at airports and global advertising an executive committee consisting of the carriers ceos and a management committee comprising representatives from the carriers will work together on strategy talton said the joint venture is expected to create significant synergies through consolidation of commercial efforts and operational functions she could not say how much the airlines expect to save talton said there are no plans to make changes to employee staffing levels as a result of the initiative the joint venture represents approximately percent of total trans atlantic capacity the cooperation agreement between europe s largest airline and the world s largest airline operator will mean the carriers will operate more than daily flights and offer about seats per day the joint venture covers all the airlines flights between north america and europe between amsterdam and india and between north america and tahiti the companies said the joint venture can be canceled with a three year notice after an initial year term alliances between u s and foreign carriers are not new there s a pending bid by american airlines and british airways to cooperate on trans atlantic flights without fear of breaking antitrust laws regulators are looking at the issue american and ba have been thwarted twice before in seeking closer ties but their prospects appear brighter this time because of changes in the airline industry over the past several years american and its partners in an alliance called oneworld argue that they should get antitrust

irs employees to resolve their tax debts the irs expects to process million individual tax returns this year most will qualify for refunds but with the economy shedding more than million jobs since the start of the recession many taxpayers will be unable to make timely payments under an irs initiative started a year ago agents can negotiate new payment plans and postpone asset seizures for delinquent taxpayers who are financially strapped but make a good faith effort to settle their tax debts the new rules will provide even more relief to people who have been laid off or have had their incomes cut shulman cautioned that those seeking help will have to demonstrate their inability to pay those who fail to file tax returns or who simply ignore collection notices will not be eligible for help individual tax returns are due april a lot of people think of the irs and have a little bit of fear of the irs and we want to make sure they know that our doors are open our people are empowered to make decisions and our goal is to resolve your problem shulman said in an interview shulman said new rules for negotiating tax settlements known as offers in compromise better reflect the economic problems many taxpayers face irs agents can only accept settlements for less than the full amount owed if they determine there is little chance the taxpayer will be able to pay under the old rules agents calculated a taxpayer s ability to pay based on past income however many people who were laid off in the past year don t make nearly as much money as they did in previous years under new rules agents will be able to use current income to calculate a taxpayer s ability to pay shulman said if their incomes increase in the near future the irs will rework the settlement it s really part of the ongoing effort of making sure taxpayers out there know that we want to collect the money that s due but if you want to work with us you should give us a call shulman said to qualify for a tax

that way shulman said the irs wants to keep struggling taxpayers in the system rather than having them fall behind on payments and drop out which would put them at risk for bigger penalties including

went before congress tuesday night urging americans to pull together and rebuild the nation s weakened economy and make a major new commitment to health care reform arriving to cheers the new president struck a tone both sober and defiant of the immense perils he has inherited we will recover obama promised the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation what is required now is for this country to pull together confront boldly the challenges we face and take responsibility for our future once more directly addressing the continued banking crisis obama appeared to signal a more forceful response in cases of insolvent institutions demanding government intervention when we learn that a major bank has serious problems we will hold accountable those responsible force the necessary adjustments provide the support to clean up their balance sheets and assure the continuity of a strong viable institution that can serve our people and our economy obama said this plan will require significant resources from the federal government and yes probably more than we ve already set aside the president acknowledged but while the cost of action will be great i can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years but perhaps a decade that would be worse for our deficit worse for business worse for you and worse for the next generation and i refuse to let that happen the speech capped an often frantic start for his administration that has surpassed even the first month of fdr s new deal and for obama it was a chance to step back and spell out the full scope of the challenges facing the nation and connect the dots of his economic plan for moving ahead not since bill clinton s first term has a democratic president arrived to be greeted by his party in control of congress and with obama together with members of his cabinet many of them born in the the evening captured the arrival of a new generation of leaders the new budget thursday will reflect the stark reality of what we ve inherited a trillion dollar deficit a financial crisis and a costly recession obama said but he signaled that major investments in education energy and healthcare were needed if this century will be another american century chief among these is healthcare reform and the new budget will carve out enough space over the next years to sustain a long promised effort that obama said is linked to the economy itself this is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in america every thirty seconds by the end of the year it could cause million americans to lose their homes the president said we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold in his first five weeks the president has already won approval of his billion economic recovery plan and committed hundreds of billions more to try to stabilize a teetering banking industry and forestall home foreclosures after the wall street and auto bailouts begun last year it s as if he walked into a movie already running and then ramped up the pace with his own restless nature hosting white house summits on the budget this week health care next not to mention visits by the nation s governors and afghan and pakistani delegations there is a lot of caffeine around here these days a top adviser told politico with that caffeine has come some confusion and contradictions tuesday was obama s chance to try to make order of the chaos and buck up anxious voters and wall street investors who lack his famous cool and having already begun to assemble his three legged stool he used the speech to go over the blueprints showing how each of the pieces needs the other to stand up straight the first leg the massive stimulus bill is to create jobs but can t succeed without the government loosening credit by bringing more stability to the financial and housing markets the second leg even then new regulations the third leg will be needed to sustain this growth in the future and avoid a repeat of the same errors that brought the economy to this weakened point we have lived through an era where too often short term gains were prized over long term prosperity where we failed to look beyond the next payment the next quarter or the next election obama said regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market well that day of reckoning has arrived and the time to take charge of our future is here obama s strategy rests on forging some sense of shared sacrifice and purpose in the hard times ahead but his speech showed he can t ignore a real populist anger at bankers and wall street not to mention the jealousies among homeowners angered that a careless neighbor may benefit from government intervention in the housing markets it s not about helping banks it s about helping people obama said because when credit is available again that young family can finally buy a new home and then some company will hire workers to build it and then those workers will have money to spend and if they can get a loan too maybe they ll finally buy that car or open their own business investors will return to the market and american families will see their retirement secured once more slowly but surely confidence will return and our economy will recover in some ways obama s path is more complicated than the one that faced franklin d roosevelt who inherited a far more severe crisis years after the crash but one that allowed him to temper expectations with many of the nation s banks already closed fdr declared a bank holiday and moved quickly with a bill written by many bankers that passed the house after minutes of debate and then was approved that night in the senate he next won an economy act authorizing him to cut spending and appease a deficit conscious budget director four days later fdr had moved on to legalizing percent beer the civilian conservation corp was enacted within the first weeks of fdr s tenure but the major legislation so identified with the new deal came months later and after many fireside chats by comparison obama has felt compelled

economic crisis the homeless population of los angeles fell sharply during the past two years a study released on wednesday found confounding expectations that the recession would drive more people into the city s streets and shelters some credit went to better programs to keep people off the streets but experts say the worst economic slump since the great depression may also have played a role as rents declined and created more affordable housing others disputed that notion asserting that recent waves of foreclosures invariably drive more people into homelessness according to the latest census performed every two years by the los angeles homeless services authority an estimated people are living on the streets in cars in abandoned buildings or in shelters and government funded transitional housing facilities on any given night in greater los angeles that count conducted january is down percent from the tally but remains the largest homeless population of any metropolitan area in the united states said michael arnold executive director of the homeless services authority the number and proportion of the homeless who are living on the streets was down too from percent to about two thirds of the total while the number of families with children included in the tally also dropped substantially arnold said the numbers reflect stepped up local efforts to fight homelessness including a million initiative undertaken by los angeles county and a recent expansion of rental vouchers aimed at homeless families still los angeles the second largest u s city and home to a notorious downtown skid row appears to be bucking a national trend while other areas across the country have seen similar declines in their homeless populations since most sizable cities are reporting increases not decreases said nan roman president of the washington based national alliance to end homelessness she called the findings of the los angeles survey a little surprising but agreed with arnold that it was possible for a housing slump to have depressed rental rates leading to an increase in lower cost housing arnold said that even rising unemployment could indirectly help lower homelessness as a declining work force leads to higher vacancy rates which drives down rents and creates more affordable dwellings what we expected was that people would lose their jobs and then they would lose their homes and then they would become homeless and the answer is that it s a lot more complicated than that he said some experts disputed the notion that the real estate crisis could help ease homelessness it s just a premise that we don t find holds water said neil donovan executive director of the national coalition for the homeless the truth is that there s an overall lack of affordable housing in this country he said when you enter into bad economic times the wealthy and medium income people move into housing that is less expensive and they start occupying units that

fri jul pm et a fatal bear attack in a montana campground near yellowstone national park prompted a flurry of concerned phone calls to the park this week but bear attacks are far from the most common danger to park visitors in fact there hasn t been a bear mauling in yellowstone since said yellowstone public affairs officer linda miller motor vehicle accidents may be the most common way people are killed or injured in national parks said gerry gaumer deputy chief of public affairs for the national park service nps people are looking at things other than the road gaumer said they re sightseeing even though the speed limits are lower in the parks these are mostly two lane roads we have lots of traffic accidents every day miller said she estimated that there are about three life flights to transport a person out of the park to a hospital every day during the busy summer months they re mostly because of car accidents and medical problems like heart attacks animal encounters are rare indeed medical problems rival car accidents as a cause of death in the parks in yellowstone of the fatalities that occurred in the park from to were due to either heart attacks or diabetes twenty deaths within yellowstone during those years were due to motorvehicle accidents but the park reported numbers do not include people who transported out of the park after an accident who later died of their injuries once off site miller said although the total number of fatalities that occur every year in the parks is generally low gaumer said suicides are another common cause of deaths they are remote areas no one will stop you gaumer said in particular colorado national monument seems to have had more than their fair share of suicides but the number that have occurred there could be counted on one hand he said one man died by suicide in yellowstone earlier this summer miller said bear attacks on people in the parks are very rare for example nearly million people now annually visit waterton glacier national park in montana and alberta but only bear related fatalities have been reported in the park since glacier opened in how to prevent bear attacks the best way to reduce the risk of a bear attack is to take proper precautions according to the nps black and brown bears can swim climbtrees and run faster than people both can hit top speeds of mph kph or faster although pepper spray may be a useful safety device and has been shown to be effective at deterring grizzly bears more than percent ofthe time it could also give people a false sense of security according to the nps being alert to one s surroundings and making noise to avoid surprising a bear lower your chances of an attack because both black and brown bears tend to investigate human items such as food and garbage it s a good idea to secure all gear people should never approach bears according to the nps and it is only in extremely rare cases that a bear will attack at night or after stalking a person according to the nps this situation is very serious because it means the bear is preying on people for food a person in this situation should act in ways that let the bear know that they are

british airways braced for the second work stoppage in just over a week by thousands of its cabin crew if the wave of airline strikes spreads or continues into the summer it could undermine the

warned that a strike by tap air portugal pilots would hurt the tourist industry badly our tourist sector is coming out of a very deep crisis this strike is not good for it da silva said the underlying cause for the strikes are the financial difficulties faced by the industry and the cost cutting measures airlines have had to resort to in an effort to maintain competitiveness in the late european airlines invested heavily in new aircraft in order to stave off rapidly expanding competitors such as dubai based emirates or etihad from neighboring abu dhabi and to avoid being relegated to the position of second rate aviation powers this was accompanied by a wave of acquisitions or mergers with other european carriers in an attempt to gain market share and squeeze remaining independents out of the market but the economic downturn and accompanying fall in passenger traffic which has cut revenues by percent across the continent has left the carriers scrambling to stave off bankruptcy by cutting costs and slashing services it s an unusual situation and quite bizarre but the industry is in its worst state ever said john strickland director of jls consulting a london based aviation consultancy firm we re seeing legacy carriers really struggling to fight in a competitive environment because consumers want lower prices and the low cost carriers are offering them he said all this

who do not pay attention to traffic or traffic signals while walking to school two thirds of parents polled drive children to school almost half live less than four blocks away and few carpool the

presents bowman power group ltd bowman power with the european frost sullivan new product innovation award for the development of electrical turbogenerators that convert exhaust gases into useful energy in an industry that is challenged by emission and fuel consumption regulations there is constant need for innovative but affordable technologies to tackle toxic emissions and help energy conservation electrical turbogenerators are competently superior to the conventional technologies and products available in the market logo http www newscom com cgi bin prnh fslogo the efficiency of these electrical turbogenerators from bowman power is far higher than that of the mechanical ones from its competitors it however varies according to the load on the engine at its optimum operating condition the electrical turbogenerator offers more than three times the efficiency offered by mechanical turbocompounding mechanical turbocompounding may even absorb power at certain load conditions and generate power at other load conditions unlike bowman power s turbogenerators which electrically enables the turbine wheel of the turbogenerator to run at controlled speeds thus making sure that all engine points generate power rather than absorb power while bowman power s competitors have introduced mechanical turbocompounding that convert the exhaust gas into mechanical energy that is fed back to the crankshaft the exhaust heat recovery system from bowman power is unique in its ability to convert some of the heat energy from exhaust gases into useful electrical energy says frost sullivan research analyst arif basheer running the turbogenerator at controlled speeds which is one of bowman s pending patents optimises the efficiency across a wider range of engine conditions and delivers significantly higher fuel efficiency thereby having an advantage over the mechanical turbogenerators from its competitors depending on the engine application the electrical turbogenerator can deliver an average increase in fuel efficiency across the varied operating conditions of the engine of around per cent which far exceeds the per cent increase in fuel efficiency offered by mechanical turbocompounding considering the increasing cost of fuel such value add from the company ensures customer loyalty and deeper market penetration with emission norms becoming stricter with time oems and

power s electrical turbogenerator is also far higher as it also allows for engine downsizing and maintains engine power with high exhaust gas recirculation egr while the cost of developing a new technology can be high bowman power claims that the investment on turbogenerators is made mainly keeping in mind the increase in efficiency since fuel economy is of top priority in trucks and buses manufacturers of these vehicles are interested in such systems and within a span of two years it is possible to break even the cost invested on the turbogenerator these advantages offered by bowman power s product eliminate the need for a customer to develop and tune the system further thereby saving time and eliminating the need for further investment within a short period of time bowman power has already secured contracts with over five commercial vehicle manufacturers in europe north america and japan the company offers off the shelf products for certain diesel engine types because the technology involved varies for different engines however because of their modular thermodynamic design it is possible to cater for a wide engine displacement from litres to litres with minor adjustments to their current product range \u00e2 it has also been working with several commercial vehicle manufacturers generator manufacturers and packagers in order to offer the best efficiency through its products the tailor made systems for different engines from bowman power give it an edge over its competitors \u00e2 bowman is now embarking on designs for spark ignition generators and alternative energy recovery technologies for smaller displacement commercial vehicle engines essentially a highly efficient motor generator embedded in a turbocharger or e turbo something previously attempted by major tier without all the pieces of the puzzle \u00e2 bowman has all the pieces so it will be interesting to see if they can succeed where others have failed for these achievements that

percentage of blighted properties than any other u s city about a quarter of its housing stock and in these wastelands an estimated homeless find refuge every night they are wretched people suffering from mental illness disability or substance abuse or simply down on their luck working poor they can be found sleeping in schools rundown shotgun style houses warehouses sprawling factories and even

was a man they found in a house who d been drinking antifreeze for four days in an attempt to kill himself now s he s with volunteers of america it s kind of cool an older guy miller says but we haven t found anyone dead which is good decades of poverty the trauma of katrina the economic downturn and the oil spill in the gulf of mexico are a toxic socio economic cocktail that has made the reality of dire homelessness stubbornly vivid here with about homeless new orleans has the nation s highest number per capita according to unity new orleans enjoying three solid years of growth and excited by rebuilding successes was stunned back into its homeless crisis just after christmas on dec eight squatters a collection of train hoppers and travellers died inside an abandoned rail yard warehouse asphyxiated by carbon monoxide fumes and burned when a fire they d built to warm themselves went out of control the homelessness here does seem very third world and that shouldn t be happening in america in said martha j kegel the executive director of unity i am just horrified by the magnitude of the problem in the wake of katrina new orleans became a laboratory for many things urban planning eco friendly building school reforms community driven politics volunteerism adaptation to a world facing global climate change but social workers and homeless advocates say an opportunity was missed to make new orleans a laboratory for ending homelessness in an american city overnight a majority were left homeless by katrina which struck on aug it took congress until the summer of to give the new orleans metro area enough money funneled through a department of housing and urban development voucher program to house of the most vulnerable people living on the streets by then tent cities had sprung up in front of city hall and along canal boulevard the city s main thoroughfare there was a lot of hope at the beginning after katrina that since everyone had left the city that we could prevent the recurrence of homelessness at all as people came back said nan roman the head of the national alliance to end homelessness not enough was done she said not what we had hoped something like a game changer that didn t happen meanwhile rebuilding programs for renters have languished as has the construction of cheaper housing in addition mental health and health care services remain crippled the magnitude of the problem calls for a muscular response but that hasn t really happened kegel said it s a shame that we re still having to do search and rescue for homeless in abandoned buildings five and a half years after the hurricane and the homeless numbers are creeping back up due to the economic downturn and oil spill there are a number of first time homeless people out on the streets now probably the most we ve seen since katrina said stacy horn koch an advocate hired last month by mayor mitch landrieu to tackle homelessness the city gets about million a year from hud to help the homeless and million for homeless programs was made available through economic stimulus funding but some targeted funds are drying up more than of the special hud permanent housing vouchers have been used once they re gone a door will close on housing the most desperate it s harder and harder to get funds for the long term recovery kegel said the unity van pulls up to a boarded up hotel

they find charles arceneaux jr a year old diabetic living in a grand marquis car after katrina his leg got infected and was amputated the only good thing about the cold is that he doesn t have to

last year leaving one in seven americans in poverty the overall poverty rate climbed to percent or million people the census bureau said thursday in its annual report on the economic well being of u s households the report covers president barack obama s first year in office the poverty rate increased from percent or million people in the share of americans without health coverage rose from percent to percent or million people mostly because of the loss of employer provided health insurance during the recession congress passed a health overhaul this year to address the rising numbers of uninsured people but its main provisions will not take effect until in a statement president barack obama called a tough year for working families but said it could have been worse because of the recovery act and many other programs providing tax relief and income support to a majority of working families and especially those most in need millions of americans were kept out of poverty last year obama said the new figures come at a politically sensitive time just weeks before the nov congressional elections when voters restive about high unemployment and the slow pace of economic improvement will decide whether to keep democrats in power in the house and senate or turn to republicans the percent poverty rate which covers all ages was the highest since it was lower than predicted by many demographers who were bracing for a record gain based on last year s skyrocketing unemployment many had predicted a range of percent to percent broken down by state mississippi had the highest share of poor people at percent according to rough calculations by the census bureau it was followed by arizona new mexico arkansas and georgia on the other end of the scale new hampshire had the lowest share at percent analysts said the full blow of lost incomes was cushioned somewhat by increases in social security payments in as well as federal expansions of unemployment insurance which rose substantially under the economic stimulus program with the additional unemployment benefits workers were eligible for extensions that gave them up to weeks of payments after a layoff david johnson the chief of the census bureau s household economics division estimated that expanded unemployment benefits helped keep million people out of poverty last year the poverty level was set at for a family of four based on an official government calculation that includes only cash income before tax deductions it excludes capital gains or accumulated wealth such as home ownership as well as noncash aid such as food stamps another million people would have been counted above the poverty line if food stamps and tax credits were included as income johnson said last year saw the biggest single year increase in americans without health insurance lifting the total number to the highest since the government began tracking the figures in the number of people covered by employment based health plans declined from million to million although those losses were partially offset by gains in government health insurance such as medicaid and medicare diane rowland executive vice president of the kaiser family foundation said additional increases in the uninsured are probable in the short run in under the new health law medicaid will be expanded to pick up millions more low income people and the government will offer tax credits for many middle income households to use to buy coverage through new online insurance markets in each state by the government has estimated that nearly percent of the u s population will have health insurance roughly a percentage point increase from today s level other census findings among the working age population ages to poverty rose from percent

international adoption the last resort juntunen said for many of these children intercountry adoption is the best resort in fact juntunen noted a majority of americans have a favorable opinion of intercountry adoption and believe that adoptive parents are as likely if not more likely to be responsible parents than biological parents juntunen announced he will release the full results of a new survey on international adoption feb the first of its kind in years the survey of respondents conducted by strategies of costa mesa calif indicates that many americans have a higher opinion of intercountry adoption than those espoused by a handful of organizations some estimates indicate haiti had as many as orphans prior to the earthquake now surely there are many thousands more juntunen noted my fear is that many of these children will be left behind neglected by the narrow minded agendas of special interest groups he said when it comes to the best interests of a child there is not a one size fits all solution in many cases the best answer for orphaned children is to remain in haiti if there is a chance they can be re united with parents or immediate extended family said juntunen that is one reason why chances for children has partnered with the haiti renewal fund to assist with the long term rebuilding efforts in haiti especially those geared toward improving the welfare of

township alternate engineer went through the process of the pilot program in cinnaminson where he is also the engineer and recommended that the committee hear the presentation and consider the program mr turik went through a study done by rutgers to pinpoint the most hazardous intersections we evaluated them basically on the t bone type accidents as well as the deaths that occurred he said we chose four intersections and went through the process and believe that the department of transportation dot will approve all of the funding mr callari said ats is a small program right now but is constantly growing currently municipalities in new jersey have selected ats as their vendor for the red light camera systems ats installs a camera at intersections and a sensor that goes in the road lanes to sense when a car is completely stopped the sensors do not interfere with the traffic signals and there are usually two to three sensors placed in one lane two images are captured of the vehicles the first would show a vehicle with all four wheels completely behind the stop line when the light is red the second image is used to capture the vehicle in the middle of the road going through the red light the cameras are all in sealed cases and are temperature controlled mr callari said it s in that case so when it is exposed to the elements it still works the way it is expected too if something goes wrong with a camera we are usually notified long before the dot or police department realizes it and are out there fixing it that day the images are then sent to a web enabled violation processing system which is used by municipalities police departments and courts the system is used for full image review what s very unique about a single camera solution is that all the elements of proof are embedded in the actual image mr callari said there will be a high standard of evidence to confirm that a violation was made after cameras are installed there must be a day warning period to let the public know the cameras are in position no violations are issued during that time ats is operational in states the company is well known for the installation of red light cameras throughout five boroughs in new york city currently no burlington county municipality has cameras from ats installed though cinnaminson is on the waiting list statistically we are now the leading company in the business mr callari said in new jersey we are dominating the market we are the vendor of choice by all the larger municipalities we are well positioned in all of the metropolitan areas across the country mr callari said these cameras have helped with reductions in violations and accidents in new york city committee members asked for statistics for reductions in new jersey but dramatic

accident scenes mr callari said also police violations supercede an ats one it is not a violation until it is approved by your police department mr turik said the major reason for the presentation was for the township to get in line he said the process for cinnaminson to get all of the required approvals took up to six months i wanted to let you know what s out there because if you re interested there is a process and it took us cinnaminson well over six months he said you want to get in line very quick the committee did not take action regarding the presentation because there is no time

allocated and not spent it becomes attractive we need to find ways to make that less attractive said a senior administration official news reports in recent weeks and sources close to treasury

back against those reports thursday stressing that no decisions have been made and that an announcement on the issue is far from imminent geithner did some pushback himself telling members of the

administration highlight the perils of its position on this issue the white house has signaled that it wants to dedicate to deficit reduction and putting the bulk of tarp funds into paying down the

in achieving this goal would mark a significant milestone in the introduction of platooning to fleet operators who expect considerable efficiency and safety gains while maintaining a maximum level of data security a photo accompanying this announcement is available at http www globenewswire com newsroom attachmentng nxp daf trucks tno and ricardo previously achieved a breakthrough truck platooning distance of seconds between trucks while platooning at km per hour trucks that were linked wirelessly via technology along with high performance camera and radar systems were able to maintain a distance of meters flawlessly the consortium is now cooperating to further bring down the minimum distance between trucks by another percent to seconds which equals meters at km h in this new context the platooning system will need to reliably react times faster than a human driver this requires the wireless communication between trucks to take place in the timeframe of milliseconds this breakthrough will be achieved through a variety of technology enhancements that improve safety the integration of a powerful sensor fusion and control system that can create monitor and maintain platooning and driving modes in a functionally safe way even with the occurrence of external hazards or internal malfunctioning system behavior even in the latter situations the convoy will operate fail safe the system will need to operate at a high functional safety level to enable the shorter driving distance safely this will be accomplished by using asil functional safety qualified components from nxp such as microcontrollers microprocessors power management ics and networking components the basis for the system development is the nxp bluebox platform that incorporates most of the aforementioned components enhanced radar will detect road interferences such as cars cutting in faster and more accurately to seamlessly adjust the distance between the trucks for this purpose nxp is

major offshore oil spill forcing a refinery to cut processing and importers to divert cargoes elsewhere the aftermath of the weekend fire could disrupt shipments of oil iron ore and soy and add to pressure for stricter environmental standards in china already reeling from a toxic copper mine leak in the south of the country which burst into headlines last week amid accusations of a cover up the fire began on friday while a crude oil tanker was being off loaded nobody was hurt but hundreds of firefighters battled for more than hours to douse the fire and state media said about tonnes of oil had spilled into the sea causing a sq km sq mile slick sq km of which was severe of the sq km area sq km had been cleaned up and tonnes of oil had been collected by p m gmt on monday the local government said in a statement the clean up operation may take five days it said without giving a timeframe for the port as many as six very large crude carriers vlccs or million barrels of crude oil are set to be diverted shipping sources said possibly to south korea or any one of another half dozen vlcc terminals in china dalian s xingang oil port is home to a million barrel strategic petroleum reserve facility one of china s four state storage bases already in operation as well as commercial storage run by cnpc and petrochina that may be even bigger it is also a transfer spot for two major

closure of the main oil port that receives crude shipments regularly and is also an export hub for gasoline and diesel industry sources are divided on how long the port will stay shut with some estimating between seven and more than days but officials could not give a timeframe petrochina has started trimming refinery operations at one of the plants the bpd wepec by several thousand tonnes per day the port was sealed right after the explosion we have a one week contingency plan but are hoping that the oil spill can be cleaned up as soon as possible an oil executive said the incident drew the attention of top chinese officials including president hu jintao premier wen jiabao and security chief zhou yongkang who all issued statements and instructions during the blaze but port officials did not show up at a news conference on monday morning a city government official said workers are using skimmers and dispersants to break up the oil slick and stop it spreading the official china daily said the pollution is concentrated about km miles offshore by sunday evening about meters of floating booms had been set up and at least oil skimmers were working to clean the spill the newspaper quoted local officials as saying there are no residents within km miles of the affected site and little marine farming the report added market impact eyed while the main oil facilities at the port were not damaged a dalian based shipping agent told reuters that percent of all the berths of dalian port which includes xingang were shut including for iron ore and grain cargoes dalian customs authority has handled about percent of china s soy imports so far this year with million worth arriving in may the last month for which figures are available we aren t sure yet how much of the port is closed or for how long it will be closed but if it isn t just confined to the xingang area then the impact on soybean imports is going to be massive said li qin an analyst capital futures in beijing if the port is closed the volumes are bound to drop imports were actually rising in june and there are a huge number of orders that can t just be canceled or diverted to other ports other soy market participants played down the importance of the accident saying many buyers were well supplied and the port was already congested so a few days more made no odds dalian port whose shares fell percent said the accident had not caused any direct damage to the oil terminal s main facilities the impact being limited to ancillary facilities such as control systems but it was still assessing the effect on its operations analysts played down comparisons with bp plc s spill in the gulf of mexico and said petrochina s parent china national petroleum corp could easily cover the damage costs it s not going to be a major cost in the big scheme of things it s going to be in the tens of millions of dollars not tens of billions of dollars said david johnson at rbs who estimated the cost at million

percent of the amount due once payment is a day late they must also compensate any costs for recovering payments through a bailiff or court action the bill sets no late payment rules for private

samples in north fork a town in the burn zone in east central idaho after the so called mustang complex fire swept through a former uranium mine and two abandoned gold mines health officials said then they believed risks to people s health was low and the latest findings back up that assessment residents in the area had expressed worries about the smoke paul ritter health physicist with the state environmental agency said in the area of the mining sites smoke from the fire showed amounts of radiation roughly equivalent to emissions from a fire in that charred parts of los alamos national laboratory the nuclear weapons design facility in new mexico the readings are definitely elevated but not out of line with what has been measured in fires before it is not a risk he said americans are exposed to an estimated millirems of radiation a year from natural sources including some rocks and soils according to the u s nuclear regulatory commission an analysis of air samples in north fork showed residents would have been exposed to millirems of radiation in a day period that compares to a dose of millirems delivered by a round trip transcontinental flight ritter said residents certainly weren t in a bad state in terms of airborne radioactivity he said the mustang complex fire has consumed nearly acres of canyon lands and pine forests since it was ignited by lightning in late july in the salmon challis national forest even without a danger from radioactivity smoke from the blaze has posed a danger to residents especially the young and the elderly because it carries fine soot particles that can worsen existing respiratory or cardiovascular ailments the smoke triggered unhealthy air readings for more than a month in north fork and salmon in a pollution event that idaho health officials said was unprecedented for its duration and predicted impacts on human health the findings of no significant risk from radiation did not ease concerns about exposure for cindy

while the recession took a toll on manufacturing and other industries one part of the economy has remained a bright spot over the past few years food production across the nation food producers are seeing enough growth that many are expanding and investing in new equipment for cheesemakers dairy farmers and vegetable growers the slow economy has brought opportunities to expand while construction costs are low food makers have also benefited from having products that consumers still buy in hard times and from ongoing efforts to open up new markets overseas the result is growth both in sales and in facilities the expansions include cheese making operations in wisconsin and idaho and a sweet potato canning plant in arkansas hershey co is spending million to expand and update a plant in its namesake town in pennsylvania and general mills inc has been pouring millions into yogurt plants in michigan and tennessee even in tough economic times people are still going to buy groceries said barbara gannon a spokeswoman for wisconsin based sargento foods inc while chrysler general motors and other companies tied to the auto industry have closed factories in wisconsin in recent years sargento is among the food makers expanding there it s adding a multi million dollar building to its headquarters in plymouth sargento is the fifth local cheese company to expand in the past five

sargento began considering expansion a few months ago to keep up with demand that has remained brisk even as the economy stalled the company which is best known for its cheddar swiss and provolone cheeses had about million in sales last year and projects about million in sales this year gannon said other cheese makers and distributors from vern s cheese inc in chilton wis to jerome cheese in

wisconsin cheese makers association people are eating more frozen pizzas he said or adding string cheese to the lunches they re increasingly packing at home even we didn t necessarily see this coming umhoefer said where a recession is a net positive for cheese sales another reason companies are expanding now is that constructions costs have come down edith knoespel who owns vern s cheese with her husband said their business hasn t fully recovered from a dip two years ago but it s come back enough that now is a smart time to grow they expanded their retail store so the space that once held

per yearwashington the financial overhaul law that president barack obama and democrats enacted last year will cost nearly billion to implement this year according to congress chief auditor but little

for other costs carrying out the new statute the gao also estimated that full time federal employees will handle the new law a combination of new and reassigned workers the figures did not say how many would be newly hired the law was enacted last summer in the wake of the recession and financial crisis of the past few years it established a new agency designed to help consumers who have mortgages credit cards and other financial instruments it set up new regulatory bodies and gave new powers to existing agencies to oversee the economy and imposed new restrictions on banks credit rating agencies and other financial companies the gao figures will be used by lawmakers at a wednesday hearing of the house financial services committee s oversight subcommittee that is examining the costs of the law republicans who solidly opposed the legislation have said it goes too far and will stifle companies while democrats have defended it as a needed curb to help ward off future economic meltdowns the near billion increase compares with combined spending by the agencies of nearly billion this year that means the money needed to carry out the new law will account for about percent of those agencies budgets the auditors figures showed that only three of the agencies examined get funds from taxpayer dollars that are directly approved by congress the treasury department the commodities futures trading commission and the federal trade commission the new law s price tag for those three agencies comes to about million according to the gao figures the other agencies budgets come from assessments levied on the companies they regulate or from the federal reserve the central bank s revenues come chiefly from interest on government securities and fees from banks the agency

first time homebuyers potentially applying it to all but the wealthiest homebuyers supporters say doing so would further boost home sales stabilize housing prices and generate jobs opponents say extending and expanding the credit would be a waste of money and only temporarily stave off further price declines the credit now can be claimed by anyone buying a home who has not owned one for three years and who closes the deal by nov beyond extending that deadline some lawmakers want to make the credit available to all homebuyers who meet income eligibility requirements and some want to increase the amount of the credit from to currently the first time home buyer credit is available in full to those buying their primary residence who make or less for joint filers a partial credit is available to those making between and to for joint filers the case for expanding the credit through mid september million tax returns had qualified for the credit according to the irs some portion of those returns which the irs couldn t specify represents buyers who took advantage of an earlier version of the tax credit which was only worth and has to be repaid over time by the end of november the credit will have been used by million homebuyers at least of whom would not have bought a house without the tax break according to estimates by the national association of realtors mark zandi chief economist of moodyseconomy com favors extending the current credit until june and making it available to all home buyers regardless of income or at least to everyone except those at the highest end of the income scale he estimates the cost of doing so wouldn t exceed billion over years zandi s reasoning foreclosures are expected to rise next year because of rising unemployment and that will drag home prices down further extending and expanding the credit will help mute that decline and by june there s a chance the job market will have stabilized the most fundamental argument for the credit is that nothing works in the economy if housing is falling it hurts household wealth and credit becomes tight zandi said the credit is a good insurance policy it s vital to stem the housing price declines to kick start economic activity zandi believes lawmakers should set aside an amount of money for an extended credit and tell potential home buyers first come first served the national association of home builders would like the credit extended for all of we estimate that this would increase home purchases by in the next year and help mitigate the foreclosure crisis by whittling down inventory nahb chairman joe robson said in a statement this stimulus alone would create nearly jobs over the coming year which is exactly what the economy needs right now a study funded by the industry supported fix housing first coalition found that the current credit helped stimulate demand for homes at the lower end of the price spectrum an expansion of the tax credit would spur an increase similar to what occurred in the lower end of the market by motivating buyers in the trade up market to purchase a higher priced primary home said kenneth rosen in testimony before congress rosen runs the consulting group that conducted the study and is chairman of the fisher center for real estate and urban economics at the university of california in berkeley the case for letting the credit expire opponents of extending and expanding the credit worry that such moves offer poor bang for the buck and won t stem housing declines everything spent on this program will ultimately have to be paid for later through higher economically harmful taxes ted gayer co director of economic studies at the brookings institution wrote in a brookings blog assuming there are million home sales in gayer said expanding the credit to all homeowners is poorly targeted because it would give a credit to million homebuyers who would have bought a home anyway the current credit was estimated to cost federal coffers billion over years but gayer notes that the cost is likely to be much higher since more people than expected took advantage of it but only about of people wouldn t have bought a house otherwise another argument against an extension it would only temporarily boost home prices and potentially set up those using it for a fall that s because home prices are likely to decline once the credit expires and interest rates ultimately trek north according to dean baker codirector of the center for economic and policy research temporarily propping up house prices so that a new set of homebuyers can incur losses is a policy of questionable merit baker said in a cepr column the sooner the market adjusts the better baker said he did offer one caveat we may want to step in to prevent prices from overshooting on the downside in a select group of markets where this is a real possibility zandi said that s already happened in a number of markets and that an extended credit might help

just before the concorde took off caused the crash which killed people continental which was fined euros and ordered to pay concorde s operator air france a million euros in damages attacked the verdict as unfair welder john taylor was handed a month suspended prison sentence for having gone against industry norms and used titanium to forge the piece that dropped off the plane continental said it would appeal what it called an absurd verdict taylor s french lawyer said he would also appeal i do not understand how my client could be considered to have sole responsibility for the concorde crash lawyer francois esclatine told french itele television continental which has since been swallowed to form united continental holdings will have to pay percent of any damages payable to families of victims the ruling said airbus parent eads would have to pay the other percent the verdict exposes continental and eads to damages claims that could run to tens of millions of euros if insurance companies seek reimbursement for sums already paid to relatives individual damages in such cases can reach some million in the united states but tend to be lower in france where damages for wrongful death are closer to and economic losses are compensated on a strict scale legal specialists say a continental spokesman said the ruling showed the determination of the french authorities to

between london paris and new york eads lawyer simon ndiaye said the company was still deciding whether to appeal three french aviation officials including the former head of the concorde program henri perrier were acquitted by the court as was taylor s supervisor at continental the trial has led to warnings in the aviation industry that taking crash investigations out of the hands of regulators and

advises the flight safety foundation called the verdict an affront to our outstanding aviation safety records and said it could impede co operation on plane crashes if there is willful misconduct then

days that bp must go ahead with the bottom kill even though the top plug appeared to be holding on tuesday and again on wednesday though he said testing still needs to be done on the well before a final decision is made bp and the federal government will check to see whether the cement pumped in through the top went down into the reservoir came back up and plugged the space between the inner

manufacturing a new twist on airplane wing design n the new wing architecture which could greatly simplify the manufacturing process and reduce fuel consumption by improving the wing s aerodynamics as well as improving its agility is based on a system of tiny lightweight subunits that could be assembled by a team of small specialized robots and ultimately could be used to build the entire airframe the wing would be covered by a skin made of overlapping pieces that might resemble scales or feathers the new concept is described in the journal soft robotics in a paper by neil gershenfeld director of mit s center for bits and atoms cba benjamin jenett a cba graduate student kenneth cheung phd a cba alumnus and nasa research scientist and four others researchers have been trying for many years to achieve a reliable way of deforming wings as a substitute for the conventional separate moving surfaces but all those efforts have had little practical impact gershenfeld says the biggest problem was that most of these attempts relied on deforming the wing through the use of mechanical control structures within the wing but these structures tended to be so heavy that they canceled out any efficiency advantages produced by the smoother aerodynamic surfaces they also added complexity and reliability issues by contrast gershenfeld says we make the whole wing the mechanism it s not something we put into the wing in the team s new approach the whole shape of the wing can be changed and twisted uniformly along its length by activating two small motors that apply a twisting pressure to each wingtip like building with blocks the basic principle behind the new concept is the use of an array of tiny lightweight structural pieces which gershenfeld calls digital materials that can be assembled into a virtually infinite variety of shapes much like assembling a structure from lego blocks the assembly performed by hand for this initial experiment could be done by simple miniature robots that would crawl along or inside the structure as it took shape the team has already developed prototypes of such robots the individual pieces are strong and stiff but the exact choice of the dimensions and materials used for the pieces and the geometry of how they are assembled allow for a precise tuning of the flexibility of the final shape for the initial test structure the goal was to allow the wing to twist in a precise way that would substitute for the motion of separate structural pieces such as the small ailerons at the trailing edges of conventional wings while providing a single smooth aerodynamic surface building up a large and complex structure from an array of small identical building blocks which have an exceptional combination of strength light weight and flexibility greatly simplifies the manufacturing process gershenfeld explains while the construction of light composite wings for today s aircraft requires large specialized equipment for layering and hardening the material the new modular structures could be rapidly manufactured in mass quantities and then assembled robotically in place gershenfeld and his team have been pursuing this approach to building complex structures for years with many potential applications for robotic devices of various kinds for example this method could lead to robotic arms and legs whose shapes could bend continuously along their entire length rather than just having a fixed number of joints this research says cheung presents a general strategy for increasing the performance of highly compliant that is soft robots and mechanisms by replacing conventional flexible materials with new cellular materials that are much lower weight more tunable and can be made to dissipate energy at much lower rates while having equivalent stiffness saving fuel cutting emissions while exploring possible applications of this nascent technology gershenfeld and his team consulted with nasa engineers and others seeking ways to improve the efficiency of aircraft manufacturing and flight they learned that the idea that you could continuously deform a wing shape to do pure lift and roll has been a holy grail in the field for both efficiency and agility he says given the importance of fuel costs in both the economics of the airline industry and that sector s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions even small improvements in fuel efficiency could have a significant impact wind tunnel tests of this structure showed that it at least matches the aerodynamic properties of a conventional wing at about one tenth the weight the skin of the wing also enhances the structure s performance it s made from overlapping strips of flexible material layered somewhat like feathers or fish scales allowing for the pieces to move across each other as the wing flexes while still providing a smooth outer surface the modular structure also provides greater ease of both assembly and disassembly one of this system s big advantages in principle gershenfeld says is that when it s no longer needed the whole structure can be taken apart into its component parts which can then be reassembled into something completely different similarly repairs could be made by simply replacing an area of damaged subunits an inspection robot could just find where the broken part is and replace it and keep the aircraft percent healthy at all times says jenett following up on the successful wind tunnel tests the team is now extending the work to tests of a flyable unpiloted aircraft and initial tests have shown great promise jenett says the first tests were done by a certified test pilot and he found it so responsive that he decided to do some aerobatics some of the first uses of the technology may be to make small robotic aircraft super efficient long range drones gershenfeld says that could be used in developing countries as a way of delivering medicines to remote areas\n", ["T3"]], ["firefighters battle week

students at african centered timbuktu academy of science and technology in detroit on march timbuktu has about students and is one of nine detroit public schools authorized charter schools detroit robert bobb has spent the past two years closing dozens of schools and firing principals in an effort to fix the failing detroit public schools yet he still hasn t solved the problem for which he was hired erasing a legacy budget deficit that now stands at million now in his final months as the state appointed emergency financial manager bobb is proposing several headline grabbing ideas including a radical plan to shut down so many buildings that some high schools could see more than students per class in an attempt to wipe out the red ink the state board of education wants the budget gap closed sooner than later despite reworking vendor contracts to save money shutting down old high maintenance buildings weeding out numerous cases of fraud and theft and keeping dozens of teaching and other district jobs unfilled the deficit hasn t gone away with bobb s contract ending in june he s floating extreme measures to get the job done there are so many competing interests within the detroit public schools you kind of have to throw a lot of different stuff against the wall to see what sticks says michael van beek director of education policy at the mackinac center for public policy a free market think tank in midland mich bobb s latest proposal announced about a week ago calls for placing academically poor schools and the students attending them in the hands of charter operators rather than simply closing schools this plan seeks to transform dps into one of the nation s premier urban school districts by recruiting some of the best proven school operators to serve detroit s children and remake schools that have been failing them for years bobb has said of the charter proposal another model seeks to take revenue and pay off the district s outstanding debt while doing away with the existing school system a new district with new contracts and staffing levels would be built from the ground up existing schools would be moved into the new system bobb also has proposed asking the state to continue current funding levels despite a drop in enrollment while it chips away at the accumulated deficit over time but this seems unlikely as republican gov rick snyder already is planning cuts to per pupil funding in his proposed state budget none are guaranteed to work and most would draw opposition from the teachers union and parents who don t want to see schools closed and teacher contracts thrown out in favor of charter school operators hiring non union educators to work in their buildings but all are preferred to bobb s initial deficit elimination plan that called for closing of detroit s schools and increasing the maximum high school class size to though that plan was approved in february by state education officials who wanted to see a proposal that would eliminate the deficit quickly even bobb says it goes too far he had no choice but to get us down to zero by the fiscal year said district spokesman steve wasko it is not the plan we want nor is it good for dps or its students bobb was appointed by then gov jennifer granholm in march to turnaround the cash strapped district he hired an inspector general to look into complaints of financial wrongdoing and within two months was investigating about cases of theft and fraud audits of school records revealed some administrators made or received inappropriate personal loans along with the school closings contracts of more than principals were not renewed less money also is flowing out of the district as bobb cut millions of dollars in spending from the budget but as enrollment drops less money to pay the bills is coming in and while seeking answers to the district s financial turmoil bobb also is fighting other battles he has a school board that has taken him to court and won a recalcitrant teachers union that promises to file grievances then he has people within detroit neighborhoods who don t want to see schools shuttered van beek said bobb was given more ammunition when snyder recently signed a bill that gives broad new powers and tools to financial managers to restructure school districts and communities headed toward insolvency under the law financial managers will be able to toss union contracts to help balance the books strip power from local elected officials or in extreme cases dissolve a town or school district it s unclear how bobb will use that going forward for now he continues to push the charter school plan which is the one receiving the most support in the city at the moment even from the school board under bobb s proposal detroit schools would sponsor the charters and seek out groups to operate them the district would lease the buildings for an estimated million and receive percent of whatever funding each charter gets from the state operating costs are expected to drop by up to million the district would save about million by not having to secure the closed buildings but the teacher s union has been fighting bobb s efforts to close schools over the past two years and is adamantly opposed to adding more charters in detroit while losing district run buildings detroit federation of teachers president keith johnson says charter schools even those authorized by the district are not required to hire displaced detroit public schools teachers or hire teachers under the union contract the district s track record with charter schools has not been smooth it has closed two since it began authorizing academies in according to wasko the michigan institute for construction trades and technology was closed in for among other things failing to abide by and meet its educational goals and meeting generally accepted public sector accounting principles the new horizon academy was also shut down in for the same reasons bertha marsh who has five grandchildren in detroit schools says while most people don t want change the problems with the schools leave them no choice the district knows it has to do something mr bobb has seen how the finances are doing and he sees it s impossible to make it financially stable unless they do something drastic it can t be the same old same old she said\n", ["T2"]], ["business

that radioactive material in the reactor vessel could leak outside but the amount is expected to be small and the wind blowing towards the sea will be considered chief cabinet secretary yukio edano told a news conference continuing coverage of japan disaster the magnitude earthquake that shook japan early march caused cooling system malfunctions at two nuclear reactors one at the tokyo electric

down automatically when something called ground acceleration is registered at a certain point which is usually quite small it will instantly drop control rods into the nuclear core professor tim

["crescent city is a tsunami magnet expert sayscrescent city since the tidal gauge was installed in the boat basin in this small port on california s rugged northern coast has been hit by tsunamis large and small the latest on friday took one life about miles to the south at the mouth of the klamath river where a young man was on the beach with friends taking pictures the waves also roared into the boat basin here ripping up docks sinking boats and damaging causing untold millions of dollars in damage authorities said crescent city is what i call a tsunami magnet said lori dengler professor of geology and chair of the geology and oceanography departments at humboldt state university when you look at the contiguous states there is no question that crescent city has had more damage and typically has the highest water levels recorded at any west coast site no matter where it comes from whether it comes from chile or alaska or japan she said chris goldfinger professor of marine geology and ocean geophysics at oregon state university agreed crescent city gets hammered time and time again because the basic configuration of the place never changes he said in an e mail the harbor is very small so the waves are trapped inside and bounce around making a chaotic flow inside as more waves arrive and do the same thing adding to the mess other larger harbors tend to absorb the energy one factor that saved the port from even more damage was that the surge hit at low tide keeping it within the confines of the breakwalls around the harbor dengler said a network of deep sea warning sensors alerted the whole west coast hours in advance before the surges from the earthquake off japan hit here on friday morning the town wasn t forewarned on good friday when a huge earthquake in alaska s prince william sound sent a bigger surges down the coast they killed people and wiped out city blocks lee wilson recalls seeing his dad s fishing boat the gold coast tossed on the harbor breakwall like a toy to sit high and dry there was no boat basin then no docks wilson s dad repaired the boat and wilson still fishes it but he had the engine out for an overhaul when this tsunami hit and couldn t take it out to sea tucked in a sheltered corner of the boat basin it rode out the surges and just missed being slammed by the harbor dredge when it broke loose tsunamis are different than storm seas dengler said a storm wave is generated by the wind and is only moving the top of the water column a tsunami is generated by an upheaval on the ocean floor and the force extends from the surface to the ocean floor even if the water is thousands of feet deep this tsunami was generated by one tectonic plate slipping violently underneath the other in a zone miles long and miles wide dengler said the wave raced across the ocean at the speed of a jet airplane to mph crossing the pacific to a ship at sea it was not even noticeable three to four feet high a bump in the ocean as it moved east the energy bounced off a huge underwater ridge extending out from mendocino deflecting part of it toward crescent city the deflection slowed the wave making it a little higher moving into shallower water the energy built even more it was focused again by the half moon shape of the bay the first surges to hit the shore were small bouncing back they made the next surges bigger when the biggest of the surges hit the tidal gauge it measured feet dengler said that bouncing amplification is what caught dustin weber at the mouth of the klamath river he and two friends thought the tsunami was over after the first surge his family said he was caught in a bigger surge that hit a couple hours later his body has not been found the word tsunami is japanese for harbor wave and many times the worst physical damage comes once the waves enter the confines of a harbor said costas synolakis professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the tsunami research center at the university of southern california after the tsunami crescent city built a rectangular boat basin it is great at sheltering boats from stormy seas but actually makes the effects of the tsunami worse dengler said it looks like what happens if you hit a drum synolakis said you create waves with just one hit to it but the drum keeps vibrating what that means is it takes a couple waves to come in then you set up these back and forth waves inside the harbor that end up reinforcing each other crescent city took about hours for the oscillation to die down another set of oscillations is created by the waves bouncing off the continental shelf he said synolakis hopes that if scientists can understanding the oscillations better they can design harbors so the water bounces around less what we are realizing in california is if we have tsunamis coming from far away we are not going to see huge waves of the size we saw in japan he said but we are going to have these very strong currents that essentially destroy the ports misty bob page saw the effects firsthand on friday not wanting to spend the day on the ocean riding out the tsunami he kept his boat misty anne in the boat basin the tsunami roared in one wave after another his boat was torn loose and flung about he and a friend fended off other boats they managed to duck into another slip and tie up

airport is not equipped with sophisticated equipment such as doppler radar which is used in many u s airports to help detect wind shear larry cornman a physicist and expert on wind shear and turbulence at the national center for atmospheric research in boulder colorado said he doubted lightning alone would be enough to bring down an aircraft he said a strike would have to be powerful enough to pierce the aircraft skin and would have to hit a very specific location such going through a wing and into a vapor filled fuel tank planes are designed to be protected from lightning and

pm et washington afp us president barack obama is confident in the quality of gulf of mexico seafood despite the bp oil spill and will serve some at a party sunday to mark his birthday a top aide said later today at the president s birthday party he s going to be serving his guests seafood from the gulf of mexico white house energy advisor carol browner told nbc the white house did not release details about the sunday event obama turned on august while his wife and their daughters were out of town and he marked the occasion in chicago with a collection of friends including talk show queen oprah winfrey the gulf of mexico is known for its shrimp crab oysters and dozens of species of fish but the billion dollar seafood industry has been devastated by the spill due to the closure of large

budget on thursday aiming to avoid the political humiliation of having brussels impose conditions on any request for an international bailout some ministries could see their budgets slashed by up to percent spanish media said as prime minister mariano rajoy s battle to reduce one of the euro zone s biggest deficits is made still harder by falling tax revenues in a recession we know what we have to do and since we know it we re doing it rajoy said on wednesday as street protests in madrid and secession talk by the northeastern catalania region compounded his government s problems we also know this entails a lot of sacrifices distributed evenly throughout spanish society he said while visiting new york to attend the u n general assembly details are to be announced at a news conference starting at around p m gmt following a cabinet meeting thousands of anti austerity demonstrators demanding that rajoy resign gathered for a second night on wednesday near the parliament building which was guarded by hundreds of police protests on wednesday were peaceful after a march on tuesday ended in clashes with police the only way we can achieve anything is to be here every day said demonstrator adelaida olivares who is unemployed rajoy s image has deteriorated rapidly since his party won an absolute parliamentary majority last november newspaper pictures of the conservative premier smoking a cigar on sixth avenue in new york while protesters gathered in madrid fuelled criticism of his detached attitude toward spain s mounting problems rising calls for independence from within catalonia one of spain s wealthiest regions ahead of an early regional election set for november have added to uncertainty over rajoy s ability to make powerful regional barons accept deep

euros billion by weeding out corporate tax breaks including reinvestment incentives and exemptions on foreign earnings and dividends according to juan jose rubio guerrero president of the independent forum of fiscal analysts tax breaks are worth billion euros in spain wage freezes for public employees will also be extended into trade union sources said cuts in department budgets would range from percent at the justice ministry to percent at agriculture while industry minister jose manuel soria said his own ministry would see its budget cut by percent europa press said other media said the public works ministry would reduce spending on infrastructure by nearly a quarter while the culture ministry budget would be cut by a third spain is talking to brussels about the terms of a possible european aid package that would trigger a european central bank bond buying program and ease madrid s unsustainable borrowing costs the reforms to be announced on thursday are meant to pre empt the conditions that would be attached to the aid uncertainty over the timing of an aid request and divisions within the european union over a plan to create a banking union sent the yield on spain s year

costs falling to their lowest level since may at percent compared to percent in late august rome s year yield also fell to percent from percent a month ago spain the euro zone s fourth largest economy is at the centre of the crisis investors fear that madrid cannot control its finances and that rajoy does not have the political will to take all the necessary but unpopular measures ecb data released on thursday showed consumers and companies continued to pull their money out of spanish banks in august though at a slower pace than in july with private sector deposits falling slightly more than percent in the month euro zone economic sentiment fell sharply in september defying expectations as the region sinks in to recession even in the currency bloc s most successful economy germany unemployment crept up for a six successive month in september figures released on tuesday suggested spain will miss its public deficit target of percent of gross domestic product this year and on wednesday the central bank said the economy continued to contract sharply in the third quarter retail figures on thursday showed sales fell for the straight month in august adding to pressure for an economy reeling from paralyzed domestic demand and high unemployment as critics say rajoy s measures lack substance and fail to outline convincingly how they will raise the necessary cash on paper they can make it all add up but it will be hard to make the budget credible given all the reasonable doubts on the deficit target it will be really tough to make the markets buy it said a member of parliament for the ruling party who asked not to be named little room to manoeuvre sweeping tax hikes and spending cuts introduced in july mean the government has little room to manoeuvre after street protests against austerity turned violent on tuesday rajoy may choose to tread carefully and avoid further cuts to the welfare system but with pensions one of the largest spending costs further belt tightening may be unavoidable european diplomats are exerting pressure on madrid to freeze pensions although the rajoy government has been adamant that it would only touch pensions as a last resort the budget which was delayed after the previous socialist government passed the baton in advance of a national election last november was further held up by rajoy until after regional elections in andalusia in march the wait for the andalusia elections sent a very negative signal on what we could expect from the new government they say they ll do whatever needs to be done but that needed to be done and when it wasn t it hit credibility said luis carames economist at the university of santiago de compostela elections in galicia the region where rajoy was born and in the basque country on

declarationssummary we found exaggerations and false claims flying thick and fast during the first debate between president obama and his republican challenger mitt romney obama accused romney of proposing a trillion tax cut not true romney proposes to offset his rate cuts and promises he won t add to the deficit romney again promised to not reduce the taxes paid by high income americans and also to lower taxes on middle income families but didn t say how he could possibly accomplish that without also increasing the deficit obama oversold his health care law claiming that health care premiums have gone up slower than any time in the last years that s true of health care spending but not premiums and the health care law had little to do with the slowdown in overall spending romney claimed a new board established by the affordable care act is going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have not true the board only recommends cost saving measures for medicare and is legally forbidden to ration care or reduce benefits obama said million private sector jobs had been created in the past months perhaps so but that counts jobs that the bureau of labor statistics won t add to the official monthly tallies until next year for now the official tally is a bit over million romney accused obama of doubling the federal deficit not true the annual deficit was already running at trillion when obama took office obama again said he d raise taxes on upper income persons only to the rates that we had when bill clinton was president actually many high income persons would pay more than they did then because of new taxes in obama s health care law romney claimed that middle income americans have seen their income come down by that s too high census figures show the decline in median household income during obama s first three years was even after adjusting for inflation obama again touted his trillion deficit reduction plan which includes trillion from winding down wars that are coming to an end in any event romney sometimes came off as a serial exaggerator he said up to million might lose health insurance under the new law citing a congressional budget office study that actually put the likely number who would lose employer sponsored coverage at between million and million he said million americans are out of work when the actual number of jobless is much lower he claimed half of all college grads this year can t find work when in fact an ap story said half either were jobless or underemployed and he again said obama cut billion from medicare a figure that actually reflects a year target for slowing medicare spending which will continue to grow analysis the debate was held oct inside a huge sports center at the university of denver it was the first of three scheduled debates between president barack obama and his republican challenger mitt romney it was carried live on national tv networks and radio trillion tax cut the president said romney was proposing a trillion tax cut and romney said he wasn t the president is off base here romney says his rate cuts and tax eliminations would be offset and the deficit wouldn t increase obama governor romney s central economic plan calls for a trillion tax cut on top of the extension of the bush tax cuts romney first of all i don t have a trillion tax cut i don t have a tax cut of a scale that you re talking about to be clear romney has proposed cutting personal federal income tax rates across the board by percent in addition to extending the tax cuts enacted early in the bush administration he also proposes to eliminate the estate tax permanently repeal the alternative minimum tax and eliminate taxes on interest capital gains and dividends for taxpayers making under a year in adjusted gross income by themselves those cuts would according to the nonpartisan tax policy center lower federal tax liability by about billion in calendar year compared with current tax policy with bush cuts left in place the obama campaign has extrapolated that figure out over years coming up with a trillion figure over a decade however romney always has said he planned to offset that massive cut with equally massive reductions in tax preferences to broaden the tax base thus losing no revenue and not increasing the deficit so to that extent the president is incorrect romney is not proposing a trillion reduction in taxes the impossible plan however romney continued to struggle to explain how he could possibly offset such a large loss of revenue without shifting the burden away from upper income taxpayers who benefit disproportionately from across the board rate cuts and especially from elimination of the estate tax which falls only on estates exceeding million left by any who die this year the tax policy center concluded earlier this year that it wasn t mathematically possible for a plan such as romney s to cut rates as he promised without either favoring the wealthy or increasing the federal deficit except for saying that his plan would bring in the same amount of money when you account for growth romney offered no new explanation for how he might accomplish all he s promised he just repeated those promises in some of the strongest terms yet romney my number one principal is there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit i will not reduce the taxes paid by high income americans i will lower taxes on middle income families but he didn t say how he d pull off all those things at once six other studies when the president referred to the tax policy center s criticisms romney claimed it was contradicted by several others romney there are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it s completely wrong that s not quite true as we previously reported when the count was at five we found that two of those studies were blog items by romney backers and none was nonpartisan the only one of those studies by someone not advising romney was done by harvey rosen a princeton economics professor who once served as chairman of president george w bush s council of economic advisers rosen concluded that romney could pull off his tax plan without losing revenue assuming an extra percent growth effect to the economy resulting from romney s rate cuts that s an extremely aggressive assumption and in conflict with recent experience despite bush s large tax cuts in and for example real gdp grew by percent or more for only two of his eight years in office the average of the year to year changes was just over percent furthermore bush s cuts reduced the total tax burden on the economy because they were not offset by base broadening measures in theory at least romney s revenue neutral rate cuts would have even less of a stimulative effect than bush s cuts did overselling the health care law obama wrongly said that over the last two years health care premiums have gone up slower than any time in the last years that s true of health care spending not premiums but even if obama had worded the claim correctly he still would have been off in suggesting the affordable care act had caused the slower growth in spending obama and the fact of the matter is that when obamacare is fully implemented we re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down and over the last two years health care premiums have gone up it s true but they ve gone up slower than any time in the last years so we re already beginning to see progress the growth in employer sponsored family premiums has fluctuated in recent years it went up just percent from to according to an annual survey by the kaiser family foundation but it increased percent the year before a big jump from the mere percent increase between and clearly the growth rate over the last two years isn t a year low it was sitting around percent from to however the growth of health care costs is at a year low for the past two years president bill clinton used this statistic correctly in his speech at the democratic national convention also implying that the federal health care law deserved credit but as we said then most of the law hasn t even been implemented yet and experts say it s the sluggish economy that s mainly responsible for the slower rate of spending as the washington post reported experts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services said that many lost employer sponsored insurance when they lost their jobs and other individuals chose to forgo health care services they could not afford the new york times quoted experts saying that consumers and medical professionals behavior could be changing in anticipation of the law but it was still the economy that was the leading factor as for that increase in health care premiums experts told us the federal health care law has had a limited impact on those too but the impact was to increase costs they said the law was responsible for a percent to percent increase last year because of more generous coverage requirements treatment denied romney repeatedly claimed that a new government board was going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have not true it could make some binding recommendations about such things as what drugs or medical devices would be paid for by medicare but it has no legal power to dictate treatment or ration care the board is a member panel that s tasked with finding ways to slow the growth of medicare spending so its work concerns medicare not everyone seeking health care and according to the law the board can t touch treatments or otherwise ration care or restrict benefits what s officially called the independent payment advisory board made up of appointed health care experts medical professionals and consumer representatives would make binding recommendations to reduce the growth of spending congress could override them with a three fifths majority in each house an analysis by the kaiser family foundation determined that the ipab was limited to finding savings from medicare advantage the part d prescription drug program skilled nursing facility home health dialysis ambulance and ambulatory surgical center services and durable medical equipment million jobs obama claimed that over the last months we ve seen million jobs in the private sector created obama s figure is nearly half a million jobs short according to current bureau of labor statistics figures but he s including in his count a preliminary revision of jobs figures that bls will not finalize until next year the current bls numbers are based on monthly surveys of businesses and government entities and count how many workers are on the payroll those figures show that the number of private sector jobs grew by million between february and august of this year but bls often revises those figures each year the agency looks over companies tax records in an effort to get a more accurate number a process that takes several months in late september bls released a preliminary estimate for its revised numbers adding private sector jobs to its count for the time period between april and march bls will release its final numbers in february the addition of the preliminary estimate brings the number of private sectors jobs to more than million obama doubled deficit romney the president said he d cut the deficit in half unfortunately he doubled it trillion dollar deficits for the last four years it s not true that obama doubled the deficit he inherited a trillion deficit and deficits have remained at or above that level as romney said every year since then romney is right however that obama has not kept his promise to cut the deficit in half here s the budget history in brief the fiscal year began oct when george w bush was president and ended sept with obama as president by the time obama took office in january the nonpartisan congressional budget office had already estimated that the federal government would end fiscal with a trillion deficit because of higher spending and lower revenues obama added to the deficit but not by much we found that obama was responsible at most for an additional billion the government ended trillion in the red that year the deficits were about trillion each year for the next two years and this fiscal year just ended with a shortfall of nearly trillion so obama didn t double the deficits but the president did pledge to cut them in half by the end of his first term during his state of the union address on feb a congressional budget office analysis of the president s latest budget plan doesn t show the deficit being cut in half until same rates as under clinton obama repeated a favorite talking point saying that his tax plan would return rates for the wealthy back to where they were during economically prosperous times under president bill clinton but those making over a year would actually pay more than they did under clinton due to new taxes imposed on upper income people to pay for the health care law obama but i have said that for incomes over a year that we should go back to the rates that we had when bill clinton was president when we created million new jobs went from deficit to surplus and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot obama is referring to his plan to allow the bush tax cuts to expire for higher income taxpayers the top federal income tax rate would be allowed to rise from the current percent to percent which was the rate that prevailed after clinton s tax increase and before bush s tax cuts the next highest rate would go back to the clinton era percent starting with family income over or for singles up from the bush rate of percent but obama did not account for the new taxes on those same upper income taxpayers included in his affordable care act starting next year there will be a new percent tax on unearned net investment income such as capital gains from the sale of stocks or real estate dividends interest income annuities rents and royalties also starting jan is a new percent medicare surcharge on top of the current medicare payroll tax both taxes apply to taxable compensation that exceeds for singles or for couples filing jointly those two taxes combined are projected to bring in nearly billion over the next seven years according to the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation income loss as he has done a number of times recently romney inflated the loss of income for middle income americans under obama romney middle income americans have seen their income come down by this is a this is a tax in and of itself i ll call it the economy tax it s been crushing romney didn t clarify whether he was talking about household or family income but either way the number is inflated the latest figures from the census bureau for show that real household income inflation adjusted fell by during obama s first three years in office real family income again inflation adjusted fell by there s also some reason to think the income decline bottomed out a year ago sentier research which romney has in the past cited as his source says in its latest report issued sept that household income rose in the year since september when sentier s seasonally adjusted household income index hit its lowest point see figure page as part of the same riff on the hardships facing middle income americans romney also noted that gasoline prices have doubled under the president that s true but as we have noted before the price of gasoline was unusually low when obama took office due to the recession and financial crisis the average price for regular gasoline was last week according to the u s energy information administration a bit more than double the average the week obama took office but the average exceeded a gallon for seven weeks during the summer of and it has never reached under obama obama s trillion reduction plan obama i ve put forward a specific trillion deficit reduction plan it s on a website you can look at all the numbers what cuts we make and what revenue we raise nonpartisan and bipartisan budget analysts have been critical of the methodology obama employed to get to the trillion in cuts outlined in the president s plan for economic growth and deficit reduction specifically the plan s inclusion of more than trillion in savings over the next years from our drawdowns in afghanistan and iraq was criticized by maya macguineas president of the bipartisan committee for a responsible federal budget as a gimmick drawing down spending on wars that were already set to wind down and that were deficit financed in the first place should not be considered savings macguineas said when you finish college you don t suddenly have thousands of dollars a year to spend elsewhere in fact you have to find a way to pay back your loans and as we have noted even if you accept obama s trillion claim the president s own office of management and budget projected annual federal deficits would never be lower than billion that s higher than any year of the bush administration except for the trillion shortfall for fiscal for which obama himself bears some responsibility and under obama s plan deficits would again rise during the last three years of the year period reaching billion in see table s million lose their insurance romney said the cbo says up to million people will lose their insurance as obamacare goes into effect next year the congressional budget office said that may happen under a very pessimistic scenario but the agency said it is more likely that about million to million fewer people on net would obtain health insurance from their employer under the law the cbo also said that it was possible that more people would be covered by employers not fewer under a more optimistic scenario what s more these individuals wouldn t necessarily lose insurance entirely many would qualify for federal subsidies to buy policies offered through the new state exchanges established by the law or qualify for medicaid million out of work romney overstated the number of unemployed americans when he said that there were million people out of work there were million unemployed americans in august the most recent figures from the bureau of labor statistics romney meant to refer to the unemployed plus those working part time who want full time work million and those who are considered marginally attached to the labor force because they have not looked for work in the past four weeks million all of that adds up to million romney got his talking point closer to the truth when he said we ve got million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country but he still left out the million who are working part time for economic reasons jobless grads romney said that percent of college graduates this year can t find work that s not correct romney is likely referring to an analysis of government data conducted for the associated press that found that in percent of bachelor s degree holders under the age of were unemployed or underemployed that year but it s not correct to say that a person who is underemployed meaning that they have a part time job or a job for which they were overqualified can t find work it s also a figure that applies to last year not this year as romney said romney continued to repeat his misleading claim that obama s affordable care act cut medicare billion for current recipients that s a reduction in the future growth of medicare spending over years not a billion slashing of the current budget billion again romney went on to say i want to take that billion you ve cut and put it back into medicare but the fact is the money isn t being taken away from medicare instead medicare would spend it but over a longer period of time than was expected before the health care law the law extends the solvency of the medicare part a trust fund as we ve explained before most of this reduction in spending comes in medicare part a or hospital coverage through a reduction in the growth of payments to hospitals medicare payroll taxes which fund part a are either immediately spent by medicare as they come in or they re put in a trust fund medicare gets a bond for that tax money from treasury and any time medicare wants to cash in that bond it can treasury has to pay it even if treasury already spent the original money on something else cutting the growth of medicare spending is a good thing without these billion cuts part a s trust fund is expected to be depleted in but with them that date is pushed back to at that point medicare s payroll tax revenue would only be enough to cover percent of benefits that s if the reductions in spending growth are actually instituted as the law envisions medicare s actuaries are skeptical they have said that many experts believe the price constraints would become unworkable and that congress would likely override them romney said some percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won t take any more medicare patients under that scenario that s close to what medicare s chief actuary richard foster said in congressional testimony in january foster said that his office s economic simulations suggest that roughly percent of part a providers would become unprofitable within the year projection

chance lisbon and madrid would not need rescuing spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero also said madrid would not need to tap any european union funds to help it through its debt problems but called for a much more integrated fiscal policy for the euro zone what spain advocates is that if we have a single currency it s not enough just to have a central bank a single central bank it s not enough to have a single monetary policy we also need to have a common economic policy zapatero said germany has defied calls by france and others to turn the euro zone into a fiscal

are we excited about a whole bunch of nothing it seems the economy isn t getting any better so for those of us hoping to go to grad school the question has become is it even worth it out there in the

professionals who are jobless grad school used to mean you were writing your ticket to a better job and a better life but it doesn t seem to mean that anymore in this economy grad school only guarantees you one thing higher debt but despite the doom and gloom of our state of affairs my pondering led me to the same thought i ve always had grad school is the place for me grad school and higher education were never meant to be a means to an end more money and a bigger house rather grad school and higher education were and are supposed to be a search for yourself it s true that grad

for spaceshipsthe canadian built robotic arms built for nasa s space shuttle fleet and the international space station are about to get two new siblings last week the canadian space agency showed off the next generation canadarm ngc prototypes which were unveiled after three years of development at canadian company macdonald dettwiler and associates the mechanical limbs are the successors to the shuttle fleet s canadarm and station s which played pivotal rolls in the station s construction for more than a decade the csa and mda plan to use this technology to position canada for newer space business opportunities in areas such as in orbit refuelling of satellites said gilles leclerc the agency s director general of space exploration we prepared all these new systems so that we will be well positioned for the next thing in space leclerc said however the canadian government s million contribution to the arm project as well as supporting testbeds and simulators has only brought them to the prototype stage so far the arms will require more money for launch configurations and a ride to orbit fuelling competition one of the prototype arms spans feet meters the same length as the space station s but the new arm is lighter and has two sections that telescope into each other this makes it more suitable to fold up inside the smaller spacecraft of the future photos building the international space station the other ngc prototype arm is a miniature at feet long meters like the station s dextre robot which it is modelled after it will be able to refuel satellites grapple tools and manipulate items such as blankets that cover satellites manufacturer mda has spent several years touting the benefits of satellite refuelling which the company says would save money since satellites could be kept aloft longer if they can receive more after launch in march mda signed a million agreement with intelsat sa to advance this concept but the deal was scuppered in january after receiving lukewarm interest from potential customers nasa is also considering robotic refuelling there is debate among canadian space circles as to whether mda could contribute to nasa s project since it is a canadian company future government funding the csa s contribution to ngc came from one time stimulus funding it received in the federal budget between and now the agency is trying to figure out its priorities in the next few years amid large budget cuts and with future government funds to ngc in flux the canadian government recently began cutbacks to address its deficit and csa was among the affected departments csa faces a percent budget drop to million cdn million in the year after money will fall even further to million cdn million the agency is doing an internal review to determine its priorities with the lesser budget said leclerc work on the international space station will come first since the canadian government agreed to take part in the station until he said csa s approach will be to maintain signature technology to develop while placing resources where it can he said the agency s priorities will also be determined by an external review of the canadian aerospace sector that should be submitted to the government in the coming months canadarm s legacy canadarm has a cherished spot in canadian space history because its success eventually led to the astronaut program the first canadarm flew in space in on sts the second space shuttle mission nasa was so impressed by the robotics that it invited the canadians to fly payload specialists on future shuttle missions the first canadian marc garneau flew in he has since called it a pay to play arrangement subsequently canada provided four more canadarms to nasa between and one was lost on challenger as well as the next generation that was installed on the space station in over the years the arms have grappled satellites hoisted astronauts and assisted on construction and repairs to the international space station one of the original canadarms was converted into an orbiter boom sensor system a foot extension for shuttle arms built to inspection orbiter heat shields as part of safety procedures implemented after the loss of columbia in the boom remains on the space station today in the wake of the shuttle s retirement three first generation canadarms remain nasa kept one for

together the economies of the u s canada and mexico allowing manufacturers and farmers to more easily do business across an immense economic space but trump says some u s manufacturers have moved jobs to mexico so he wants to impose steep tariffs on imported goods from that country because nafta is a multination treaty signed by congress changing it would not be a trivial matter prasad said it s going to be difficult to roll back trade agreements that already exist still trump could slowly strangle nafta by making life potentially difficult for firms doing cross border business prasad said that can be accomplished by aggressively using enforcement mechanisms to hassle companies could nafta be killed not in letter but in spirit yes he said step impose tariffs trump has threatened to impose big tariffs on imports from certain countries to force concessions to trade deals he also says he would use tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the u s tax free moody s analytics says such tariffs would hurt many u s industries particularly autos oil and technology which rely heavily upon international supply chains however it would be positive for industries facing severe import competition such as steel and manufacturing subsectors the moody s report said economists say the danger

provided buses between and a m and and p m ended some bus riders have been left fending for themselves the service provided about rides in one recent year common councilwoman pat boy who chaired a committee meeting on the issue monday said much work remains before residents can hope to see any form of the service return the object of this is to find out the facts and figure out where we can go she said one idea attendees discussed is starting an on demand service as opposed to the fixed schedule and route service the city runs during the day in such a scenario bus riders would call for the service when they need it even with grant funds difficult to come by councilman marc espar cautioned against using riverboat money to pay for expanding bus service we re trying to expand it to a point that s within our means he said complicating the matter further michigan city transit director cranston harris said the department has an aging fleet of buses that needs to be partially replaced i would like for them to get me some larger transit buses because what we have now is faltering he said get that fixed first and then let s help the people by getting some extended service on after we take care of our aging fleet harris said he also would need new vehicles for the type of on demand service proposed bus riders signed petitions last year to try and save the extended hours service but to no avail one rider who collected dozens of signatures margaret picur said after monday s meeting she is optimistic the service will be restored in some fashion the extended hours service cost about in the grant year like public transit elsewhere revenue from riders doesn t cover the full cost of operating the service that year it generated about in income all comments will be reviewed prior to

orleans the man with pinpoint accuracy who is drilling the relief well meant to plug bp s runaway well is looking forward to finishing his mission and celebrating with a cigar a dinner party with his crew and a trip somewhere quiet to unwind with his wife john wright has never missed his target over the years successfully drilling relief wells that were used to plug leaks around the world people along the gulf coast aren t the only ones hoping he can make it for anyone who has ever worked extremely hard on a long project wants to see it successfully finished as long as it serves its intended purpose wright who is leading the team drilling the primary relief well said in a lengthy e mail exchange with the associated press from the development driller iii vessel that is where my job satisfaction is derived bp began work on its primary relief well in early may to permanently seal the ruptured well but about two weeks ago around the time the company had done a successful static kill pumping mud and cement into the top of the well executives began signaling that the bottom kill procedure might not be needed even the government s point man on the spill response retired coast guard adm thad allen suggested that was possible allen put that uncertainty to rest on friday and saturday saying the relief well would be finished so the well could be killed the bottom kill in which mud and cement will plug the well from below the seafloor won t be started until at least next weekend wright said he would not have been disappointed if the relief well was halted recalling the time his high school football team won the city championship in houston in i never made a touchdown or scored a point but i was proud to be part of the team that won and that i had done my job said wright who has two daughters and three grandchildren the deepwater horizon rig exploded april killing workers and causing million gallons of oil to spew from bp s well a mile beneath the surface of the gulf of mexico wright said he was part of a team that started planning the relief well in may working to hours a day seven days a week he has been on the ddiii rig nearly nonstop since june offshore we sleep when we can and work when we have to wright said it is rare to sleep eight hours straight unless we are on standby wright said the bp well was the biggest job of his career but it s only the latest in a long line of wells that began after he earned a graduate degree from texas a m university his work took him around the world from venezuela to norway convincing him this was how he wanted to spend his life by the mid i had developed an obsession that drilling relief wells and working on blowouts is what i wanted to do with my career he said the work on the bp well has been an intense stop and go project with wright drilling only a short distance at a time so his team can then do tests to make sure he s still on target if not the crew adjusts the drill s trajectory before restarting to date he and his team have drilled nearly feet more than three miles the grapefruit sized drill bit is about feet from their target which is less than half the size of a dart board the unusual depth the relative weakness of the rock and the high pressure in the well have made the task challenging the planning was equally arduous for what wright says is one of the most complex jobs he s ever worked on one team had to figure out where wright needed to drill to kill the well and another had to work out how to get there in general the shallower the intersect the harder it is to kill the deeper the harder and costlier it is to intersect wright said more difficult than the work wright said is getting everyone to agree on how to do things the process has often been slowed with so many officials from bp and the federal government involved many additional hours in meetings and preparing justifications are necessary to get a consensus than normally would be required on a lower profile blowout response operation he said wright who is not a bp employee but is working on a contract basis is senior vice president of technology for houston based boots coots international well

neighborhood someplace that the middle class abandoned decades ago but that image may no longer be apt as several recent reports have stressed more americans are now living below the poverty line in suburbs than in cities and thanks in part to the great recession suburban poverty continues to rise sharply what s more many suburbs may not be as well set up as urban areas are to provide much needed social services researchers fear that porous suburban safety nets are leaving a growing number of struggling americans without access to the basic assistance they need to get them through hard times and before such needs get met experts say policymakers need to reckon with the changed state of poverty in america we have to first change our perception and catch up to the new reality of where poverty is elizabeth kneebone a researcher with the brookings institution s metropolitan policy program told the upshot it s still a problem in cities but it s an increasingly suburban problem as well as recently as more poor americans were living in cities than in suburbs but since then according to a report released earlier this year by kneebone and a brookings colleague emily garr the ranks of the suburban poor have grown by percent more than twice the rate that poverty increased in the nation s cities as a result although the poverty rate remains higher in cities by last year million more poor people were in suburbs than in cities this trend was under way before the economic downturn began in late but researchers say that the great recession appears to have exacerbated it this recession has had an economic effect on suburbs that past recessions haven t says scott allard an expert on poverty and social welfare at the university of chicago this is the first time suburbs have experienced significant levels of job losses some ground level reporting has helped flesh out the picture of growing suburban poverty the proprietor of a food pantry in northern california s suburban san mateo county recently told cbs news that in her charity had given out food bags this year she said it ll be between and bags why is suburban poverty disproportionately on the rise one reason say experts is that the recession was triggered by a slowdown in the housing market as foreclosures mounted particularly in suburban and exurban developments that meant that industries dependent on that market which also tend to be based in suburbs were among the most severe casualties construction real estate manufacturing these are more suburbanized industries and they were hit first and hardest says kneebone not surprisingly the rise in poverty and joblessness has put greater strain on social service providers in suburban areas a report released this month by allard and his university of chicago colleague benjamin roth no relation to this reporter found that percent of suburban nonprofits are seeing more clients with no previous connection to safety net programs but these providers who administer programs such as temporary assistance for needy families welfare cash assistance and the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly the food stamp program may not be equipped to deal with the flood that s in part because thanks to the broader economic climate many of them are experiencing cutbacks in their own private and public funding more fundamentally observers say many suburbs whose residents have in the past been disproportionately affluent simply aren t set up to serve the poor as allard and roth found most suburban communities lack the kind of social service programs commonly found in urban areas which have been grappling with poverty for decades and some suburban nonprofits have trouble raising money from donors because of the perception that poverty is predominantly an urban ill as a result allard said he found thatin many communities where need was rising providers had fewer resources fewer programs fewer staff to help and that creates kind of a bitterly ironic situation for low income populations as they seek to cope with job loss find work and provide for their families advocates for the poor are urging the government to boost support for service providers so that those serving suburban communities can be adequately funded without taking scarce resources away from urban providers but given enormous federal and state deficits that may be a tough sell and the problem isn t likely to get better anytime soon even if the economy picks up just as the poverty rate has been increasing in the suburbs for years it s not like once we hit recovery the poverty rate will diminish says allard this will be an issue that these communities will have to deal with for a while\n", ["T2"]], ["irs has million in undeliverable ill refunds the

flow of crude after a series of unsuccessful attempts to stem the flow of oil a mile underwater the tide appeared to be turning in the months long battle to stop the massive oil spill bp plc said wednesday it was finally able to force the oil back down to its underground reservoir with a slow torrent of heavy mud in an early step toward plugging the well up for good the news came as a federal report indicated only about a quarter of the spilled oil remains in the gulf and is degrading quickly with the rest contained cleaned up or otherwise gone but for the people who lost their livelihoods or still see oil washing up on their shores the news is little consolation there are still boats out there every day working finding turtles with oil on them and seeing grass lines with oil in it said

admiral insist that crews will shove mud and cement into the reservoir feeding the well through the foot relief well which should be completed within weeks but for reasons that were unclear bp officials have in recent days refused to commit to pumping cement down the relief well saying only that it will be used in some fashion bp officials have not elaborated on other options but those could include using the well simply to test whether the reservoir is plugged we have always said that we will move forward with the relief well that will be the ultimate solution bp senior vice president kent wells said wednesday afternoon we need to take each step at a time clearly we need to pump cement if we do it from the top we might alter what we do with the relief well but the relief well is still a part of the solution the ultimate objective is getting this well permanently sealed whether the well is sealed or not there s still oil in the gulf or on its shores nearly million gallons of it according to the report released wednesday by the interior department and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration that s still nearly five times the size of the exxon valdez spill which wreaked environmental havoc in alaska in but almost three quarters of the nearly million gallons of oil that leaked overall has been collected at the well by a temporary containment cap been cleaned up or chemically dispersed or naturally deteriorated evaporated or dissolved the report said the remaining oil much of it below the surface remains a threat to sea life and gulf coast marshes noaa administrator jane lubchenco said but the spill no longer threatens the florida keys or the east coast the report said president barack obama while noting that people s lives have been turned upside down declared that the operation was finally close to coming to an end an experimental cap has stopped the oil from flowing for the past three weeks but it was not a permanent solution

to prevent three power reactors from melting down after last week s devastating earthquake and tsunami this is an almost unthinkable challenge a similar accident happened at one reactor at three mile island many years ago but japan s rescue effort is taking place in near battlefield conditions on a site that is truly a no man s land the nuclear reactors at the fukushima daiichi and fukushima daini power stations were automatically shut off after the earthquake but with external power lost and local backups damaged by the tsunami emergency cooling systems failed to work this has forced japanese authorities to improvise and find other ways to keep the reactors cool prevent pressure from building up inside the vessels holding the fuel and prevent the reactor cores from melting significantly without full knowledge of everything japanese authorities have done since the crisis began it is too early to properly evaluate the country s response but even as we wait for all the facts there are early lessons that we all can take from the nuclear crisis in japan the world should be building and operating modern nuclear reactors countries should build and operate nuclear reactors that use the latest and safest technology available and licensing standards need to be improved regularly the reactors at fukushima are years old and would never be given a green light for new construction by japanese regulators today but china and india two rising powers that plan to invest considerably in nuclear energy are continuing to use year old designs for new construction in february the japanese government was prepared to permit the oldest of the fukushima reactors to operate for another years after its license expired this year countries should not be over reliant on nuclear energy last week s earthquake and another one in knocked out of reactors operated by tokyo electric power company on its two sites in northern japan if a country greatly depends on nuclear power for electricity a major nuclear accident can trigger an electricity supply crisis policy makers can also face significant pressure to continue operating reactors even under unsafe conditions if the country is over dependent on nuclear power relying on nuclear energy requires significant know how and resources with the threat of global warming and burgeoning energy demand around the world nuclear power has gained favor dozens of countries have announced an interest in starting nuclear energy programs and existing operators are looking to bump up their operations but japan s crisis underscores that generating electricity by using nuclear fission requires the best know how infrastructure management experience and resources available new plants must meet essential preconditions for safety and international cooperation should ensure that plants can withstand possible emergencies companies and countries must plan for the worst both earthquakes that set back tokyo electric were stronger than had been expected there is a clear need to re evaluate how seismic risk analysis is done to make sure that nuclear power plants are built to weather the worst threats they could face safety concerns must not take a back seat to energy production or prestige for many newcomer nuclear countries especially those facing dire energy needs the temptation may be great to get new nuclear power plants on line as fast as possible critical aspects of nuclear programs that won t contribute to profits or generate power such as spent fuel and waste management and emergency preparedness cannot be neglected by governments and industry leaders aiming to achieve fast results or save money given the global impact of nuclear disasters it is in all of our best interests to ensure that nuclear operators can effectively handle unpredictable and even extreme external events that impact their installations it will take time to fully understand the extent of the crisis in japan but there are steps that can be taken today that will make the world s nuclear programs safer the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of mark hibbs\n", ["T1"]], ["tsx falls as resource stocks make hasty

expectations beijing needs to reverse course after imposing lending curbs this year to prevent a bubble in stock and real estate prices this tells us economic growth is continuing to slow said economist zhu jianfang of citic securities in beijing if they don t make changes the economy will see a danger of further sliding economic growth slowed from a blistering percent in the first three months of the year to percent in the second quarter as beijing rolled back its stimulus after china rebounded quickly from the global slump chinese leaders say they want to steer growth to a more sustainable level but the slowdown was sharper than many analysts expected a further fall in chinese growth could have global repercussions if it hurts demand for u s and european factory equipment

earlier its lowest level this year retail sales and investment in factories and other fixed assets also slowed the consumer price index or cpi rose percent over a year earlier its fastest rate this year as summer flooding wrecked crops and disrupted shipping the jump was driven by a percent surge in food costs but analysts expect inflation to fade quickly july s cpi reading is likely to mark the high point for the year said tom orlik an analyst for stone mccarthy research associates in a report with price pressures set to fade the government will be free to focus on supporting growth a statistics bureau spokesman said the declines in economic indicators for july were not big and could be positive for official efforts to improve china s economic efficiency he gave no sign the government plans to change policy the fall in economic indexes is mainly a result of the government s active macro controls said the spokesman sheng laiyun at a news conference appropriate declines in economic growth are helpful to prevent overheating and also are good for accelerating economic structural changes beijing wants to reduce reliance on exports and investment to drive growth by boosting domestic consumer spending and developing technology and service industries but millions of jobs still depend on export driven manufacturing and construction private sector economists have lowered forecasts of china s growth this year due to the credit curbs but say it easily should meet the government s target of percent the slowdown could complicate moves by beijing to allow china s currency the yuan to rise in value china said in june it would allow a more flexible exchange rate after holding the yuan steady against the dollar since late but as demand at home weakens officials will face pressure from exporters and their allies in government to avoid any steps that might make chinese goods more expensive abroad growth in spending on factories real estate and other fixed assets in the

principle in fact more than one principle this budget as a statement of our national values upholds the american principles of opportunity security responsibility and fairness it upholds the principle of fairness with tax cuts for the middle class for percent of the american people it upholds the principle of fairness with health care for all americans as a right not a privilege the budget will not only create a healthier america but by lowering health care costs health care reform is entitlement reform by curtailing the rising costs of medicare and medicaid health care reform will significantly reduce the deficit this budget upholds the principle of opportunity by advancing the president s investments in education from early childhood through post secondary education and training it supports the president s goal of improving education and training a workforce that is prepared to compete and succeed in the global economy this budget upholds the principle of security the first responsibility we have as elected officials is to keep the american people safe i m proud that in doing so in this budget it gives the biggest increase ever to our veterans this is the first time a president has submitted a budget which exceeds the veterans independent budget i hasten to add that in the last congress the new direction congress exceeded the veterans benefits under the leadership of chet edwards and mr spratt as well on the battlefield the military promises to leave no soldier behind and when they come home we promise to leave no veteran behind this budget upholds the principle of responsibility the budget resolution begins the process of turning around the republican budget legacy of deep deficits mounting debt and economic decline due to the bush administration s reckless fiscal policy it takes steps to put the budget back on a fiscally sustainable path by restoring fiscal responsibility and cutting the deficit by more than one half by it upholds the principle of responsibility for our planet by investing in science technology and renewable energy resources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil that is a national security issue an economic issue an environmental health issue and a moral issue if you believe like i do that this planet is god s creation and we have a moral responsibility to preserve it it is god s beautiful gift to us and it is our responsibility to convey to the next generation intact decisions are liberating by deciding to support this budget members are freeing themselves from past mistakes and stale assumptions they re unleashing the possibilities of the future this budget is the logical progression of the bold initiatives already taken in the first three months of this year by providing health care for million american children in the schip act and the recovery bill and the omnibus bill s investment in nih cancer research and in health it this congress has done more for health care in america than has been done in decades in terms of education with the investments we made in the recovery act the omnibus the edward m kennedy serve america act and now this budget we have done more for education than has been done in any one other period of time in our history on energy proposals we plow new ground as president obama said we will harness the sun the wind and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories we have made the investments that will spur new growth of energy that we can produce here in america creating new green collar jobs for american workers this budget also allows for fiscally responsible legislation that will promote energy independence over the long term in terms of science we have made bold and new investments in the area of science in both the recovery act and the omnibus we also just passed the landmark public lands bill that will protect two million acres of natural heritage the most sweeping conservation legislation in decades so in terms of energy and the environment we have made historic progress this budget is in stark contrast to the republicans hollow shell budget we must always strive to find common ground here in the congress however when the american people voted for change in november they did not vote to send us here to split the difference they sent us here to make a difference sadly the difference of opinion on this budget is a

of latin america s highest inflation rates and a weakening currency many economics believe chavez will have no choice but to devalue the currency the bolivar by about half early next year at the latest that will make the money in people s pockets suddenly worth a lot less and likely drive inflation while putting imported consumer goods out of reach for poorer venezuelans he s going to have to deal with some very basic mundane capitalist things like reducing inflation which stands at percent said eduardo gamarra a latin american studies professor at florida international university in miami price controls and government subsidies for basic foodstuffs have eased inflationary pressures but a major devaluation would drive prices higher and could worsen scarcities economists say investment in social issues is great but he needs to do other things as well that are going to make that economy more productive said gamarra venezuela s economy grew by percent this year but only because of government spending primarily on raising salaries for many of the country s at least million public employees and paying for thousands of new homes that chavez is giving away said joao pedro ribeiro

black market value of the venezuelan bolivar whose official value is set by the government was double the official rate in july it is now triple the official rate at the heart of chavez s economic challenges is declining productivity in the oil industry which accounts for percent of exports and funds chavez s social programs governing the country with the world s largest proven oil reserves has so far insulated chavez from the fallout of his confrontational polices including a drop in foreign investment but economist david rees of london based capital economics said the government has

first quarter of this year much of that foreign money has come from china which has lent venezuela more than billion in exchange for oil shipments even as he celebrated victory before thousands of jubilant supporters early monday chavez appeared to acknowledge he has let down some venezuelans people are upset by a soaring homicide rate power outages and crumbling infrastructure i pledge to you i repeat to every day be a better president than i ve been he said while also promising greater effectiveness and efficiency from a government whose payroll is bloated by patronage the year old leader has said tests show he is cancer free but his illness has forced him to slow his pace and cut back on his frenetic days of late night speeches and cabinet meetings he s endured two rounds of surgery since june to remove tumors from his pelvic region as well as chemotherapy and radiation treatment venezuela would have to hold a new election if chavez were forced to step down during the first four years of his term more health problems would make it even more difficult for chavez to push ahead with his promised drive to expand the state s role in the economy and provide even more entitlements as long as chavez remains as the key driver here there might be far more inertia than change said javier corrales a u s political science professor at amherst college venezuelans will choose state

said it felt as if there was an earthquake an unidentified man told guatemalan newspaper el periodico that he had been walking with his brother when they heard a loud noise coming from the earth seconds later his brother vanished into the ground other neighbors claim that they saw a taxi cab that was driving through the intersection disappear before their eyes the sinkhole is over feet in diameter almost perfectly round and according to some residents of the neighborhood no surprise at all city authorities blamed the tropical storm for the sinkhole but some people in ciudad nueva say that the ground beneath their feet has been acting strangely for years according to local newspaper reports area residents have claimed that it feels hollow in certain places a few years ago when the

and entered a period of decline it was neglected by city authorities for years and over the past decade residents say they began noticing signs of a shifting earth cracks in their floors fissures in

just a decade ago thanks in part to the bush tax cuts treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday t he policies put in place by the previous administration prior to this great recession have left us with a terrible legacy of challenges geithner said during a discussion on fiscal policy at the washington based center for american progress and america is a less equal country today than it was ten years ago in part because of the tax cuts for the top percent put in place in and the bush tax cuts credited with job creation during the george w bush administration are now credited with expanding the nation s ever increasing national debt more jobs have been destroyed than the tax cuts could ever claim to have created and with the economy in a moderate recovery the tax cuts have become less an economic issue than a political one most republicans hoping to push their supply side theories want to extend them in hopes that the rich will spend invest and create jobs in the process democrats in an attempt to appeal to deficit conscious voters want them to expire so that the increased government revenue can be used to pay down the national debt economists and policymakers while not discounting the positive effects that continued tax cuts can have on the economy have stressed that the best course would be to allow the cuts to expire former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan a noted libertarian who was not opposed to the tax cuts when proposed during his tenure has advocated that they should be allowed to expire the administration too is advocating their demise and on wednesday geithner laid out an argument touching not just on the fiscal and economic benefits he touched on the fairness of it all too the most affluent earners in who earned an average of more than million dollars each that year paid only percent of their income in tax a lower rate than many middle class families he said the legacy of the crisis is millions of unemployed americans idled factories a national debt swollen by eight years of deficit spending and growing income inequality we live in one of the richest economies in the world the treasury secretary continued but one in eight americans is on food stamps today macroeconomic advisers an economic consultancy led by former fed governor laurence h meyer estimated this week that allowing only those bush tax cuts for the richest americans to expire would trim about percent from growth over and but while the group warns against letting all of the tax cuts expire the demise of those benefiting the rich though likely to result in a nominal hit to growth would be worth it the group said g iven the still tentative recovery we believe that the consideration of such large tax increases should be delayed until the economy is growing more strongly the consultancy said in its report an intermediate and safer near term strategy is to let expire in just those provisions affecting high income individuals while extending the other provisions until they can be considered in the context of a healthier economy geithner argued wednesday that extending the cuts for the rich would hurt economic recovery by undermining confidence that we are prepared to make a commitment today to bring down our future deficits fiscal discipline requires hard choices and we must be prepared to make them he said t here is no credible argument to be made that the purpose of government is to borrow from future generations of americans to finance an extension of tax cuts for the top percent related blogs marshall auerback the real

have slammed the u s government lately for demonizing bp instead of simply holding the company accountable for the gulf oil spill but that sentiment has shifted noticeably since bp ceo tony hayward s testimony before the house energy and commerce committee thursday hayward s inability or unwillingness to answer a number of direct questions about the decision making that preceded the spill cost him many of his job responsibilities today together with a good deal of his erstwhile cheering section in the british press the times of london didn t go easy on the oil executive summing up its analysis of his performance in washington with the headline from mr bean to mr has been for bp s tony hayward the times giles whittell wrote that hayward had a chance to save his career and the good name of his company by giving forthright detailed answers to highly specific questions submitted in advance by two of the most astute and enlightened men in congress instead hayward he wrote seemed to have prepared by taking beta blockers whittell argued that hayward stonewalled congressional interrogators despite the executive s claims to the contrary the guardian clearly agreed with that assessment in its own piece on the hearing bp oil spill tony hayward stonewalls congress although hayward was carefully coached by legal and media teams and was testifying under oath the guardian noted he failed to satisfy also according to the guardian hayward delivered his answers in flat impassive tones in the telegraph pr branding specialist mark borkowski wrote that hayward s communication skills didn t rival those of a tax inspector the new age demands a front and centre spokesman who can make the audience feel like he is listening and actually gives a damn borkowski wrote but tony hayward doesn t seem to have learned a great deal about being inclusive about engaging with the public accused of stonewalling he stonewalled borkowski continued he couldn t or wouldn t answer most of the questions in fact he looked like a tired undertaker who was rather bored with having to look mournful photos haunting images of the oil disaster still other british commentators had plenty of rancor left for the united states and its political leaders rupert cornwell a columnist for the independent added to the criticism that others in the british press have leveled against the obama administration and congress that they re unfairly piling on bp even as the company tries to clean up its mess cornwell wrote that yesterday s grilling of mr hayward is a century version of the medieval stocks public disgrace for the public villain of the moment while cornwell harkened back to medieval times to describe hayward s treatment on capitol hill the daily mail went back even further for a historical comparison the british paper reported that hayward was subjected to a grilling so savage yesterday it was more like ancient rome than capitol hill wave after wave of criticism flew the way of the hapless boss and his company the daily mail continued confirming them both as public enemy no in the u s the economist more highbrow than the typical fleet street tabloid came out swinging at the obama administration in the issue on newsstands friday however the economist s ire isn t motivated by jingoism or knee jerk america bashing it s far too genteel for such tabloid sport instead backed by its faith in free markets and neo liberal trade policies the economist came out in support not just of a british company but of business itself which it judged to be unfairly maligned in the spill fiasco america s justifiable fury with bp is degenerating into a broader attack on business the economist s editors wrote in today s lead editorial the economist expressed concern that business leaders who are already gloomy depressed by the economy and nervous of their president s attitude towards them will likely not be encouraged by the treatment of bp because obama s now pushing firms into doing his bidding the magazine s characterizaion of efforts to hold bp responsible for an environmental catastrophe of its own making the economist draws parallels between the president and russia s strong armed former president and current prime minister hence the editors new nickname vladimir obama so while tony hayward is now a tarnished british hero in the tony blair vein national

economics and supply demand forces would easily eclipse any control exercised by a bunch of bureaucrats and money changers a couple of trillion dollars in stimulus and bailouts later we ve got a call into mom it turns out that many of her suspicions may have actually been right regardless of whether you feel the laws of economics are ultimately controlling the financial state of our nation or it s a secret sect of faceless power brokers who are pulling the strings it illustrates how the economy and hence the process of buying and selling homes isn t always rooted in sheer financial reality we re all susceptible to our emotions at times emotion gets the best of us and forces us into an unproductive path other times it guides us with a gut feel that is often more right than wrong as real estate agents our goal is not always to reason why but to understand our clients perspective that brings us to the subject of this week s column the idea that although buying or selling houses is a serious matter standing back and having a good laugh at the trials and tribulations associated with buying and selling houses is always an excellent way to defuse the great stress that also comes along with the process it s true that there are hundreds of thousands sometimes even millions of dollars as part of a real estate deal but there are also less serious aspects that might make you laugh we ve had a few let s call them experiences and any agent who s been in the business for a while can tickle your funny bone with a tale or two so this week there s no graph no talk about how the cpi might affect the cci and impact the upi if you re like us you occasionally need a break from the numbers and all the serious analysis when you ve been a real estate agent for as many years as we have you collect a variety of events that stay with you some good and some bad but all memorable here are a few that come to mind whenever we show homes different buyers each have their own pace and process for looking a house over some are pretty quick about it and then there are others that seem to want to experience what it s actually like living there so they tend to take a long time there s one buyer we ll always remember as part of looking at a house he would also take soil samples we never heard about what he did with those samples but a scoop of dirt into a plastic bag was part of his drill the same guy also measured all the rooms even on houses he didn t like we told him that the room dimensions were in the listing but he seemed to take great delight in discovering that the kitchen was actually feet inches wide instead of the the agent noted in the listing he never did buy a house so we guess the soil sample failed to meet his standards another time we were showing a house in a nice neighborhood over in prince george s county as we drove up to the house there were some toys in the yard and what looked like one of those plastic snakes coiled up on the porch as i approached the door what i though was plastic started to unravel itself not liking snakes i returned to the safety of my car along with the buyer we watched a foot black snake slither up the front door and somehow disappear behind the door jamb the buyer turned to me and she said i don t think i m interested in this house recently we ve had a spat of people who tell us they re looking to buy a house but in the end they turn out to be up to something else the first was a guy who emailed us from iraq he said he was a colonel in the air force i googled the name and it checked out there indeed was such a guy he said he was interested in buying a specific house in south river landing it was a million dollar home so we were more than delighted to help him unfortunately it all started to feel a bit fishy he wouldn t give us a phone number and wanted to pay cash we went along with the phone number thing for a while believing that if he were in a war zone calling might be difficult but then after pressing him some more he sent us a picture of someone in the u s military sitting next to a pallet load of cash this was his evidence of being a serious buyer for us it signaled a scam eventually he just disappeared after being burned on that one we were determined to be a bit more suspicious next time around if we couldn t talk to someone on the phone we weren t going to do work for them so when our next dream buyer emailed us and provided his cell phone number we let our guard down a bit i gave him a call and he was a perfectly delightful gentleman he said he was moving his business to annapolis would need about square feet of class a office space for his employees and wanted to spend around on a house for himself he describe in great detail the type of office space he was looking for going so far as to even talk about the type of lighting the need for a break room and a location that would accommodate the ability to walk to different lunch spots he had been to annapolis before so he was familiar with the lay of the land at his request we fedex d him some listings this guy had a sparkling personality and would talk your ear off for hours he d go on telling me about his tile business he even told us about the time in la when he met ruth buzzy from the television show laugh in and how he had also met jim nabors who was kind enough to loan him his rolls royce for a couple of days it was interesting conversation there was only one problem the entire thing was a fantasy when we checked the address for the fedex it was going to a nursing home of sorts in north carolina we called the facility and found out that our buyer was actually a patient there we ll never know if he ever really did meet jim nabors and get to use his rolls but this guy definitely wasn t moving a tile business to annapolis as you can see there s never a dull moment in the real estate business there are many more stories where these came from some of these experiences

furious protesters gathered outside government buildings in dublin late sunday and the country s newspapers described it as a nation s outrage the irish cabinet s request for aid was approved by eu finance ministers during an emergency conference call late sunday as officials moved to quell fears that the debt laden nation could spread contagion to weak euro economies finance minister brian lenihan said ireland was left with no choice but to accept external help because it faced a very difficult market position and an extraordinarily difficult banking crisis which had deepened our difficulties immeasurably he said one of the key conditions of the deal was that structural change was required to ireland s banking system but claimed it would be an intensification of the type of measures we have already adopted lenihan said it would take several weeks to finalise the exact amount of the bailout and added we have not determined a precise figure diplomatic sources in brussels put the figure for the bailout at between to billion euros to billion dollars cowen said the bailout will address the budgetary challenges of the irish economy in a decisive manner on the basis of the ambitious budgetary adjustment and comprehensive structural reforms contained in a four year budget plan given the underlying strengths of the irish economy decisive implementation of the programme

simple reason the chief executives of europe s leading car makers are in london for the annual board meeting of acea milan ace mi news the european automobile manufacturers association however the commitments the industry leaders are making while they are in the uk are about more than timing they are a significant vote of confidence in the uk as a manufacturing base and the government s desire to rebalance the economy nissan is to invest in building and developing the next generation of the qashqai in the uk while bmw xetra news will spend over the next three years on mini production nissan and bmw already build the qashqai and mini in the uk but that does not make the investments insignificant it shows the confidence they have in the productivity of their uk plants which are believed to be among the most efficient in the world and also that the government is creating an environment where investment in manufacturing is attractive this substantial investment by bmw is a massive vote of

british car makers such as jaguar land rover rolls royce bentley and aston martin all these factors are a promising base from which the government can try to grow automotive manufacturing in the uk

using the lanes several years ago trepp and her husband who live in port orange were cruising the st johns river in their houseboat when they were struck by another boat their houseboat took on water and sank within minutes as the boat went down trepp said her foot got caught in the wreckage she almost didn t make it out alive in august trepp experienced another less dramatic but far more common boating problem running out of gas after towing another stranded boat trepp needed a tow herself getting pulled to the dock was so mild compared to some other boating mishaps she s been through that she actually called the experience relaxing it was especially relaxing because she has a boating club membership with a national boat towing company the bill was like but because we had boatu s we paid nothing she said in volusia and flagler counties seatow and towboatu s come to the aid of stranded boaters for a fee boats for the two companies are hard to miss as they cruise around their home docks in ponce inlet seatow s boats are bright yellow while towboatu s s are bright red for a year club members can rest assured that barring dramatic mitigating circumstances there is always someone ready to tow them back to a dock hours a day seven days a week capt paul savia has run the local seatow franchise for years before that he was in the coast guard it was kind of frustrating because it seemed like almost every time we got a call to assist someone the seatow guys would beat me there and i was in the coast guard savia said so at the end of my tour of duty i looked into getting into the private sector and doing this these days the coast guard leaves most of the towing and assisting jobs to private tow companies according to derrick dolph of towboatu s the coast guard steps in when there are added elements of danger really the only time that we re gonna decline a call is you know if the situation is something that we cannot help it s more or less if a life is in peril anything where there s a medical condition on a vessel dolph explained if a life is at stake that s where the coast guard needs to be involved if it s a boat that s at stake that s something we would handle a job might still be potentially dangerous even if lives aren t at imminent risk savia said it s up to the tow captain to make sure he and the boaters he s towing don t end up in danger for ocean rescues it isn t just wave size that towers have to watch for but also the direction the waves come from how far apart they are and whether it is high or low tide under certain conditions it simply isn t safe to tow a boat through the inlet where the combination of currents waves and jetty rocks produce plenty of hazards in some cases savia said he has towed a boat back to the mouth of the inlet then waited several hours for conditions to change before proceeding inshore always the no driving force is safety not speed not convenience he said as someone who likes to take guests on her boat including employees at the hair salon she owns and groups of girl scouts trepp said she enjoys the peace of mind that comes with knowing she has a backup plan i advise everyone out there who has a boat to be a member of seatow or boatu s she said most boaters are friendly but at the end of the day most boaters are tired they re going to leave you to sit there who needs a towboat any boater might need a towboat from a little john boat with a broken down motor to the foot yacht that capt paul savia pulled off a sandbar in ponce inlet several years ago savia s towboat even came to the rescue of a couple of jet skiers who fell off their vehicle in the ocean savia offers these tips for local boaters to keep themselves and their boats safe and to make potential tows as safe and as simple as possible talk with local boaters to make sure you understand the waters you re in including shifting sandbars and strong currents if storms are predicted don t head far out to sea because if there s a problem it may take several hours for a towboat to reach your vessel and conditions could deteriorate rapidly deep sea fishers should carry enough anchor line to be able to anchor in deep water in case of problems that way the boat won t drift far from your reported position as a rescue boat heads out to sea maintain your boat s radio and set it to a channel the local coast guard and towboats monitor don t just rely on a cell phone in case of emergency because help will arrive more quickly if you contact people already on the water know the ins and outs of your towing contract and

days of its life that speed inhibited intensification but as soon as it slowed matthew began to strengthen matthew reached hurricane intensity sept and since then has been breaking records below are some of the milestones that matthew has achieved so far hurricane matthew underwent a remarkable rapid intensification of mph in hours intensifying from a category hurricane to a category hurricane this was the third strongest rapid intensification in a hour period for any atlantic hurricane on record trailing only hurricane wilma and hurricane felix it also became the first atlantic basin category hurricane since felix matthew is the atlantic basin category hurricane on record one of the remarkable things about matthew during its time in the eastern caribbean n w was its very slow forward speed typically hurricanes have to move at least to mph to not churn up cold water which would significantly weaken the storm but the caribbean is very warm and very deep which means there was less cold water to churn as such matthew has been able to sustain itself as a very strong hurricane for a long time because of its slow movement and strong intensity it has achieved several notable records for intensity and duration hurricane matthew is the longest lived category hurricane in the eastern caribbean on record the storm was a category hurricane for hours which is the longest that a hurricane has maintained such a strength on record during october in the atlantic basin matthew has been a major hurricane category for more than five days the longest lived major hurricane since hurricane ivan one index that hurricane scientists frequently use when they assess integrated effects of a hurricane is accumulated cyclone energy ace this index takes into account intensity and duration of a hurricane hurricane matthew generated the most ace of any hurricane in the eastern caribbean on record as of wednesday morning matthew had generated the most ace by any single atlantic hurricane since igor given the forecast track and intensity of matthew it is likely to be one of the highest generating ace storms of the past years matthew has already devastated portions of the caribbean along its slow northward trek it made landfall as a category hurricane in haiti and then in cuba and is now currently bearing down on the bahamas as such matthew has set some notable landfall records as well it was the first category hurricane to make landfall in haiti since hurricane cleo matthew was also only the third category hurricane to make landfall in haiti on record in addition to flora and the aforementioned cleo hurricane matthew was the first category hurricane to make landfall in cuba since hurricane ike what potential future records are possible for hurricane matthew the latest national hurricane center forecast as well as model guidance indicate that matthew may last in the atlantic for another week or more this would put matthew in rare territory for hurricane longevity especially one this late in the season typically late forming storms have fairly short lifetimes because of the fairly limited regions where hurricane formation conditions are conducive no hurricanes on record have made landfall north of miami along the east coast of florida in october and as mentioned earlier no major hurricanes have made landfall since wilma in each of these records has the potential to be broken in the next few days\n", ["T1"]], ["grand jury to review fatal megabus crashsyracuse n y ap authorities say a grand jury will review the double decker bus

recovery entering new phasebyline by harry r weber and greg bluestein associated press writerstime fri jul pm et biloxi miss bp s new boss says it s time for a scaleback in cleaning up the gulf of mexico oil spill federal officials say there is no way the crude could reach the east coast and fishing areas are starting to reopen there were several signs friday that the era of thousands of oil skimming boats and hazmat suited beach crews is giving way to long term efforts to clean up compensate people for their losses and understand the damage wrought local fishermen are doubtful however and say oil remains a bigger problem than bp and the federal government are letting on other people contend the impact of the spill has been overblown given that little oil remains on the gulf surface but bob dudley who heads bp s oil spill recovery and will take over as ceo in october rejected those claims anyone who thinks this wasn t a catastrophe must be far away from it he said in biloxi where he announced that former federal emergency management agency chief james lee witt will be supporting bp s gulf restoration work after an april rig explosion that killed workers bp s blown out well gushed an estimated million to million gallons of oil before a temporary cap stopped it july efforts to permanently plug the gusher had been expected to begin as early as sunday but the government s point man for the spill said friday that those plans hit a snag crews found debris in the bottom of the relief well that ultimately will be used to plug the leak for good retired coast guard adm thad allen said the debris must be fished out before crews can begin a procedure known as a static kill that hopefully will make the rest of the job easier it s not a huge problem but it has to be removed before we can put the pipe casing down allen said the sediment settled in the relief well last week when crews popped in a plug to keep it safe ahead of tropical storm bonnie removing it will take to hours and likely push the kill back to tuesday allen said once the relief well is ready crews can begin the static kill in which mud and possibly cement are pumped in through the temporary cap the better that procedure seals the blown out well the easier it will be to plug it forever by pumping in cement from below using the relief well the blown out well could be killed for good by late august though a tropical storm could set the timetable back as the work of plugging the well appears to reach the homestretch so does much of the cleanup work relatively little oil remains on the surface of the gulf leaving less for thousands of oil skimmers to do dudley said it s not too soon for a scaleback in the cleanup and in areas where there is no oil you probably don t need to see people in hazmat suits on the beach he added however that there is no pullback in bp s commitment to clean up the spill there had been fears that the massive spill could reach south florida and the east coast through a powerful loop current but federal officials said friday that earlier reports that some oil had reached the current were wrong a new analysis by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration showed most surface oil in the gulf had degraded to a thin sheen what remained on the surface and below was hundreds of miles from the loop current noaa administrator jane lubchenco said a strong eddy is preventing oil from reaching the current so there s no mechanism for oil to get from where it is now at the surface to the keys miami dade to any place along the east coast lubchenco said mississippi alabama and the florida panhandle will likely be spared any additional major beach oiling although tar balls could wash ashore noaa said louisiana s coast was the most likely place where oil could still make landfall lubchenco cautioned that scientists will continue studying the potential effects of the subsurface crude diluted and out of sight does not mean benign she said but in those concentrations there will be minimal impact to the big things that are out in the ocean big fish big marine mammals birds she said scientists still don t know the oil s environmental effect underwater for help with the long term recovery bp has hired witt and his public safety and crisis management consulting firm witt who was fema director under president bill clinton said he wants to set up teams along the gulf to work with bp to address long term restoration and people s needs our hope is that we can do it as fast as we can witt said i ve seen the anguish and the pain that people have suffered after disaster events i have seen communities come back better than before bp and witt s firm refused to say how much witt will be paid for his work commercial fishermen meanwhile were allowed back on a section of louisiana waters east of the mississippi river on friday after federal authorities said samples of finfish and shrimp taken from the areas were safe to eat about percent of louisiana waters are now open to some kind of commercial fishing but state waters in mississippi and alabama remain closed and so do nearly a quarter of federal waters in the gulf reinforcing the state s declaration that louisiana seafood is safe to eat was u s food and drug administration commissioner margaret hamburg at a news conference in new orleans she said fish showed levels of contaminants that were extremely low significantly below the threshhold of concern hamburg stressed that testing will continue because of the large volumes of oil spilled and the large amounts of dispersants used to break it up seafood industry representatives hailed the reopening but rusty graybill a boat captain from yscloskey la who fishes for crab oysters and shrimp said it s a joke i m pretty sure i ll go out and i ll get oil covered shrimp they capped this well and now they re trying to say it s ok he said graybill a wiry year old with a leathery tan made a inch circle with his thumb and finger i m still finding tar balls this big out there and the boom is still covered in oil he said louisiana fisherman pete gerica couldn t work up much enthusiasm either he noted that it doesn t include crabs or oysters and that shrimp season in most of the area has yet to open if you can t crab in these areas it s a flop gerica said oil rig workers are struggling along with fishermen because a federal moratorium on new deepwater drilling in the gulf of mexico those workers will be getting million in aid that bp said friday it will distribute through a louisiana charity there is no official estimate of how many people have been out of work since the interior department imposed the moratorium in june drilling has since been suspended on exploratory wells the fund is focused on people who worked on the rigs drilling those wells not people who provided support services such as ferrying supplies to them said mukul verma a foundation spokesman those people might get money if there is any left over after grants are provided to rig workers bp spokesman tom mueller said bluestein reported from new orleans associated press writers jason dearen in yscloskey

knox olivier knox tue dec pm et washington afp us president barack obama s contentious deal with republicans to avert a new year s tax hike steamed tuesday towards final senate approval piling pressure on rebellious house democrats to accept the deal senators were to vote late tuesday or early wednesday on the package after pushing it over a key procedural hurdle on monday by an unusually large margin that fueled calls for quick house of representatives approval obama s democratic allies in the house who rejected the pact in a non binding vote last week were to meet late in the day to weigh their options said democratic house majority leader steny hoyer some democrats have called for toughening the agreement s inheritance tax provisions which set that rate at percent and only affects estates over five million dollars but republicans have warned that could kill the deal hoyer said the senate vote highlighted the urgency of approving a bill to extend massive tax cuts passed in and but expiring on january but said many in his rank and file were pretty cold to the agreement the legislative process is a process of give and take and invariably you end up with bills that you like some things in it and you may not like other things he told reporters sounding a conciliatory tone the package extends unemployment benefits by months and adds two years to middle class tax cuts passed in and but due to expire january obama angered many of his democratic allies by bowing to republican demands that the package also extend tax cuts that directly benefit only the richest sliver of us earners as well as accepting a rollback of the inheritance tax senators were expected to hold their final vote late tuesday or early wednesday after obama spurred angry democrats to swallow their objections and back the billion dollar package i urge the house of representatives to act quickly on this important matter obama said monday seeking a restorative political victory before lawmakers go home for the holidays if there s one thing we can agree on it s the urgent work of protecting middle class families removing uncertainty for america s businesses and giving our economy a boost as we head into the new year he said it was not clear whether house democrats angry about the inheritance tax had the votes to toughen the agreement or whether they would heed republican warnings that major changes would kill the compromise some lawmakers have warned that obama will not be able to get as good a deal in january when democrats lose five senate seats and hand control of the house to republicans republican senate minority leader mitch mcconnell warned democratic house leaders to bring the measure to a vote without political games or partisan changes designed only to block this bill s passage in the house if the house democratic leadership decides to make partisan changes they will ensure that every american taxpayer will see a job killing tax hike on january he

should be repealed you work all of your life to earn money taxed to build something to leave your family you accumulate property and assets that you then pay sales city school county and state taxes on any earnings that you make on your assets are asessed are taxed as income if the value of your assets increases then you are hit with a capital gains tax and the taxes go on and on these are the price you pay to have these things and then when it is time to pass on what you have built up to your survivors the government steps in for what they see as their share over of it i do not see where they have the right to take a cut of what is rightfully yours this is not a socialist or communistic society where supposedly everything is shared equally if by your actions and hard work you have accumulated assets with your already taxed income then it is yours to do with as you wish without anything being taken for the good of the masses if you want more of the pie get off of your butt and work for it why should my heirs be forced to sell off of my hard earned work in order to keep what i have worked so long and hard for to give them a start on leaving something for the people in their

the hispanic community concludes that the increasing unemployment among hispanic workers during the recession and the increased disparity in unemployment rates between hispanic workers and the overall

san francisco and san jose the objections raise the prospect that the bullet train line may not reach san francisco one of its key destinations it s a hurdle that high speed rail planners could face in other heavily populated areas of california as they embark on the nation s most ambitious intrastate rail project threatening delays that could stall the project for years if extensive opposition surfaces if completed as planned the rail system would stretch miles and link the san francisco bay area sacramento fresno los angeles anaheim and san diego with trains running at speeds of up to mph california s line and a midwestern project are the likely front runners for billion in federal stimulus money dedicated to development of high speed and conventional rail it s not clear whether delays either through neighborhood opposition or lawsuits would jeopardize california s share by the time the entire california high speed rail system is completed the total cost is expected to top billion in some of the neighborhoods south of san francisco residents are urging the state high speed rail board to consider tunneling trenching or making san jose the system s terminus in the bay area that step would require riders to take commuter trains from the heart of silicon valley to san francisco others suggest a different route perhaps taking the trains off the peninsula and reaching san francisco through an underwater tube from oakland their allies in the california legislature have inserted language into a pending bill that would require the rail board to consider a different san jose to san francisco route than the one currently selected we re supportive of high speed rail but we have some deep concerns over potential implementation said patrick burt a city councilman from palo alto a peninsula community about miles southeast of san francisco palo alto and four other peninsula cities atherton belmont burlingame and menlo park have joined to create a unified voice on the project atherton menlo park and palo alto also are involved in a lawsuit challenging the rail board s selection of the pacheco pass as the primary route for trains between the bay area and the central valley they say a more northerly route through the altamont pass would be the better choice making altamont the primary route could leave all or some peninsula cities untouched by high speed rail depending on where tracks are placed last year s bond measure designated the san francisco to los angeles and anaheim segment as the first built state officials hope to have it finished by links to san diego and sacramento could follow shortly after depending on funding said mehdi morshed the rail board s executive director planners have settled on the corridor used by the caltrain commuter line as the best high speed rail route on the peninsula but they haven t decided if trains will run above or below ground they also haven t determined if tunneling would be more expensive than other alternatives part of the mile long corridor is wide enough for caltrain and high speed rail tracks to run side by side in narrower sections tracks might have to be stacked or the state might have to obtain adjoining property through eminent domain morshed said that has some residents worried that elevated trains will split their communities that the rail board will need to expand the right of way or both a web site established by a group of peninsula residents features pictures depicting the transformation of menlo park s picturesque tree lined caltrain station into a barren place with trains

in urban centers menlo park vice mayor richard cline estimates seven to miles of tunneling could be necessary to avoid major impacts on peninsula cities morshed said the board will have to consider terminating high speed trains in san jose if environmental obstacles and public opposition are too daunting but rail board member quentin kopp a semiretired judge and former state senator said a san jose terminus would violate voters intent when they approved proposition san francisco mayor gavin newsom also would fight any attempt to stop the trains short of his city a mayoral spokesman said the

all his tough talk about excessive pay for bankers the obama administration s pay czar let the executives go without a fight kenneth feinberg announced friday that he would not try to recoup billion in compensation given to top executives at bailed out banks because he thought shaming them was punishment enough his decision to go easy on banks that made ill advised payments to their executives is likely to fuel concerns about how he will oversee the billion oil spill compensation fund created by bp i m not suggesting we should blink or turn the other cheek feinberg said later in an interview with the associated press these companies were singled out for obviously bad behavior the question is at what point are you piling on and going beyond what is warranted he could not force the banks to repay the money but the law instructed him to negotiate with banks to return money if he determined that the pay packages were contrary to the public interest language that he opted not to use still his leniency is a far cry from the bravado he displayed in the months leading up to his final act as pay czar in february he spoke with confidence about his ability to get companies that received taxpayer help to accept less in an interview with the hill newspaper feinberg said he had been fairly successful in convincing the companies that it is in their best interests to seek an accommodation on compensation among the companies feinberg did not pursue were two whose bailouts are expected to cost taxpayers more than billion american international group inc and cit group inc he also ignored excessive pay at wall street powerhouses such as goldman sachs group inc and jpmorgan chase co which reaped massive profits from government efforts to stabilize the financial system they had no trouble repaying their bailouts he said a fight with those banks could have exposed them to lawsuits from shareholders trying to recapture the executives money and he did not think that would be fair sen bernie sanders a vermont independent said he was disappointed that feinberg decided there was no way to force the banks to return the bonus payments these people s jobs were saved by the taxpayers of this country and their response was to give themselves these huge bonuses sanders said many americans lost their jobs because of this wall street greed it is one of the reasons the american people

said it s not the first time feinberg has talked tough but taken a light touch with bankers he clashed publicly with aig ceo robert benmosche while quietly approving a pay package worth more than million he announced in october that he had cut cash pay by percent at the handful of companies that got the biggest bailouts yet the changes were not retroactive they only applied to the final six weeks of that year that track record concerns some gulf state officials alabama attorney general troy king announced thursday he will file suit against bp to recover tax revenues lost because of the oil spill and to recoup cleanup costs at the news conference he said feinberg seems to be working more for bp than for the people harmed feinberg strongly defended his independence from bp saying his actions speak for themselves i think both the administration and bp will acknowledge my absolute independence feinberg said he added that anyone who believes he went easy on the banks hasn t carefully read what i did over the past months and what i did today regarding these rather than demanding they return the money feinberg invited the banks that overpaid workers to give their boards of directors more power to withhold pay during future crises the request was voluntary feinberg reviewed companies that received bailout money before pay curbs were enacted by congress in february the review covered the period from october to february the starting point was when banks began receiving bailout money under the troubled asset relief program the ending point was when congress enacted pay curbs

slowed to a percent pace its most sluggish showing in nearly a year and too weak to drive down unemployment consumers spent less companies slowed their restocking of shelves and the nation s trade deficit dragged more on the economy in the april to june quarter in a separate report the commerce department said the recession was deeper than previously estimated together the reports raise doubts about whether employers will hire enough and consumers will spend enough to invigorate the economy as unemployment remains near double digits congress could feel pressure to pass more stimulus measures to speed the recovery so far republicans and some democrats have blocked additional spending because of their concerns about the size of the deficit investors reacted to the report with disappointment stock futures fell in the hour before the markets opened however losses moderated in morning trading after the university of michigan reuters consumer sentiment index for july rose slightly more than expected the commerce department report released friday did offer some encouraging news businesses invested the most in years on equipment and software during the second quarter for the first time in two years builders boosted spending on commercial projects and home builders spent the most in years although many expect that to fade now that government homebuying tax credits have expired the report also showed that the economy grew at a percent pace in the first three months of this year that was much better than the percent pace estimated just a month ago still the recovery has been losing power for two straight quarters that raises concerns about whether it will fizzle out or worse tip back into a double dip recession the economy began to grow in the third quarter of last year after having suffered the worst recession since the great depression and in the following quarter the economy s growth surged at a percent pace the high water mark of the rebound much of the expansion was driven by the government s massive billion stimulus package of tax cuts and increased spending also companies helped energize growth with a burst of spending to replenish inventories that were cut down during the recession now as those forces are fading concerns are growing as to whether the private sector can boost spending and investment enough to keep the recovery afloat consumer spending usually the lifeblood of economic activity slowed in the second quarter such spending rose at an anemic percent pace that was down from a percent pace in the first quarter and was the weakest showing since the end of last year instead americans saved more they saved percent of their disposable income in the second quarter the highest share in a year the percent growth rate logged in the april to june quarter was the weakest since a percent pace in the third quarter of last year when a record streak of four straight losing quarters came to an end the economy is growing but not enough to make most americans happy at this weak pace it will take more time than many hoped for people to really feel the benefits of this upturn said joel naroff president of naroff economic advisors in the revisions issued friday the government estimated that the economy shrank percent last year the steepest drop since that s worse than the percent decline originally estimated the economy s plunge underscores why the unemployment rate surged to percent in october a year high with the economy growing at a subpar speed the current percent unemployment rate is not expected to fall it takes about percent growth in gross domestic product just to create enough jobs to keep pace with the population increase growth would have to equal percent for a full year to drive the unemployment rate down by percentage point neither the obama administration nor the federal reserve expect that to happen gross domestic product measures the value of all goods and services from machinery to manicures produced within the united states it is the best gauge of the nation s economic health the weak economy leaves democrats and republicans on capitol hill vulnerable as they head into the november midterm elections democrats who now control both chambers have the most to lose the gloomier outlook is also a liability for president barack obama however there were some encouraging signs in terms of business spending spending by businesses on equipment and software increased at a blistering percent pace in the second quarter builders boosted spending on commercial projects such as office buildings and plants at a percent pace and home builders who have cut spending for the last two quarters ratcheted up their outlays at a hot percent pace the most in nearly years still with the expiration of the government s homebuyer tax credit housing activity has started to turn sluggish again looking ahead though businesses still aren t showing signs of ramping up spending that would translate into the explosive kind of growth needed to drive down unemployment uncertain about the strength of the recovery companies are sitting on record piles of cash loath to use the money to hire new workers and expand operations caterpillar inc dupont co and microsoft corp are among companies reporting strong second quarter earnings in the past two weeks yet they aren t ready to bulk up their work forces there is a high degree of uncertainty there is a recovery under way it is going to be choppy said united states steel corp chairman and ceo john surma earlier this

recently as two months ago the federal reserve sounded optimistic about the economic recovery now the central bank is clearly more worried and economists say there s not much more it can do to help the fed said tuesday that it would spend a relatively small amount of money about billion a month economists estimate buying government debt the move is designed to drive interest rates on mortgages and corporate borrowing at least a little lower and help the economy grow faster in a statement after a one day meeting the fed said the pace of the recovery has slowed in recent months after its last meeting in late june the fed was rosier saying that the recovery was proceeding and the job market actually improving the decision to buy government debt using proceeds from fed investments in mortgage bonds was a shift from earlier this year when the fed was laying out plans to roll back some of the measures it took during the financial crisis at that time the fed was also preparing a strategy to begin raising interest rates again a step taken to keep a growing economy from overheating now though the fed has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero i don t think they are going to raise interest rates until it is very clear that unemployment is moving definitively lower and that doesn t look likely until late said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics economists pointed out that buying billion of government debt in a trillion economy is a relatively small move and they said they did not expect it to have a dramatic impact the fed talked loudly but carried a small stick said joel naroff president of naroff economic advisors he said that while the financial system has the money to lend banks are unwilling or unable to find suitable loans to make until they do he said the recovery will be softer than anyone hoped for and there may be little the fed can do about it with interest rates so low congress economists note has more power than the fed

year treasurys by using the proceeds from debt and mortgage backed securities it bought from fannie mae and freddie mac it said that it would buy additional government debt as its existing treasury

there will be a new tax proposal on the table in the house house resolution with the support of five congressmen will be introduced for legislation the bill is titled the fair tax act and would

rob woodall and missouri s billy long both republicans if enacted the new law would be the first major overhaul of the tax structure since the creation of an income tax steve king of iowa has a nice video explaining how a fair tax would work woodall says he has co sponsors of the bill and fresh faces willing to support the measure a national sales tax would be based upon the gross domestic product gdp of the united states the higher the gdp the more sales taxes the united states would collect it would make the budget of the united states more in line with the current economy if sales go up the budget goes up if sales go down the federal budget goes down of course special interests will still want their fair share should congress have a sales tax on everything one example of a possible exemption would be if a business buys parts from a supplier who in turn sells the finished product upon which sales tax is paid automobiles are a perfect example should gm pay sales taxes on specialized car parts needed to assemble a car should a car dealer pay taxes on the wholesale price of the car before the retail price is paid by the consumer you will need exceptions for the poor who shouldn t pay any sales taxes since they can hardly afford the necessities of life charitable organizations would also likely be exempt from paying sales taxes depending upon who is exempt taxes on corporations are basically abolished and the consumer driven economy funds the federal government the more personal consumers spend the more money uncle sam takes in perhaps a fair tax will be a good thing if the government wants more money to be spent then giving incentives to personal consumers to buy things is a good idea having a tax holiday would be all the stimulus the economy needs instead

constitution states the congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived wouldn t abolishing the irs mean another constitutional amendment is needed to reverse prohibition in the amendment the states had to ratify the amendment nearly years later another thing for lawmakers to consider is that sales taxes can rapidly fluctuate from year to year if

banking i would say we did not discuss this option trichet told a news conference after a meeting of the ecb s governing council four days later the ecb announced that it would start buying bonds trichet s u turn was part of an emergency package with euro zone leaders to stave off a crisis of confidence in the single currency by reaching for its nuclear option the ecb had also helped rewrite the manual of modern central banking that s happened a lot over the past three years since the early days of the financial crisis in the european central bank the u s federal reserve and the bank of england have all been forced to adopt policies that just a few years ago they would have dismissed as preposterous and the bank of japan responded to the sendai earthquake and tsunami by doubling its own asset purchase programme to keep the banking system of the world s third largest economy on an even keel for a generation the accepted orthodoxy has been to focus on taming inflation financial stability has taken something of a back seat now whether mandated to do so or not western central banks have bought up sovereign debt to sustain the financial system printed money by the truckload to stimulate their economies sacrificed some of their independence to coordinate monetary policy more closely with fiscal decisions and contemplated new ways of preventing asset bubbles some such as bank of england governor mervyn king have joined wider political protests at commercial banks that are still behaving as if they are too big to fail and as if being bailed out is just a hazard of business in the measured world of central banking it amounts to nothing short of a revolution otmar issing one of the euro s founding fathers and a career long monetarist hawk told reuters that in buying government bonds the ecb had crossed the rubicon the question now for the ecb and for its counterparts in britain the united states and elsewhere is what they ll find on the other side extraordinary circumstances don kohn a former vice chairman of the federal reserve realized central banking was changing forever at a routine meeting of his peers in basel switzerland in march the shockwaves from the u s subprime mortgage meltdown had begun rocking banks around the world and kohn a year veteran of the u s central bank listened as one speaker after another described the fast deteriorating economic conditions it was terrible kohn said one of the people at the meeting used the phrase it s time to think about the unthinkable kohn left the meeting early to return to washington but the line stuck in his head he would use it a few days later to justify his support for a federal reserve decision to spend billion to help j p morgan buy investment bank bear stearns which was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy that financial meltdown caused a credit crunch that triggered a severe recession and in countries such as greece a sovereign debt crisis after slashing interest rates practically to zero central banks desperate to prevent a new global depression had no choice but to expand the volume of credit rather than its price by reaching for the money printing solution known as quantitative easing qe in the eyes of critics federal reserve chairman ben bernanke was living up to his nickname of helicopter ben a reference to a speech that he gave in in which he took a leaf out of the book of the renowned monetarist economist milton friedman and argued that the government ultimately had the capacity to quash deflation simply by printing money and dropping it from helicopters until that point the fed was a lender of last resort for deposit taking banks by invoking obscure legislation from the great depression it also became a backstop for practically any institution whose collapse could threaten the financial system kohn and others at the bear stearns meeting had just done the unthinkable when the secretary of the fed board was reading off the proposals my heart was racing randall kroszner a fed governor at the time says of the decision an academic economist from the conservative free market oriented university of chicago kroszner was instinctively against intervention at the same time he knew that a decision by the fed to stay above the fray would trigger financial panic before the meeting kroszner had chatted with bernanke another scholar of economic history about a historic parallel in which financier j p morgan the person not the company opted against stepping in to save the knickerbocker trust precipitating a financial panic in the first decade of the century i couldn t believe that we were faced with these questions and i couldn t believe that i could support them kroszner told reuters in february in these extraordinary circumstances it was very risky to just say no by the time the billion second round of quantitative easing wraps up in june the central bank will have spent a staggering trillion more than percent of gdp buying bonds it has also created new lending windows to channel funds to financial institutions and investors and expanded its financial safety net for everything from money market mutual funds to asset backed securities and commercial paper the fed argues that its loans have been repaid without any cost to taxpayers and that the beginning of a recovery in the u s economy and the fading of the threat of deflation which gnawed at bernanke justify its bold improvisation but some experts including a number of fed officials themselves believe the central bank is paying a big price some critics say the fed s open ended provision of next to free money is encouraging more reckless risk taking by banks and speculators others say the fed has exceeded its remit and encroached on the turf of politicians some republicans in particular want to curtail the fed s powers the united states has not been alone in britain the bank of england has run its own programme of quantitative easing spending billion pounds about percent of gdp mostly on uk government securities and has introduced a scheme for financial institutions to swap mortgage backed securities for uk treasury bills the ecb took three main steps adjusting its money market operations to offer unlimited amounts of funds lowering standards on the collateral it accepts in such operations and buying bonds the bond buying though amounting to percent of euro zone gdp is less radical than the fed s because the bank absorbs back the money that its purchases release but its initiative is still highly controversial issing the ecb s chief economist from to calls the bond buying dangerous but he also concedes that the problems of the past few years have required extreme measures it is difficult to justify within the context of the independence of the central bank says issing but on the other hand the ecb was the only actor who could master the situation what matters now is that it finalizes this programme and gets out blowing up the orthodoxy central banks have historically often been subordinated to governments but the high inflation and slow growth that followed the oil price shocks of the ushered in a relatively simple orthodoxy their goal should be to keep inflation in check maintaining a slow and steady pace of price rises became the overriding aim of central bank policy and independence from political pressures came to be seen as a pre requisite for achieving this starting with new zealand in central banks in more than countries adopted explicit public targets for inflation western governments claimed this was responsible for the great moderation a two decade period of relatively stable growth in developed economies it still has many proponents but the credit crisis has made a mockery of that overriding simplicity exposing serious flaws in how central banks defined their mission and operated one flaw they did little to prevent the build up of the asset bubbles that triggered the financial crisis such as the boom in u s subprime mortgages another the obsession with inflation blinded them to dangerous trends in banking after all what is the point of keeping inflation low if lax lending and feckless financial supervision threaten to tip the economy into the abyss the problem was not that the fed lacked instructions to avoid a crisis says james hamilton a professor of economics at the university of california san diego and visiting scholar at the central bank on multiple occasions the problem was that the fed lacked the foresight to see the crisis developing fed chairman bernanke doubts central banks can know for sure that an asset bubble has formed until after the event and feels monetary policy is too blunt a tool to arrest any worrisome developments at the same time bernanke former vice chairman kohn and others agree that the central bank might be able to employ broader tools to prevent asset prices from getting too frothy for example the fed regulates margin requirements for buying equities with borrowed funds it could use these to rein in a galloping stock market the simplicities of extreme inflation targeting which said if you meet your inflation target and keep inflation stable the rest of the economy would look after itself have been blown apart sir john gieve who was deputy governor at the bank of england from to told reuters the bank s objectives have become a lot more complicated some people have been quicker to realize this than others if you talk to the japanese they would say they have been doing this for a while any answers could the fed and its counterparts in britain and europe learn from asian central banks many of which limit the proportion of deposits that banks can extend as loans should they insist that a home buyer make a sizeable deposit when taking out a mortgage a practice that might have tempered the u s housing bubble central banks in some emerging economies outside asia already appear to be adopting such methods known as macroprudential steps to complement traditional interest rate policy turkey has been raising commercial banks reserve ratios while simultaneously cutting interest rates and brazil signaled this month it would rely more on credit curbs and less on rate increases to fight inflation or should they look closer to home for example to the central banks of australia and canada both are inflation targeters but they sailed through the global crisis without having to resort to extreme measures a history of conservative banking regulation in those countries meant they never faced severe credit problems prior to the crisis a lot more people were of the view that if it s not broke don t fix it said dean croushore professor of economics at the university of richmond in virginia and a former economist at the philadelphia federal reserve policymakers didn t react particularly with respect to housing maybe being a bit more proactive is a good thing then again some republican lawmakers want the fed which has a dual mandate to keep inflation low and maximize employment to focus exclusively on the first task they contend that monetary policy is not the right tool to create jobs buying up bonds and bailing out failing firms does indeed blur the boundaries between monetary and fiscal policy critically it also suggests that supposedly autonomous central banks are doing the bidding of politicians things cannot change in a measured way said european central bank policy maker axel weber earlier this month he is also head of germany s bundesbank but last month he stood down as a candidate to succeed trichet at the ecb his outspoken opposition to the bank s bond buying underlined the rift between the traditional approach to central banking and the political expediency born of the crisis there will have to be fundamental change if institutions are too big to fail they are too big to exist weber said echoing comments by king at the bank of england more intrusive the shift is already happening bond investors are not facing a future change they are living through a change said gieve the former bank of england deputy governor inflation remains very important and i have no doubt my colleagues at the bank of england take it very seriously but they are also aware of the need to stabilize the financial system they need to get the economy on a sustainable growth track of course the fed has never operated in a vacuum greenspan swiftly cut interest rates after the black monday stock market crash in october and again in september after the fed had to organize a billion rescue of ltcm a big hedge fund but some experts including stephen roach morgan stanley s non executive chairman in asia have long argued that an explicit financial stability mandate would force the fed and other banks to pay closer attention to looming bubbles and weak links in the system rather than simply mopping the mess up later legislators are giving central banks more powers to keep an eye on financial as distinct from monetary or economic trends academics have also broadened their reach in that direction with the federal reserve s prominent jackson hole conference last summer featuring a paper arguing that policymakers should pay closer attention to financial variables in their macroeconomic assessments that s exactly the direction things are headed since the beginning of this year ecb boss trichet has chaired something called the european systemic risk board esrb a body designed to take a bird s eye view of europe s financial system and flag up emerging problems so the relevant authorities can act in britain the government has decided to disband the financial services authority and give the bank of england the job of preventing any build up of risk in the financial system on top of its monetary policy role and in the united states newly enacted legislation gives the fed a leading role in financial regulation as part of the financial stability oversight council from a regulatory standpoint we ll be more aware and more intrusive in monitoring institutions that are systemically critical dallas fed president richard fisher told reuters in an interview politics of course with those expanded roles comes a greater need for central banks to explain their actions to citizens markets and politicians alike investors will no longer be able to anticipate how policy makers will act just by tracking inflationary trends as they did for a generation before the great financial crisis bernanke made it a priority from the start of his tenure in to improve communications he didn t have to do much to improve upon his oracular and sometimes opaque predecessor alan greenspan who famously said if i turn out to be particularly clear you ve probably misunderstood what i ve said but the crisis exposed the fed to withering fire it s hard to maintain mystique when there have manifestly been a series of policy errors not just at the fed but in many branches of government says maurice obstfeld a professor of economics at the university of california at berkeley even harder when the big central banks themselves have yet to work out how they will implement their new powers the new rules in the united states for instance give regulators more leeway to wind down global financial institutions deemed too large to fail in case they touch off a catastrophic domino effect as loans are called in but how that will work in practice remains to be seen at the end of the day it comes down to whether or not the too big to fail resolution mechanisms are robust there s still some thinking to be done on that david altig research director at the atlanta fed and a professor at the university of chicago s booth school of business said in a telephone interview to judge by comments by weber and king that s a big unanswered politically charged question the boe chief has been vocal in complaining that the concept of too important to fail has not been addressed and that bankers continue to be driven by incentives to load up on risk then there s the fact that deciding which firm should live and which not is an intensely political process look no further than the furor over the u s authorities decision to bail out insurer aig and car maker gm but to let investment bank lehman brothers go to the wall months after arranging a rescue of bear stearns with an expanded awareness of their mandates wouldn t central banks be forced to take into account such dilemmas when they are setting interest rates it s a risk but one has to be aware of the risk and to avoid it says issing the former ecb chief economist it s macroeconomic supervision it s not micro control of individual banks but if the european systemic risk board identifies systemic risk it must be solved with tools of regulation and not by lax monetary policy a fact of life in truth central banking by its nature has always been an intensely political enterprise to pretend otherwise is naive war revolution depression and calamity have always subjugated central banks to political necessity and most are still state owned like a country s highest court a central bank cannot no matter how vaunted its independence be unaware of the political and social mood the fed chairman and the u s treasury secretary worked hand in glove during the financial crisis and have the freedom to discuss a range of topics when they meet informally every week the political nature of central banking was brought home last month when weber decided to stand down early he had judged that he did not have enough political support from the members of the euro zone and his relationship with german chancellor angela merkel was also rocky he will hand over to jens weidmann merkel s economic adviser critics of the appointment and there is no shortage of them in a country that likes its central bankers tough and independent worry that weidmann will weaken the bundesbank s statutory freedom from political influence that misses the point completely says david marsh co chair of the official monetary and financial institutions forum which brings together central banks sovereign wealth funds and investors marsh says the launch of the euro in was a political act itself one that has already led to a much more politicized regime of monetary management the interplay with governments whatever the statutes say about the supreme independence of the european central bank is a fact of life he says the mistakes and miscalculations of the last years show how monetary union has to be part of a more united political system in europe that is not loss of independence that is political and economic reality it is against this backdrop that trichet s apparent conversion on the road from lisbon to brussels last may must be seen niels thygesen a member of the committee that prepared the outline of european economic and monetary union in says the euro zone debt crisis forced the ecb to show some flexibility by agreeing to the bond buying programme it is a departure relative to the original vision for the european central bank which was supposed to be a bit isolated from dialogue with the political world he says on the other hand i never thought that was quite a tenable situation thygesen now a professor at the university of copenhagen said he did not particularly like the idea but acknowledged that the ecb might in fact have gained some clout by agreeing to the bond buying plan trichet helped rally euro zone leaders into arranging standby funds and loan guarantees that could be tapped by governments in the currency bloc shut out of credit markets relieving the ecb of some of the burden of crisis management it was part of a bargain and i m sure mr trichet bargained very hard and in a way successfully says thygesen the ecb has stood up well and gained substantial respect for its political clout in bringing about actions on the part of governments which otherwise might not have taken place lessons from japan it doesn t always work out that way just ask the bank of japan the boj embarked on quantitative easing as far back as but a decade on it has still failed to decisively banish the quasi stagnation and deflation that has dogged japan s economy since the early only once in the past decade in has japan experienced inflation of more than percent the central bank s benchmark for price stability when the global crisis hit the boj revived a scheme to buy shares from banks and took a range of other unorthodox steps to support corporate financing but its actions failed to placate critics who view it as too timid senior figures in the ruling party and opposition parties talk of watering down the boj s independence and forcing it to adopt a rigid inflation target the government tends to blame everything on the boj kazumasa iwata a former boj deputy governor told reuters makoto utsumi a former vice finance minister for international affairs defended the bank s current set up saying it would be absurd and unthinkable for a developed country like japan to make its central bank a handmaiden of the government the bank s prompt response to

london school of economics who was on the bank of england s monetary policy committee from to believes a measure of central bank independence can be preserved even if cooperation with ministers is needed to keep the banking system stable i think trying to maintain the independent role of the central bank in interest rate setting remains a very good idea he told reuters when it comes to financial stability issues at any rate under certain circumstances and at certain times there will have to be a greater involvement of the government how to achieve that balance is the subject of a whole other debate none of this is going to be quite in the separate boxes it has been in the past says gieve the former bank of england deputy governor if you have inappropriate monetary policy all the macroprudential instruments in the world will find it very difficult to push water up hill importing inflation as if the political dimension was not enough of a headache central bank rate setters seem to be finding it harder to nail down the sources of the inflation they are tasked to fight one reason is globalization central banks have traditionally turned a blind eye to a one off rise in prices stemming from say an increase in consumption taxes a sharp drop in the exchange rate that boosts import costs or as now a spike in oil as long as the price jolt does not change inflationary expectations or worm its way into the broader economy by prompting workers to ask for higher wages policy makers have usually felt comfortable in keeping their eye on underlying cost pressures at home that remains the consensus as demonstrated by the bank of england which has failed to keep inflation down to its percent target for much of the past five years but in a world of integrated supply chains can inflationary impulses be neatly attributed to either domestic or international forces does it now make sense as some analysts argue to estimate how much spare capacity there is globally not locally the answers to those questions will have huge implications for monetary policy lorenzo bini smaghi one of six members of the ecb s executive has warned that sharper rises in the prices of commodities and goods imported from emerging economies will push up euro zone inflation unless domestic prices are controlled a permanent and repeated increase in the prices of imported products will

inflation outlook in complete isolation from the rest of the world perhaps global inflation will drive u s prices higher or cause other problems he told a business breakfast in kentucky in february the ties that bind global banks and the ease with which capital flows across borders mean that central banks have to be more aware than ever of the international consequences of their policy actions because the dollar is the dominant world currency the fed came under widespread fire for its second round of bond buying critics in china and brazil among others charged that dollars newly minted by the fed would wash up on their shores stoking inflation and pumping up asset prices how do we conduct monetary policy in a globalised context asks richard fisher the dallas fed president how do we regulate and supervise and develop our peripheral vision for those that we don t supervise in a formal way in a globalised context not easy structural shifts in the world economy also raise questions about how long central banks should give themselves to hit their inflation goals further blurring the picture for investors the central bank always has the choice of the time horizon over which it hits its inflation target thygesen the copenhagen professor said as the bank of england is now learning it may have to extend that horizon somewhat in particularly difficult circumstances there may be good reasons for doing it but that is where the element of discretion lies the bank of england expects inflation to remain above target this year before falling back in the ecb which seeks medium term price stability is resigned to inflation remaining above its target of just below percent for most of in the last months it stood at percent it all adds up to a significant shift in the environment in which central banks operate policy making is a whole lot more complicated with a broader mandate for keeping the banking system safe comes increased political scrutiny with fast expanding export economies like china becoming price setters instead of price takers offshore inflation and disinflation are of growing importance if the rise in oil prices is due to increased demand from developing nations for instance can western central banks still play down ever higher energy bills as transient that all means it will become tougher for central banks to preserve their most precious asset

each biennium said it does not take a ph d in economics to know that we can t say yes to every spending need adding that compromises must be made to prioritize the most pressing state needs hutchinson said his plan incorporates savings arkansas has already reaped partly due to the state hiring freeze and a consolidation of five state agencies executive actions supported by the legislature have eliminated more than government positions the governor said hutchinson also said savings will come from future streamlining such as moving war memorial stadium under the wing of the department of parks and tourism the department of human services will also see million in savings under his administration s proposed plan hutchinson said the governor then highlighted potential boosted funding for education mental health services and the foster care system hutchinson suggested a million increase to higher education for the second year of the biennium saying his plan rewards institutions for student success and not just student enrollment he also allocated million to pre kindergarten to improve the quality of classroom instruction and attract qualified teachers hutchinson said a task force recommended creating three crisis stabilization centers to help local law enforcement and first responders better serve mentally ill people who inundate county jails and prisons he said million should go toward the effort the state foster care system is a compelling problem needing help as the number of children in the program grows year after year hutchinson said he proposed increasing

libraries and senior citizen centers after those amounts were previously reduced as for taxes hutchinson said his plan reflects a necessary and cautious and conservative approach he suggested a million cut beginning in the second year which would have a minimal million impact by the fiscal year through the cut hutchinson said he will continue to focus on the reducing the income tax burden on arkansans and grow our economy after outlining his proposal hutchinson informed lawmakers there is no money in his budget set aside for legislative or executive general improvement funds the governor

enables them to get a faster refund when they ve suffered casualty losses a gift of time after a disaster filing a tax return or making a payment isn t going to be the top priority for a business owner and it also might be impossible to do either task when the president makes a disaster declaration in a stricken area the irs sets new deadlines for area taxpayers for example on april two days before this year s deadline for filing income tax returns tornadoes and floods hit parts of north carolina stricken counties were declared a federal disaster area the irs then gave taxpayers until june to make their filings and payments and that included tax returns and after a disaster declaration in parts of illinois after april storms and flooding business owners were given until june to make payments that includes their estimated tax payments due june the government also waived late payment penalties for taxes including employment and excise taxes the extensions are automatically available if you live in a place that has been declared a disaster area if you re outside a disaster area you can still ask the irs for a reprieve you need to call the irs disaster hot line at to make your request a business owner can also get an extension if the records needed to make a filing or payment are located in a disaster area even if the owner isn t that could happen if you had a warehouse with records miles away from your home or business getting your tax refund now not next year if you suffer losses in a federally declared disaster the irs gives you the option of amending your previous year s return to claim a casualty loss even though it happened this year for example the people in the south and midwest who had losses from storms tornadoes and flooding can amend their returns to include this year s losses that will get your refund money to you faster and many taxpayers need that money now not next april the irs website www irs gov has a lot of information about casualty losses and taxes you can download publication casualties disasters and thefts there is a second on disaster area losses the publication is included in the irs disaster losses kit for businesses which can be downloaded at www irs go v pub irs pdf pdf but before you rush to amend your return you should consider whether you d be better off deducting your losses this year if your business is still operating and you re expecting this to be a very profitable year you might be better off taking the deduction for and offsetting your income with losses from the disaster as with any other tax decision this one should be made by considering all aspects of your business it s always a good idea to sit down with an accountant or tax attorney and discuss your options especially when your emotions may be running high if you do decide to amend your return you ll need to file a special form corporations will need form x amended u s corporation tax return sole proprietors who file a

continent on a seismic scale of magnitudes from one to ten it registered to in actual energy released it far outdid the great san francisco quake of for one and a half to four minutes as if under the

down a yawning crevasse in one night of primordial terror some lives were lost and over million in damage was sustained for centuries men have accepted these catastrophes fatalistically indeed the human race has a heroic capacity for picking itself up and forgetting such disasters almost before the last tremors fade but evidence is growing that the alaskan quake marks a real turning point while the reverberations from aftershocks still continue and rebuilding goes on apace a long range scientific effort is at last getting under way to solve the riddle of what causes earthquakes the hope is that this study will make it possible to develop a warning system against big quakes whose surprise factor is the worst menace to human life and to prescribe protective measures against their most damaging effects the alaska quake was the most observed earthquake in history by easter sunday of that tragic weekend the u s coast and godetic survey had flown in five special portable seismographs from its laboratory at albuquerque new mexico to get a full record of aftershocks it also installed fifteen strong motion seismographs the first in alaska to study the vibrations of buildings under

panel of experts appointed by donald f hornig the president s chief science adviser is realistically weighing the prospects of finding a method to predict big earthquakes recommendations for a broad national and international program are expected early this year it could happen even in new york the effort is long overdue for earthquakes are by no means uncommon occurrences in the u s forty eight major convulsions have been registered so far in this century in alaska and the aleutian island arc the nation s most active earthquake area a close second with fewer big quakes but many smaller ones is the west coast region but these are by no means the only danger zones the utah montana wyoming triangle has been active recently a century and a half ago three big quakes in quick succession struck new madrid missouri and in charleston south carolina was devastated the mid mississippi valley the southern coast the st lawrence river valley and even the new england area around boston are all seismic regions that have been active in the past the fact that an area has been quiet for a long time is no reason to believe that it will not be struck tomorrow with catastrophic results even to such a seemingly impervious city as new york in the last fifty years alone the u s has sustained at least billion in earthquake damage and the cost is bound to rise as urban areas spread and grow more complex the alaskan earthquake simply precipitated a rising belief that the time has come to do something about the problem only a few years ago any suggestion that earthquakes could be predicted would have drawn snorts of quackery from the profession for the gaps and uncertainties in knowledge were so great that forecasting was out of the question the uncertainties are still very big but hopes have been raised by the great advance and confluence of the earth sciences from geology and geophysics to oceanography armed with important new information from nuclear bomb testing and space the basic earth sciences have been in vigorous upheaval for a decade or more and this ferment augurs well for finding a solution because the problem of earthquakes reaches down deep into the origin structure and dynamic behavior of the earth itself interestingly enough most of what knowledge there is of the interior of the earth comes from the seismographic study of earthquakes other instruments measuring the earth s gravity magnetic field and heat flow have contributed much valuable supporting data and in the future may add even more but the most useful of all tools is the seismograph invented only late in the last century by the englishman john milne while he was sojourning in quake ridden japan the seismograph is essentially a pendulum or delicately balanced weight suspended in a rigid frame on bedrock which transmits and records electrically the relative wave motions of the earth under shock long intricate analysis of these seismic waves their directions velocities travel times refractions and reflections through the layers of the earth enabled seismologists to build up a gross picture of the earth s interior with a fire in its belly this is the now famous three layered model of the earth a very thin crust covering an enormously thick solid mantle enwrapping a molten liquid core subsequent refinements of technique have identified seven distinct layers or shells within the earth but these are essentially divisions of the major three below the crust only a few miles deep stretches the mantle some miles thick to the boundary of the core the precise upper limits of the mantle were discovered in by the croatian seismologist andrija mohorovicic who noted that seismic waves suddenly jumped in velocity only a few miles below the surface of the earth indicating a sharp change in the nature of the materials this transition region is the now famous mohorovicic discontinuity or moho by comparing the velocity rate of shock waves through the mantle with the rate through known materials in the laboratory seismologists were able to infer that the mantle is composed of something resembling a dark dense basaltic rock known as olivine below the mantle some miles down to the center of the earth is the core generally believed to be of a heavy iron nickel composition though recent opinion is veering toward the idea that it is simply a continuation of the mantel material in a different state of matter at these greater depths early seismologists inferred that the whole core was liquid because they discovered that a certain component of seismic waves called shear waves which cannot pass through liquids did not pass through the core but it is now believed that the inner core is solid and only the outer core a molten liquid that at least part of the core is molten is inferred from the probable temperature pressure level at these depths readings in deep mines and boreholes show that the internal heat of the earth rises sharply with depth reaching an estimated fahrenheit only fifty miles down only the increasing weight and pressure of matter which raise the melting point of materials keeps the mantle from being molten in the core the heat outstrips the pressures causing the material to melt the tremendous heat entrapped in the core is generally thought to have come from the compressive forces exerted in the early formation of the earth and from radioactivity in its substance originally about fifteen times more intense than it is now thus the core is still glowing at a temperature estimated at somewhere between and fahrenheit under pressures of nearly million pounds per square inch the earth therefore is a dynamic structure that has evolved over many millions of years just over four and a half billion years according to the precise time clock of radioactive elements in its substance and it is evolving still with a fire in its belly geologists have read the history of its constant change in rocks and rills mountains rise are ground down and continue to rise elsewhere continents emerge in places where once there were seas but the most spectacular and abrupt of all changes occur when the earth shakes for geophysicists it is not enough to know that an earthquake occurs when a fracture or fault in the earth s crust gives way through internal strain or some deep collapse below causing a shear movement or subsidence in the crust these are just local effects earthquakes are intimately related to such larger slower movements as the formation of continents and the building of mountains and to the deep forces within the earth that cause these changes before they can begin to explain and eventually to predict earthquakes geophysicists need to know the general pattern of those forces new cracks in the earth s armor in the last decade or so advances in instruments and techniques have enabled seismologists and other explorers to throw a few shafts of light into some of these deep places much of the advance has been in the sheer organization of instruments on a scale new to geophysics in the international geophysical year leading nations collaborated on a vast physical audit of the earth as part of this columbia university s lamont geological observatory installed the first skeleton network of standard seismographic instruments ever to operate on a global basis following up on the igy work the international upper mantle project set the u s canada west europe and russia to building up standard networks of their own and drilling a series of deep boreholes the most ambitious of which is the u s project mohole see fortune may its object is to drill down to the mohorovicic discontinuity through the ocean floor and to bring back a sample of the mantle itself which has never been conclusively examined before finally to handle the vast amount of data flowing in the ubiquitous computer has been integrated into the whole system to speed up and extend analysis a hundredfold even to the point of directly controlling recording and analyzing seismograms meanwhile the instruments themselves were undergoing great extension and refinement leading the advance was a new class of long period seismographs conceived mainly by hugo benioff of california institute of technology these are able to detect and sort out long earthquake waves undulating around the world through the surface of the crust and upper mantle thus giving scientists a clearer picture of this region they also are able to sort out for the first time the free oscillations of the earth its natural vibrations under rotation from seismography in oil exploration where explosive charges are used to simulate seismic events came sophisticated portable electronic instruments and along with them came methods of arraying instruments over the earth to refine reception and methods of sounding the ocean bottom and sedimentary layers pioneered by lamont observatory s noted director maurice ewing from project vela the defense department s big effort to develop reliable means of detecting underground nuclear explosions came still further refinements indeed techniques have been so improved that seismologists are now able to locate and discriminate between small earthquakes and underground explosions to an extent unheard of a few years ago bringing within reach an inspection system capable of operating entirely outside an antagonistic country and this focus on small events turned seismologists attention to the study of small earthquakes heretofore largely ignored out of all this came some notable discoveries the analysis of long surface waves for instance showed that the crustal layers below the oceans differ considerably in depth density and composition from those below the continents underlying the oceans is a heavy basaltic type of rock only three to four miles deep under the continents is a lighter rock mainly granite some twenty to twenty five miles thick with the roots of mountains extending even deeper than that into the mantle like partly submerged icebergs in the sea this means that the mohorovicic discontinuity instead of being a symmetrical boundary under the crust rises close to the surface under oceans and dips down deep under continents setting up pressures and strains on the rims of continental blocks precisely where most of the great earthquakes occur at the same time long wave studies have also confirmed the suspected existence of a soft layer in the upper mantle some to miles down wave velocities drop in this area indicating that the rock is in a plastic state or even molten in places owing to some temperature pressure imbalance these additional irregularities may further account for earthquakes as well as for volcanoes deeper than the grand canyon perhaps the most provocative geophysical discovery of the decade is a mighty interconnected chain of submerged mountain ridges and valleys see map pages and now known to stretch for some miles under the oceans of the world hints and fragments of this globe girdling chain were glimpsed for nearly a century but its full dimensions were not grasped until the late fifties when the lamont observatory research ship vema and other igy voyagers seismically sounded its main branches through the mid atlantic indian southern and mid pacific oceans and on up the great east pacific rise curling along the american west coast to alaska these underwater mountains are quite unlike those found in the upper world they rise in great sharp rugged scarps of basalt some nearly as tall as the himalayas down their centers run deep long valleys or rifts many deeper than the grand canyon extending for hundreds of miles heat flowing up from the rifts registers higher than almost else on earth along their length relatively small shallow earthquakes and volcanic activity occur in profusion from their bottoms oceanographers have dredged up basalt boulders indicating a continual upwelling of soft or molten matter perhaps from the mantle itself this causes the rising scarps and rifts to spread apart at a small measurable rate analysis of the boulders shows they crystallized out of molten matter no more than ten million years ago indicating that the rifts are a comparatively young feature of the earth all together the rifts form a huge tension crack in the earth s crust running in an almost continuous line nearly twice around the earth in a few places in the world the rifts actually emerge on dry land where they can be observed as steadily widening fissures or crevasses which until recently defied explanation one of these strange formations the famed rift valleys of east africa is now seen to be a landward extension of an indian ocean ridge another a northerly continuation of the mid atlantic ridge runs jaggedly across a great central graben or depression in iceland measurements over the years show that this crevasse is steadily widening at a rate of a fraction of an inch a year and pushing up matter to build up the ridges on both sides is the earth expanding or contracting all these discoveries raise fundamental questions about the evolution and behavior of the earth to begin with a comprehensive theory is needed that will account not only for the familiar continents ocean basins mountains and earthquakes but for all the new phenomena as well in an effort to find an all embracing explanation theories old and new have been brought to a boil perhaps the oldest theory is that the earth has been contracting ever since it began cooling down from its early molten state as speculation goes this shrinking caused the hardened crust to shrivel like the skin of a dried prune as it adjusted to new dimensions thus raising continents and mountains and causing earthquakes old school geologists still cling to this theory but it has been badly weakened in recent years for one thing the theory assumes that the earth was formed as was once widely believed out of a molten blob torn from the sun but modern cosmologists find strong evidence that the earth like other planets was formed by the cold accretion of dust and gases whirling in a primordial disk around the sun only gradually over a period of about a billion years did it heat up to the molten state through compression and radioactivity the amount of contraction that could have occurred in cooling off since then is not sufficient to account for the earth s mountain heights and ocean depths moreover it is highly doubtful whether the interior of the earth has yet lost much of its original heat because its huge mass is a slow conductor and radioactivity is constantly adding heat a newer theory is that the earth is actually expanding this was first suggested about a quarter of a century ago on purely cosmic grounds by the great british theoretical physicist p a m dirac he reasoned that in an expanding universe in which all bodies are seen to be rushing away from one another at a measurable rate the force of gravity in any given body must be gradually diminishing with age even a slight decrease in the earth s gravity unmeasurable as yet by any ordinary means could cause its matter to expand by as much as miles in circumference in billion years the expansion theory long dormant suddenly gained support from the discovery of the mid ocean ridges and rifts for this global system covers a surface area about equal to that of the calculated expansion and the rifts might well be the expansion joints where matter from the swelling interior of the earth is oozing out to form new crust a third major theory of the earth which may or may not include expansion is the theory of continental drift first conceived about fifty years ago mainly by a german geologist named alfred wegener it has acquired many adherents as a result of recent discoveries noting the curious jigsaw fit of continental profiles particularly between the americas and europe africa and the curious similarity of fossil remains in widely separated continents wegener suggested that once there was only one mammoth continent that later was split up since then the continents have been slowly drifting apart floating like great buoyant granitic rafts on the heavy sluggish basalt beneath the drifting continents for years this idea was largely dismissed as fantasy since there was no evidence anywhere in the seemingly solid mantle of any heat currents or other flow mechanisms to give the continents such mobility but lately new information has been piling up to support the idea of drift one bit of evidence comes from an exotic branch of geophysics known as paleomagnetism the study of magnetic lines of force in ancient rocks it was discovered that the lines of force frozen into continental rocks at the time of their crystallization are all askew with reference to the present position of the north and south poles continents must once have been oriented to the poles very differently and the recent discovery of a soft layer in the upper mantle supplied a plausible medium upon which the continents might be drifting but the strongest evidence was again provided by the discovery of the mid ocean system of ridges and rifts which fitted into the theory of continental drift in either of two ways if the earth is expanding as the mid ocean rifts seemed to indicate then this expansion is what caused the original splitting up of the continents and their apparent drifting apart like patterns on the surface of an expanding balloon on the other hand if the earth is not expanding as some still maintain then the rifts could support the theory of drift in another way they could well be the vents through which huge internal heat currents or convection cells circular rolling currents like those seen in boiling liquids reached the earth s surface pushing up mantle material forcing a plastic flow of light materials to the underside of continents causing the continents to drift and compressing them horizontally to form the wrinkled folds of mountains and set off earthquakes what precise mechanism could thus cause the heavy enormously thick and solid materials of the earth to flow egon orowan a solid state physicist at m i t has recently investigated the matter using polycrystalline alumina to simulate the materials in the upper mantle and crust he concludes that convection heat currents in the crystalline mantle could induce a type of slow plastic movement known as hot creep a sliding of crystals on one another which as strains accumulate in the rock structure could cause creep fractures wrinkling and earthquakes by various calculations he concludes that the u s and the whole western atlantic are creeping or drifting westward into the pacific at a rate of about one centimeter per year there are still many objections to these upsetting new theories the drift hypothesis for instance would require that a huge section of the earth s crust between rift valleys be moving inexorably in one direction tending to open the rift on one side of a continent and to close the rift on another side actually however the rifts appear to be opening on all sides of every continent and the expansion theory has been challenged by two u s geological survey physicists who performed a modern version of the amazingly accurate measurement of the radius of the earth made by eratosthenes about b c and found that the radius has not varied by more than a few miles in the last million years meanwhile a fourth theory has come to the fore it holds that the earth is neither expanding nor contracting but is essentially stable and solid all the way down to its core this theory centers around the teachings of britain s great old master geophysicist sir harold jeffreys who maintains that the earth is much too solid rigid and strong to allow such mass movements in its crust and convection currents in its mantle as continental drift would imply in this view continents were formed in the molten stage by upward segregation of lighter materials like slag rising to the top of a molten ingot of steel and they remain frozen and embedded in the now solid mantle indeed according to a famous computation by lord kelvin the mantle has about double the rigidity of steel hence except for some local fluidities the earth is not plastic but essentially elastic like steel this concept of the earth was startlingly confirmed in from a totally unexpected quarter space observations of the irregular orbits of space satellites which reflected a highly variable gravitational pull from the earth over large areas led to two important though still controversial discoveries one was that the earth is slightly pear d bulging more below the equator than above small as this f regularity is it causes the earth to depart so far from being a perfect oblate spheroid that it apparently exceeds the calculated strength of its own materials the second discovery was that there are extensive irregularities in gravity over the earth like great shallow hills and bowls eight major gravity anomalies have been located the two greatest being a deep depression or bowl off the tip of india and a great hill or rise in the new guinea area the gravity hills being areas of great strain in the earth s mass appear to coincide with the greatest earthquake zones to sustain such gross irregularities in shape and mass without breaking apart the earth must be exceedingly rigid and strong the strains generated by these anomalies according to space geodesists must go down to the very core of the earth they are so great that to account for them some have refurbished the theory first suggested by george darwin that a great catastrophe once tore a huge mass out of what is now the pacific ocean to form the moon and perhaps mars a more plausible hypothesis suggested by gordon j f macdonald of the university of california at los angeles is that the deep strains are caused by a ten million year lag in the adjustment of the earth s shape to its declining rate of rotation this lag stores vast tension or energy in the earth like a coiled spring accounting for all the shifts in its crust including earthquakes in this clash of theories science progresses and when the din is at its highest the greatest advances may be expected often through a melding of conflicting viewpoints for instance walter m elsasser of princeton university now suggests that all changes or movements in the earth of any significance are confined to a thin surface layer only to miles deep which would leave the bulk of the earth relatively stable strong and solid while allowing some form of drift or mobility in the upper layer in any event most geophysicists believe that it will be only a matter of a few years before many of the key issues are decided closing in on earthquakes while this broad inquiry into fundamentals goes forward without which earthquakes would never be fully understood geophysicists are also bent upon a closer more practical study of individual earthquakes themselves much remains to be learned about the character and pattern of their activity with an eye to prediction volcanologists have reached a good rate of success in predicting eruptions by studying specific volcanoes over long periods and for a decade the u s coast and geodetic survey has operated a tsunami warning system out of honolulu by checking special tide gauges dotted around the mid pacific it is able to predict the arrival time on shorelines of the giant mile per hour sea waves generated by oceanic earthquakes coast and geodetic is now extending the system to alaska and is also seeking a way to predict by computer analysis not only arrival times but also wave heights the earthquake problem is much more difficult but it too may yield to an organized effort a number of hopeful lines of research open out one is the study of the foreshocks and aftershocks of big earthquakes to see whether they reveal a warning pattern for years the japanese and others have tried this without much success but a few broad hints have emerged for one the japanese found that big quakes generally followed a counterclockwise course around the rim of the pacific more recently accurate location of earthquakes in depth has revealed a fairly regular pattern of quakes moving up and down major faults today more comprehensive computer analysis of small earthquakes is available from a worldwide network of seismographic stations operated by u s coast and geodetic and the hope is that more significant patterns will emerge a still more promising line of research untried on any big scale as yet is the burying of strain tilt and displacement gauges broadside over a major earthquake area observations of the buildup of strain or tilt in underlying rock formations may reveal a warning pattern as strain reaches the breaking point and an earthquake occurs dr frank press chairman of the special national advisory panel on earthquake prediction and director of california institute of technology s seismological laboratory has a grant from the national science foundation to try such an instrumented experiment in the great san andreas fault area around san francisco the san andreas fault is a huge steadily moving fracture slanting down the state from a point miles north of san francisco nearly to the mexican border measurements show that one side of the fault is moving in relation to the other at a rate of about two inches a year when the strain reaches a critical point another big quake will occur the area may be almost due for one other clues are worth pursuing an oil prospecting magnetometer registered a curious shift in field just prior to alaska s good friday quake hinting that magnetic fields may have some relation to earthquakes something might be learned from the study of microseisms or tiny earth tremors which are little understood though they show up in all seismograms the great difficulty in such lines of investigation is to distinguish anything significant against the background of constant minor shiverings or rumblings in the earth including the hundreds of major to minor earthquakes occurring somewhere in the world every day obviously it will take long and patient observation to begin to see a pattern upon which to base predictions building to withstand them pending the discovery of a method of forecasting earthquakes however many practical measures can be taken to lessen the damage from them the first is the careful zoning of active earthquake areas based on geological foundation studies and the enforcement of codes prescribing what may be built and where one of the most damaged districts in anchorage was a new residential area where landslides and shearing action turned most of the homes into matchwood only five years before a u s geological survey report warned that the soil in that region was unreliable most of alaska s towns are built on similarly unconsolidated silty or clayey coastal soils dangerously subject to slides only strong shoring drainage and soil conditioning can reduce the risks on such shaky ground similar dangerous ground conditions exist elsewhere around boston in the puget sound area and all up and down the california coast one smart residential district just below san francisco s telegraph hill has been built on filled and that is liable to slide away in any major quake and other developments are mushrooming on shoreline landfills bulldozed hillsides and other questionable areas posing a danger for the future real estate developers have resisted clear earthquake zoning so strenuously in the past that to date no detailed u s zoning map is available much also remains to be done about the building of earthquake proof structures beyond providing the lateral bracing and reinforced walls prescribed in most quake areas even in california where the strictest building code has been in effect only since the law has grown lax and inadequate under the pressures of burgeoning population and real estate development last year however los angeles passed a new city ordinance requiring all major new buildings to install strong motion seismographs patterned on a new u s coast and geodetic instrument to study the motion of the buildings under tremors and to gather data for improving future design through such studies and the mounting effort to understand and predict earthquakes this old earthly affliction may yet lose some of its horrors more from the fortune com

house energy and commerce committee thursday hayward s inability or unwillingness to answer a number of direct questions about the decision making that preceded the spill cost him many of his job responsibilities today together with a good deal of his erstwhile cheering section in the british press the times of london didn t go easy on the oil executive summing up its analysis of his performance in washington with the headline from mr bean to mr has been for bp s tony hayward the times giles whittell wrote that hayward had a chance to save his career and the good name of his company by giving forthright detailed answers to highly specific questions submitted in advance by two of the most astute and enlightened men in congress instead hayward he wrote seemed to have prepared by taking beta blockers whittell argued that hayward stonewalled congressional interrogators despite the executive s claims to the contrary the guardian clearly agreed with that assessment in its own piece on the hearing bp oil spill tony hayward stonewalls congress although hayward was carefully coached by legal and media teams and was testifying under oath the guardian noted he failed to satisfy also according to the guardian hayward delivered his answers in flat impassive tones in the telegraph pr branding specialist mark borkowski wrote that hayward s communication skills didn t rival those of a tax inspector the new age demands a front and centre spokesman who can make the audience feel like he is listening and actually gives a damn borkowski wrote but tony hayward doesn t seem to have learned a great deal about being inclusive about engaging with the public accused of stonewalling he stonewalled borkowski continued he couldn t or wouldn t answer most of the questions in fact he looked like a tired undertaker who was rather bored with having to look mournful photos haunting images of the oil disaster still other british commentators had plenty of rancor left for the united states and its political leaders rupert cornwell a columnist for the independent added to the criticism that others in the british press have leveled against the obama administration and congress that they re unfairly piling on bp even as the company tries to clean up its mess cornwell wrote that yesterday s grilling of mr hayward is a century version of the medieval stocks public disgrace for the public villain of the moment while cornwell harkened back to medieval times to describe hayward s treatment on capitol hill the daily mail went back even further for a historical comparison the british paper reported that hayward was subjected to a grilling so savage yesterday it was more like ancient rome than capitol hill wave after wave of criticism flew the way of the

by its faith in free markets and neo liberal trade policies the economist came out in support not just of a british company but of business itself which it judged to be unfairly maligned in the spill fiasco america s justifiable fury with bp is degenerating into a broader attack on business the economist s editors wrote in today s lead editorial the economist expressed concern that business leaders who are already gloomy depressed by the economy and nervous of their president s attitude towards them will likely not be encouraged by the treatment of bp because obama s now pushing firms

getting a second wind factories boosted their output in october by the most since july the federal reserve said tuesday its report follows several other positive readings on the economy including data released monday that showed retail sales rose in october by the most in seven months after a pretty disappointing summer the economic recovery might be picking up said paul ashworth an economist at capital economics and a report tuesday on wholesale prices showed that the rising production and sales aren t increasing prices enough to fan inflation fears that gives the federal reserve leeway to carry out its billion bond purchase plan to try to lower interest rates and spur growth the fed s bond purchase plan has sparked criticism from some economists who say it risks triggering runaway inflation later on but several analysts said tuesday s tame wholesale price report provides support for the fed s move the incoming data suggests at least for now that the fed was justified in its decision said diane swonk chief economist at mesirow financial manufacturers boosted their production by percent in october the fed said the gain was led by increased output of long lasting goods such as autos appliances and business equipment overall industrial production was unchanged last month but only because of a drop in utilities output as unusually warm weather reduced demand for heating economists welcomed the increase in factory production as a sign that business and consumer spending is growing at a sustainable if still modest pace wholesale prices rose in october the fourth straight monthly increase the gain was due mainly to higher gas costs and there was no sign of significant inflation as the costs of food cars and computers all fell the producer price index rose percent the labor department said the index has risen percent over the past months but excluding the volatile food and energy categories the core index fell by percent that was the sharpest drop in more than four years the decline was driven by falling prices for new cars and trucks the report measures prices pressures before they reach the consumer it showed that companies have little ability to pass on the higher costs they re paying for grains and other commodities food prices fell slightly confounding expectations that they d rise because of higher prices for corn soybeans and sugar excluding the drop in auto prices the core index rose by percent economists said the core index has risen just percent over the past months with prices largely in check the fed said earlier this month that it will buy billion in government bonds over the next eight months to try to lower longer term interest rates the idea is that lower rates could lift stock prices as investors shift money out of low yielding bonds and into stocks higher stock prices would make people feel wealthier and more willing to spend and if business leaders become more confident as their personal wealth rises they re more likely to hire and expand once they do the economy would strengthen when it announced the program the fed said measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low compared to levels it considers consistent with price stability car prices fell a seasonally adjusted percent in october the department said and pickup truck prices fell percent both were the biggest drops in about four years the department incorporates the price impact of the new model cars that automakers introduce each year in the october index new car prices rose last month but by less than in previous years under the department s seasonal adjustment process that translates into lower prices consumers responded by buying cars at the healthiest pace since the cash for clunkers program in august sales at auto dealerships rose percent in october grain prices rose last month but food companies aren t passing on the full price increases to consumers corn prices rose percent and soybeans percent but beef and veal costs which can rise when feed grains are more expensive fell percent the labor department said agricultural commodity prices have given back some of their gains in recent weeks corn has fallen nearly percent so far in november though it s still up percent this year wheat has fallen nearly percent this month but remains up percent since january with unemployment high and the economy weak retailers won t risk chasing away frugal shoppers by raising prices that could change in coming months if corn and other grain prices remain high or resume rising said jonathan basile an economist at credit suisse food manufacturers may not be able to keep absorbing the extra costs last week sara lee corp said rising commodity prices cut into its first quarter profits which fell percent the

shape because of president barack obama s sweeping health care overhaul and will stay afloat a dozen years longer than earlier projected trustees forecast thursday but that depends on cuts in care that the system s top analyst says are highly doubtful the annual report by the trustees who oversee medicare and social security led by treasury secretary timothy geithner gives backers of the new health care law evidence of a positive impact on government entitlement programs but it also undercuts the findings with a host of caveats in what amounted to a dissenting opinion top medicare actuary richard foster warned that the report s financial projections do not represent a reasonable expectation for the hospital fund for america s elderly kathleen sebelius secretary of health and human services and one of the trustees said they were required to assume current law in making their projections including a cut in medicare payments to doctors she too doubted the cuts would ever happen which is why we continue to provide cautionary notes in the report the trustees projected the medicare hospital trust fund would be exhausted in or years later than estimated last year the news wasn t as rosy for social security which will pay out more in benefits than it collects in taxes for the first time in decades this year and next year the social security trust funds are expected to be exhausted in the same date as in last year s report more bad news for social security recipients the trustees project no cost of living increase for social security recipients next year the second year in a row with no increase the adjustments are based on inflation the administration delayed the trustees report which normally comes out in the spring in order to recalculate projected spending estimates based on changes in the new health care law geithner said that while the report showed very positive developments from the new health care law it also underscored that we must continue to make progress addressing the financing challenges facing both medicare and social security those reforms require that we achieve very substantial improvements in efficiency and productivity he said foster the medicare official said in a statement included in the report that the program s projected savings might not be realistic the short run projections by his office were similar to those of the trustees estimating that the medicare trust fund would be exhausted in one year earlier however by government actuaries see medicare costs growing to more than percent of the economy compared with percent now the trustees assume medicare will consume only percent of the nation s economy in a difference that amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars the nonpartisan experts said there are two big reasons for their estimate of higher costs the trustees report assumes that doctors will absorb a percent cut in medicare payments over the next three years the cuts are called for under current law but are routinely waived by congress because too many doctors would stop seeing medicare patients projected savings in the new health care law from cuts to hospitals nursing home and other institutional providers will prove to be politically unsustainable in the long run for these reasons the financial projections shown in this report for medicare do not represent a reasonable expectation for actual program operations in either the short range or the long range foster said some supporters of the health care overhaul said foster had embraced a glass half empty approach i think that he raises an important point but he s too pessimistic said robert greenstein head of the center on budget and policy priorities which advocates for the poor john rother executive vice president of aarp said it may not be known for years whether the law will generate the kind of savings anticipated on the trustees report the purpose of the law was to slow the growth in health care costs rother said but he added the fact is we really won t know until some of the regulations get spelled out the trustees said social security s finances have been hurt by the poor economy but the effects have been partly offset by the health care overhaul the actuaries assume the law will slow the growth of insurance costs enabling employers to shift more compensation to wages that would increase revenue from the payroll taxes that support social security in the short run however the recession is hurting revenues for the retirement and disability program for the first time since the social security will pay out more money in benefits this year and next year than it collects in payroll taxes the program will post surpluses for a few years after that before returning to permanent deficits in unless congress acts the social security trust funds are expected to be exhausted in at that point social security will collect enough in payroll taxes money to cover about three fourths of the benefits owed the fact that the costs for the program will likely exceed tax revenue this year is not a cause for panic but it does send a strong message that it s time for us to make the tough choices that we know we need to make social security commissioner michael j astrue said obama has formed a bipartisan fiscal commission that is working on recommendations to improve government finances including those for social security its recommendations are due in december more than million people receive social security retirement benefits average a month while disabled workers get an average of social security is financed by a percent payroll tax on wages below the tax is paid by workers and matched by employers the social security trust funds have built up a trillion surplus over

providence ended the past year with a surplus and it s great that as a result the city can pay down a cumulative deficit from the years when money ran short but before we start celebrating it s important to put the numbers in perspective the city still faces massive financial problems that if left unsolved will drive it into bankruptcy a large chunk of the million surplus reported last week by mayor jorge elorza million was expected when the city council adopted last year s budget it was expected because city officials built a million surplus into the budget with the express goal of having that money at the end of the fiscal year to help pay down the cumulative deficit if we think of a surplus as money that was not expected it would be more accurate to say that the city ended the past fiscal year with a million surplus that s still good news but again some perspective is needed the elorza administration realized a surplus by doing a good job of managing medical costs and it oversaw increased collections on taxes and inspection and building fees but the city also saved money by avoiding certain expenses including those for police and firefighter academies and the costs that would have followed as new firefighters and police officers were hired with openings to fill the city won t be able to do that again in this fiscal year there is also the possibility that the city will have to pay firefighters to compensate them for what they claim is some million in lost overtime that resulted after mr elorza reorganized the fire department shifting it from four platoons down to three so even as the city has budgeted for the current year an expected surplus of million with the aim of paying off what remains of the cumulative deficit and putting the first of what will hopefully be many contributions into a new rainy day fund providence s fiscal challenges remain the biggest nightmare of course is the billion unfunded liability the city faces for retiree pensions and health benefits against that number the surplus is a mere drop in the bucket by all means mr elorza and his administration should continue to keep close tabs on the budget and reduce costs while maintaining the services residents and businesses need but city leaders also must tackle the big picture challenges reducing retiree and personnel costs negotiating larger contributions from major nonprofits in lieu of the property taxes they don t pay repairing crumbling school buildings and reforming education to help all young people reach their full potential city leaders should also strive to reduce property tax rates providence in had the fourth highest commercial property tax in a survey of cities trailing only chicago new york and detroit according to a report issued last year by the

panel s painful budget draws challengesbyline by andrew taylor and tom raum associated presstime hr mins ago washington a painful package of spending cuts and tax increases drew sharp challenges from both the left and right on president barack obama s deficit commission wednesday putting approval in doubt however both parties senate budget point men embraced the plan and even opponents called it a starting point for efforts next year to control the nation s ballooning debt it s a template that gives people an opportunity to start discussing what we have to do to get our fiscal house in order said rep xavier becerra a california democrat on the panel who hasn t said whether he ll support the package the member bipartisan commission scheduled a vote on the plan for friday but as wednesday s meeting demonstrated the co chairmen democrat erskine bowles and republican alan simpson face a difficult chore in rounding up the votes needed to officially send the plan to congress for consideration winning over lawmakers who are also panel members appeared to be the biggest remaining challenge given the politically incendiary nature of many of the proposals the tax increases it includes are deal breakers for some republicans likewise social program cuts for some democrats the plan calls for sweeping tax changes that would affect millions of americans including trimming or doing away with many popular tax breaks such as the home mortgage deduction it would also make deep cuts in military spending slash the federal work force raise the retirement age for full social security benefits and make cuts in medicare it aims to reduce federal red ink by nearly trillion within a decade although prospects for the plan are unclear the attention it has received has helped awaken the nation to the depth of the economic hole the country is in and the need for bold action to dig out suggested bowles who was former president bill clinton s white house chief of staff simpson is a former republican senator from wyoming the american people get it now people want this to happen bowles said while the deficit commission grappled with longer term economic woes congressional democrats and republicans worked separately to strike a deal with the white house on a more immediate financial issue extending bush era tax cuts that expire dec and despite talk of finding common ground neither side seemed willing to yield much as negotiations began with treasury secretary timothy geithner and budget director jacob lew both democrats and republicans seem willing to extend most of the tax cuts but democrats want to let cuts for the wealthiest americans expire citing damage to the federal deficit from lost revenue as a main argument meanwhile as the deficit commission formally the president s national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform began moving toward a final decision sens kent conrad and judd gregg the democratic chairman and top republican on the senate budget committee threw their high voltage support behind the plan still both expressed some misgivings gregg the new hampshire republican who is retiring from the senate took issue with some proposed tax hikes in the plan sounding a familiar gop theme that taxes should be lower not higher to promote growth still he said the overall plan was moving dramatically in the right direction conrad d n d said there were things in this plan that i dislike intensely yet he said he was prepared to support it and support it strongly i don t see another alternative they were joined in supporting the package by panel members alice rivlin white house budget director in the clinton administration david cote ceo of honeywell international and ann fudge a former chief executive of young rubicam this is the framework for us to move forward fudge said counting simpson and bowles that put seven of the panel s members on the record in support for the proposal house budget committee chairman john spratt jr d s c who lost a re election race last month said he s leaning toward supporting it and sen tom coburn r okla seemed to lean in favor as well but rep jan schakowsky a liberal democrat from illinois told the panel she could not support the plan contending it proposed disproportionate cuts in social programs particularly federal help for seniors she said it should have paved the way toward a more robust social security rep paul ryan r wis a sponsor of a competing deficit reduction plan signaled that he would likely oppose the proposal saying it doesn t sufficiently fix the health care problem ryan who is expected to chair the house budget committee next year said the plan envisions going forward with obama s health care overhaul law and would raise taxes by a total of trillion over the next decade rep jeb hensarling r texas also seemed to imply he could not support the plan citing concerns about higher taxes bowles and simpson have acknowledged it will be hard to assemble the votes needed to give the deficit reduction plan a direct ticket to congressional consideration but they and other commission members have noted that congress can still take up the ideas white house spokesman robert gibbs said the commission s recommendations would be evaluated as the administration puts together its budget for next year he declined to comment on the mixed statements at wednesday s session saying let me not get too far out on the commission until they ve had a chance to complete their work republicans generally complain about tax increases and the trimming of popular tax breaks like the home mortgage deduction meanwhile democrats have cried out the loudest over proposed cuts in social programs including raising the social security retirement age and cuts to medicare bowles and simpson who floated a preliminary version of their plan three weeks ago put forth a revised page proposal on wednesday that they titled the moment of truth to attract democrats there s now an exemption from the higher social security age the plan would raise the normal retirement age to by and by for people who perform physical labor spending cuts for agency budgets would be accelerated in an attempt to win over gop sens coburn of oklahoma and mike crapo of idaho also in a sweetener for some of the tough medicine bowles and simpson said that to help economic recovery congress should consider a temporary payroll tax holiday in that would allow workers to forgo paying social security taxes for a year the report said that while this would cost billion to billion in lost revenue it would result in significant short term economic growth and job creation proposed cuts in payments to hospitals that serve more medicaid patients were dropped while cuts to agriculture subsidies were scaled back sharply to attract the vote of conrad tax breaks like the earned income tax credit and the deduction for charitable contributions were added back the plan includes major health care belt tightening biting deeper than the cost control measures in obama s overhaul law for the first time the government would set and enforce an overall budget for federal health care programs that cover more than million people from alzheimer s patients in nursing homes to premature babies in hospital intensive care workers with solid coverage on the job drug

during that period under all programs the data covered the survey week for the government s employment report for november but weekly claims have been too volatile to provide a good prediction of nonfarm payrolls analysts comments cary leahey economist decision economics new york you continue to get a downward move in the smooth forward moving average you had a stable number in the most current week the forward moving average is down in the payroll employment survey week for november compared to october so you are basically looking at the same kind of tone to the labor market in november to october october was reasonably good so i think most analysts will look at this report and think you are going to get another triple digit gain in payrolls maybe some offsets because of the very weak municipal sector but we will see an okay kind of november jobs report the difficulty you have with at the moment is that the fed can certainly find justification in yesterday s unchanged core inflation readings that deflation is still a serious bugaboo and they want to push up inflation rate to percent over time you can look at today s data positively for bonds as the improvement has leveled off at around or you could look at the opposite approach that the trend is still quite favorable moving into december so i don t think you can trade it strongly one way or another nick kalivas analyst at mf global in chicago it s showing some hope that there is a recovery in labor demand it is on the lower side from what we ve been seeing and maybe that is generating some optimism that we will see another positive payrolls number fred dickson chief market strategist the davidson cos in lake oswego oregon i look at it and say the trend is down and this basically suggests we probably should be looking at another decent employment report in december i think that would be looked at in a favorable light the jobless news today is going to be secondary to gm and ireland in terms of market moving but the trend is encouraging john canally investment strategist lpl financial boston based on the four week moving average monthly job creation is above at maybe even double dip

to make much of any one week s movement but i think why this number might matter a little more is that this number actually captures the survey week of the payrolls report on the face of it this would

meantime consumers should explore all of their health insurance options including private individual and family plans since it can take some time to compare options and receive a coverage decision on an individual or family health insurance application ehealthinsurance recommends that consumers who may not be able to afford cobra without the subsidy begin their search for alternatives now question i stop working in february but i m not sure i m technically laid off until after february how can i find out if i will qualify for the cobra subsidy answer your last day of work and your termination date may not coincide if you stop working in february for example but are being paid for vacation time that keeps you on the company s books into march you may not qualify for the subsidy talk to your human resources representative or benefits administrator to learn your exact termination date if it falls on or prior to february you may qualify for the cobra subsidy question cobra coverage without the subsidy will be too expensive for me do i have other options answer if you are not eligible for group health insurance through a spouse s plan consider purchasing an individual or family health insurance plan on your own depending on the state in which you live you may be able to find private health insurance coverage at a monthly premium less expensive than even subsidized cobra according to the kaiser family foundation the average cost of a subsidized cobra policy would be per month for a family and for an individual by contrast a survey of ehealthinsurance customers showed that half of all family health insurance policyholders paid less than per month and half of all individual health insurance policyholders paid less than in monthly premiums if you expect to receive employer sponsored health insurance again within six months or less and only want coverage to protect you in case of unexpected accident or injury you may also wish to consider short term health insurance question what if i have a pre existing medical condition or can t afford to buy coverage on my own answer since it is possible in most states to be declined for private coverage based on pre existing medical conditions it s important that you consider your options carefully you cannot be turned down for cobra coverage based on medical history therefore if you have a pre existing medical condition and can afford cobra please enroll if only one of your family members has a pre existing medical condition you may wish to consider enrolling that person in cobra while covering others through

approved for a privately purchased health insurance plan and then find that the cobra subsidy eligibility period is extended you may drop your individual or family plan in favor of cobra as long as you are still within your cobra enrollment period usually days from termination of employment keep in mind however that when applying for private health insurance some carriers may charge you an application fee usually no more than which may not be refundable when searching for plans on ehealthinsurance com you will be able to quickly identify which plans require application fees please also note that cobra coverage is not designed to provide a permanent health insurance solution as the law is currently written the cobra subsidy only provides months of assistance and your overall

votes on middle class tax cutsbyline by stephen ohlemacher associated presstime fri nov am et washington after meeting with president barack obama thursday democratic leaders in congress said they plan to hold a series of politically charged votes to extend middle class tax cuts while letting tax cuts for the wealthy expire republicans are expected to block the plan leaving both sides back at square one as they try to negotiate a deal to spare families at every income level from a big tax increase in january democratic officials said obama did not embrace a particular approach to the tax cuts in his oval office meeting with democratic leaders he indicated he wanted to wait for a meeting with democratic and republican leaders on nov before staking out a position i think there s a reality here which is that while it might be best to continue the middle class tax cuts and raise taxes on higher income people the votes are not there to do that said sen joseph lieberman a connecticut independent who caucuses with the democrats i think everybody s got to deal with a stark reality which is are we going to leave here knowing that we haven t come to an agreement and that everybody s taxes are going to go up jan senate majority leader harry reid d nev said he would like to schedule competing votes on the senate floor one would be on senate republican leader mitch mcconnell s bill to make all the tax cuts permanent the other would be on a democratic plan to extend only the middle class tax cuts neither is expected to pass house speaker nancy pelosi said she plans to hold a similar vote on extending the middle class tax cuts in early december we re united in recognizing we have to protect the middle class reid said of senate democrats mcconnell said votes structured for symbolic reasons in december won t prevent a tax hike in january it s not enough to talk about the problem of the looming tax hike on families and hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the country we have to fix it obama and democratic leaders in congress want to extend the tax cuts for individuals making less than and married couples making less than republicans and a growing number of rank and file democrats want to extend them all after congressional elections in which republicans won control of the house and gained seats in the senate obama signaled a willingness to compromise with republicans but democrats are struggling to come up with a unified position congress returned this week for a lame duck session in which democrats still have majorities in both the house and senate however they will need republican support to get the votes necessary to pass a tax bill in the senate democratic leaders left their white house meeting with obama thursday without a game plan for negotiating with republicans later senate democrats met behind closed doors for more than two hours but didn t agree on a strategy beyond trying to prevent a tax increase for the middle class most think that it makes sense to maintain the tax cuts for those below couples below and there s a lot of discussion about all kinds of other options and there s basically no decision made said sen max baucus d mont chairman of the senate finance committee obama had invited gop leaders to the white house meeting to start laying the groundwork for a bipartisan compromise but the republicans asked to reschedule the meeting after thanksgiving republicans have been much more unified in their position most say their first choice is to make all the tax cuts permanent some have said they are open to a temporary extension of all the tax cuts while some in congress have a strange desire to raise taxes on hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the country

traveler program would come in designating some passengers as low risk based on information such as a background check employment history lack of criminal record and other factors once travelers enroll in the program and their identity is confirmed at the airport with the help of biometric information they would be subject to less security ridge said the program should be extended to

stood its ground thursday and refused to be swayed by the federal reserve s decision to launch a bond buying program to create new dollars and shore up the u s economic recovery the ecb as expected left its benchmark refinancing rate at a record low percent for the straight month it appeared to remain on track to unwinding its own post crisis programs even though unemployment across the countries that use the euro is percent higher than the u s rate high unemployment and tepid growth are reasons the fed has decided to ease monetary policy further while the fed is pumping more money into the u s economy partly to get growth higher and unemployment heading downwards the ecb is pursuing a seemingly opposite path its president jean claude trichet gave no new details on the future of its crisis lending measures but indicated that the ecb will give an update next month he underlined his longstanding insistence that the ecb s measures such as providing unlimited liquidity to banks and buying government bonds are by definition of a transitory nature the main reasons behind the ecb s stance are that inflation at percent is at its target of close to but below percent and economic growth has outstripped much more gloomy predictions earlier this year when the greek debt crisis was in full swing still the eurozone faces a number of problems hence trichet s insistence thursday that the risks to the economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside with uncertainty prevailing there were plenty of reminders thursday that the problems that led to the bailout of greece and serious questions over the future of the euro currency itself haven t disappeared ireland is at the epicenter of investors concerns at the moment as the government prepares to introduce another dose of austerity more spending cuts and tax increases to get its public finances into shape meanwhile the euro rose to a new month high to the likely concern of exporters and trichet aired his concerns that planned reforms to the rules underpinning the euro don t go far enough the backdrop to thursday s ecb meeting was the fed s confirmation wednesday that it will buy billion of long term government bonds by mid in an attempt to further drive down rates on mortgages and other debt in the hope of getting lending higher that will be in addition to an expected billion to billion in purchases over the same period from reinvesting proceeds from the fed s mortgage portfolio trichet turned aside questions about the fed s action noting that the two central banks have different mandates while the ecb has an inflation target the fed has a broader mandate that emphasizes both controlling inflation and monitoring growth levels we have our responsibility we have our mandate trichet said we have delivered price stability for million citizens trichet said he had no further comments on what is done by other central banks that have their own responsibility their own environment trichet who last month voiced concern about excess volatility in exchange rates said thursday that he trusts u s statements of support for a strong dollar although the dollar fell two cents against the euro after wednesday s fed announcement developing countries in asia and latin america have complained the united states appears to be trying to devalue its currency which would give it a trade advantage trichet seems to be one of the few people maybe the only one in the world to still believe in the u s administration s strong dollar policy said carsten brzeski an economist at ing in brussels the prospect of more dollars in the system has led many investors to believe that the u s is operating a policy of benign neglect toward the value of its currency as a lower dollar will boost exports and lift growth by late afternoon london time the euro was trading percent higher on the day at shy of its earlier high of the ecb has clearly no intention to follow the fed or other central banks with further stimulus brzeski said he argued that the ecb s next move likely will be to end unlimited allotments of short term credit to banks in three month lending operations though that may not happen until after next year s first quarter in the past brzeski noted trichet frequently remarked that central banks are a very impressive brotherhood of mutual admiration but that appears to have changed this brotherhood has not been broken up but its two most important members are now going their separate ways said brzeski\n", ["T2"]], ["red cross moving supplies and

regulatory or enforcement powers but a failure by metro to comply with its recommendations could cause federal and state governments to curtail the transit agency s funding the board wields similar influence over transit agencies around the country richard sarles the interim general manager of the washington metropolitan area transit authority said the ntsb s recommendations were tough but necessary however he said this does not get changed overnight the ntsb faulted metro s board of directors for failing to actively monitor safety issues the track signaling system failed to recognize trains times a week but the issue was deemed a minor nuisance the ntsb said in opening remarks hersman said the fort totten station crash was not the first time metro s safety system was compromised previous accidents some of which killed employees foreshadowed the deadlier crash you are going to hear a lot about wmata s anemic safety culture today hersman said later she added because the necessary preventive measures were not taken the only question was when would metro have another accident and of what magnitude kenneth hawkins whose brother dennis was killed in the crash said he was pleased by the strength of the ntsb s recommendations but because the board lacks regulatory power he wasn t expecting much change it s not going to change our lives he said the damage has been done to us sen barbara mikulski d md described the ntsb s findings as both chilling and very sad she called on metro to fully implement the recommendations and said congress should authorize the u s department of transportation to establish and enforce safety standards for transit systems if metro s track circuits simple electronic devices meant to detect stopped trains on the tracks had been working properly the approaching train would have been slowed automatically instead the approaching train continued to travel at mph until the operator saw the train ahead of her she pulled the emergency brake but was still traveling at more than mph at the moment of the collision ntsb staff member ruben payan said metro had been aware that the track circuits were known to fail five days before the accident technicians tested the circuit that malfunctioned but used an old test that didn t detect the failure an up to date test payan said likely would have caught the problem metro says it now tests circuits twice a day has stopped mixing train control components from different manufacturers and established a new test to find circuits susceptible to problems immediately after the crash metro switched to manual operation of trains instead of automatic a change that remains in effect this was not metro s only deadly accident in recent years two metro workers were crushed to death on tracks in january when a maintenance truck backed into them last year two more metro workers were killed in separate incidents there was also a close call in december when several independent

scheme has led a key senate committee publicly to express grave concern about what it considers the widespread failure of the programme the panel regards the pledging project as the worst government policy for years and one that is taking the country down the road to economic collapse as it risks sinking under the burden of public debt the senate s committee on economics commerce and industry yesterday held a news conference on its study titled the truth on the government s rice pledging scheme does it really benefit farmers the committee presented eight points of failure in the scheme and called for the government urgently to review it to save the country from further huge losses the panel will also submit its study on the pledging scheme which is part of the government s broader populist policy for debate in the upper house as well as passing it to the national anti corruption commission the election commission and the office of the auditor general calling for an investigation into the alleged failure of the pledging project committee chairman maharnnop dejvitak said the crop pledging scheme was the worst policy introduced by any government since it has not only created huge budgetary losses but farmers the intended beneficiaries have not enjoyed any meaningful benefits from the programme he said adding that only some groups of traders and politicians had made gains as a result of loopholes in the scheme the committee does not agree with the government s populist policy which has led to short term benefit rather than promoting sustainable growth this half political half economic policy has had a huge impact on the country s macroeconomy and will result in massive public debt which could mean thailand becomes another greece in the future maharnnop said if the government continues with the measure it could push the national public debt to more than per cent of gross domestic product in the next decade he warned according to a thailand development research institute study the rice pledging programme will increase public debt by an average of per cent per annum senator wanchai sornsiri said the failure of the pledging policy should be debated and widely acknowledged by the public and involved sectors the project has led to corruption and huge losses from its inception through to the end of the rice release process he said poor farmers were the major losers as they had not benefited from the pledging despite what the government had promised while traders unscrupulous officials and politicians had enjoyed extensive benefits from pledging and corruption to save the kingdom from racking up even more massive losses from the policy the senate panel suggested a number of measures to the government first it must review and change the policy by reducing the pledging price limiting the volume of pledged rice and focusing the project on small farmers it should also take serious measures to suppress corruption inherent in the scheme the government should also restrict rice field landlords from participating in pledging inform the public clearly about its government to government rice deals to ensure transparency and draw up a sustainable plan to promote the farming sector and boost farmers incomes the committee also pointed out eight weak points of the rice pledging policy as voiced by academics and the private sector the main criticisms are as follows lcontinuation of the unlimited rice pledging policy would mean losses of billion baht us billion for the country by the end of next year from the current level of billion baht lpledging has created huge losses for thai rice exporters to the tune of billion baht a year lmost medium sized and rich farmers have benefited from the pledging while poor smaller farmers have not really gained from the measure lthe government would lose more than billion baht if it sold million tonnes of pledged rice at the market price lthe quality of thai rice continues to suffer because the pledging policy is focused only on price and does not promote rice quality development us baht\n", ["T2"]], ["protesters take to athens streets more than greeks took to

generation rover to the surface of mars which is already overbudget and behind schedule faces significant hurdles as it races to the launch pad for a november liftoff an internal audit released wednesday found the space agency insisted the remaining work to be done will not result in yet another launch slip at this point in time we are fully on schedule said dave lavery the project s program executive at nasa headquarters the mobile mars science laboratory is intended to be the most sophisticated rover sent to the martian surface from the outset the mission managed by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory has been plagued by development woes that have put it behind schedule and driven up costs the total cost of the mission has ballooned to billion from billion nasa s inspector general faulted project managers for routinely underestimating costs and calculated that an extra million to the development budget may be needed to avoid another delay or cancellation the latest price tag may be insufficient to ensure timely completion of the project in light of the historical pattern of cost increases and the amount of work that remains to be completed the report said the size of a mini cooper and nicknamed curiosity the rover is a souped up version of the golf cart size twin rovers spirit and opportunity essentially a science laboratory on wheels curiosity carries a suite of tools to analyze martian rocks and soil to determine whether environmental conditions were ever favorable to support primitive life curiosity was supposed to fly in but problems during construction forced nasa to push back launch by two years to when the orbits of mars and earth are again closely aligned it will reach the martian surface in august engineers had to redesign the heat shield after it failed safety tests there were delays in shipping instruments to nasa it took longer than expected to build and test the gear boxes that enable the mega rover to drive and flick its robotic wrist auditors found reports of problems and failures that have not been resolved as of february since then only about issues remained though the number was a bit on the high side it was not out of the character for such a complicated mission lavery said while engineers have fixed most of the problems that delayed the launch some key issues lingered including potential contamination of rock and soil samples by the spacecraft s robotic arm nasa has since found a solution to minimize contamination but auditors said they remained concerned that the fix would not be completed in time for curiosity s departure later this month from california to florida to be prepped for launch another launch delay would increase costs by at least another million the report said nasa has maintained that curiosity is no cookie cutter rover and that unforeseen problems are to be expected when building such a complex machine unlike the previous mars rovers that bounced to a landing cocooned in air bags the nuclear powered curiosity will use a precision landing system to gently lower itself to the surface a tough engineering feat curiosity s landing site has yet to be chosen from among four finalists one thing curiosity won t be able to do is take pretty pictures of its surroundings with a high resolution d camera nasa recently nixed the camera that avatar director james cameron was helping to design because there wasn t enough time to test it before launch instead the rover s eyes will be digital color cameras that are three times more powerful than those aboard previous martian

throughout the day waves peaked in the crescent city harbor at feet around a m and in humboldt bay at feet around a m according to the national weather service surges were expected to continue overnight the tsunami warning was downgraded to an advisory by p m but officials continued to monitor the waters after the high tide hit at p m in response gov jerry brown declared a state of emergency for humboldt del norte san mateo and santa cruz counties the event hit nearly two weeks before tsunami awareness week i think everyone is plenty aware now humboldt state university geologist lori dengler said adding that the day illustrated how important natural disaster education is the fact that crescent city did a full scale evacuation drill literally a year ago i think it paid off big time the humboldt county emergency operations center was activated at approximately a m after declaring an emergency the humboldt county sheriff s office enacted a voluntary evacuation for the low lying areas of the county and recommended residents move to higher ground or inland an evacuation site was set up at redwood acres where at least people gathered before it closed shortly before p m

if they are in a hazard zone for earthquakes floods fires or tsunamis we just don t have enough safety officers to absolutely manage every aspect of the event we have to have people being sensible and making sensible decisions she said orick resident rebekah kakuk said she made sure to be prepared having heard news of the massive quake in japan on thursday night kakuk said she was packed and prepared to evacuate her home friday morning fully expecting to awaken to tsunami sirens instead she said she got calls from friends in eureka and ferndale before a m saying sirens were sounding why didn t our sirens sound she asked i m just kind of bummed that we didn t have that ear splitting noise in the morning kakuk said officials left orick residents with little to no information about where to go or what to do she said she and a neighbor drove to prairie creek redwoods state park which sits on higher ground but were turned away because the park was closed eventually she said they drove up bald hills road pulled over at a turnout and just waited i don t know what happened she said i m really bummed that in a major situation there s no information here kakuk said most residents seemed to have left town and most businesses were closed friday it s pretty quiet she said shortly after noon officials could not confirm if all sirens had gone off county administrative officer phillip smith hanes said officials will be reviewing the event for the next few days in order to analyze what worked and what could have been done differently the county has been working on establishing sirens and signs in areas that need it he said sirens are an alert device that are meant to assist people smith hanes said we have law enforcement patrol and other things that we do to back up those systems dengler said figuring out what may have gone wrong with tsunami messaging will be important there s no question that we ve learned a lot in terms of the effectiveness she said dengler said the two things people do wrong the most are flocking down to the beach to watch and unnecessarily evacuating by p m at least seven people in del norte county and oregon were swept off the beaches where they reportedly went to watch the waves when people go out of the way to put themselves in the way of the hazard that creates problems for everyone she said hundreds of residents gathered at various locations to watch the surge hit the coast from a safe perch trinidad s new city manager karen suiker said residents were out in force the whole town was out watching on the bluff there s definitely some surging boats were turning around in the harbor she said around a m a turnout off u s highway just north of airport road in mckinleyville was flooded with people by a m who

also with her friday morning tony manning ruth s boyfriend said the two had enough food and soda to stay most of the day the couple also carries a portable scanner as well as extra batteries and a radio some of those parked on the hill said they wanted to get a view of the tsunami if it hit humboldt bay eureka resident ken johnson said he took his daughter teresa to school and saw a sign indicating that there was a tsunami warning in effect and the school would be closed friday he said he decided to take her to pine hill to get a look at the bay from a safe spot and arrived to see cars parked along the hill and people standing with binoculars and cameras ready to watch the waves stir up in the bay i thought i d be the only one here he said johnson said he watched footage of the earthquake in japan and couldn t believe what he was seeing the humboldt native said he had heard of the danger to crescent city s harbor i hope people in crescent city are ok he said teresa nearly said it was the first time she s watched a tsunami event at first it was nothing but then it started to get way bigger said the grant school student it s cool to see but it s not that fast dengler said it was fortunate the morning s waves hit during low tide as the tide goes up the tsunami won t need to be big to cause a lot of damage she said back in we continued to get tsunami surges for five days in crescent city they weren t huge but they were large enough to cause some strong surges and potentially cause some problems in the harbor robert hamilton the humboldt county sheriff s office s resident deputy in shelter cove said he started seeing tsunami generated waves coming in there beginning at about a m the big waves he said started coming in the early afternoon estimating there was about feet between the low point where the tide drew out and the high point where waves smashed into the bluffs the waves drew quite an audience hamilton said adding that there where audible oohs and ahhs after every breaking wave it s turning into a huge carnival out here he said during a phone interview at about p m friday there are about people watching there s a seven piece band playing everyone just grabbed their instruments and came down it s turned into a tsunami jam session it s pretty remarkable actually hamilton said his job was to keep people safe and to ensure everyone

whole better off the result was overpromised benefits and inadequate adjustment plans and now especially in communities left behind by trade and technology fear over future prospects has created fertile soil for populist demagoguery three steps to make trade more inclusive a silver lining is that inclusivity is now at the heart of the trade agenda making trade more inclusive requires action on three broad policy fronts trade rules domestic social protection and international cooperation to complement the first two negotiate trade agreements that work for most people governments should concentrate political capital on issues in trade negotiations that deliver broad based benefits improving purchasing power is one key another lies in greater participation by small and medium sized enterprises which account for the majority of firms and jobs in any economy reducing fixed costs related to trade from complex border procedures to the regulatory burden arising from product standards and other non tariff measures would yield disproportionate gains for smaller firms done right it would not undermine product quality or consumer health and safety protections all countries not just developing economies may need to make more investments on the supply side to help smaller businesses connect to world markets domestic social policy to help those displaced by imports and machines to address the disruptions and the distributional effects of trade and technology governments need to respond across the board with investments in human capital education skills and vocational training to better match people with job opportunities active labour market policies will need to be coupled with measures to soften the blow of under or unemployment from higher minimum wages and wage top ups to universal basic incomes redistributive policy is not solely an issue for advanced economies as martin ravallion has shown for all of the progress in reducing extreme poverty the biggest income gains in developing countries have gone to the better off unless governments act effectively to expand opportunities for all they too may eventually face a backlash of frustrated ambitions cooperate internationally to support the first two objectives neither of these agendas will be cheap cooperation to curb corporate tax avoidance is one example of how governments could usefully work together at the international level to raise the revenue they need to keep citizens on board with globalization global companies with a long term view should support this agenda essential in all of this will be political honesty while reviving growth would do much to ease economic angst shoring up the fragile social license on which open markets rest requires government and business leaders to be up front with people trade like technology is good for most of us but not everyone more market opening needs to come with more redistributive social policy that has a cost and if anyone thinks it s not worth paying consider the costs of a backlash\n", ["T2"]], ["obama signs sweeping wall street overhaul into lawbyline by ross colvintime wed jul pm et washington reuters president barack obama signed into law on wednesday the most comprehensive financial regulatory overhaul since the great depression vowing to stop risky behavior on wall street that imperiled the u s economy influential business groups lined up to criticize the new law underscoring obama s uneasy relationship with america s business community some on wall street however welcomed the clarity offered by the law after months of wrangling in congress over what should be in the legislation the law which got final approval from the senate last week targets the kind of wall street risk taking that helped trigger a global financial meltdown in and also aims to strengthen consumer protections obama facing voter unrest over wall street bailouts that have failed to spark a strong main street job recovery pledged taxpayers would never again have to pump billions of dollars into failing firms to protect the economy because of this law the american people will never again be asked to foot the bill for wall street s mistakes obama said at a signing ceremony attended by some wall street bankers business leaders and lawmakers there will be no more taxpayer funded bailouts period with republicans poised to make gains in the november congressional elections obama s democrats are eager to show voters that they have taken steps to tame an industry that dragged the economy into its deepest recession in years obama and democrats have yet to gain political traction from the legislative victory with americans still anxious about a percent jobless rate and ballooning deficits the financial regulatory reforms were a major achievement for obama and his ambitious domestic agenda earlier this year he signed into law sweeping reforms of the united states trillion healthcare system the financial reforms won democrats few friends on wall street wealthy donors have started to steer more campaign contributions to republicans who voted overwhelmingly against the reforms unscrupulous lenders obama had harsh words for unscrupulous lenders and others he said had taken risks that endangered the economy he said the new law was aimed at curbing abuses and excesses on wall street and stopping taxpayer bailouts of failing companies the law would provide certainty to everybody from bankers to farmers to business owners and unless your business model depends on cutting corners or bilking your customers you have nothing to fear from this reform obama said the u s chamber of commerce an influential business group that often criticizes obama s economic policies said it would have the opposite effect such a broad sweeping bill epitomizes a law with unintended consequences that creates more uncertainty for american businesses said thomas j donohue president and ceo of the chamber the american bankers association expressed disappointment with the legislation saying it contains a tsunami of new rules and restrictions for traditional banks that had nothing to do with causing the financial crisis in the first place much of its impact will depend on how it is put into practice bart chilton a commissioner with the u s commodity futures trading commission said the law boosts transparency and gives regulators better tools to regulate markets but many questions remained to be answered this is a wide ranging bill with many facets hundreds where regulators still need to put some more meat on the bones how we do that and when we do that are questions that will really tell if this legislation meets the expectations of its supporters he said fake controversy ruth porat chief financial officer of financial giant morgan stanley which on wednesday reported higher than expected second quarter profits said the company was pleased to see the bill signed as it put some clarity around the issues the legislation targets potentially lucrative trading in risky over the counter derivatives and aims to force banks to end trading for their own profits it creates a bureau of consumer financial protection to regulate products ranging from credit cards to mortgages the administration considered this one of the most critical parts of the bill but banks fought it bitterly obama received repeated ovations during his speech and one round of applause was reserved for his praise of three republican lawmakers who broke ranks with their party to vote for the legislation the white house said citigroup inc s ceo vikram pandit bob diamond president of barclays plc and gerald hassell president of bank of new york mellon attended the bill signing jpmorgan chase co chief executive jamie

scared of the sovereign debt crisis unfolding in europe but they are ignoring a more definite and significantly larger sovereign debt catastrophe that is about to hit the world s third largest economy japan the prelude to japan s current crisis began in the early when its housing and stock market bubbles popped leading to recession for the next years using flashy names like fiscal structural reform act and emergency employment measures and policy measures of economic rebirth the government cut taxes increased spending and borrowed money to finance itself once or twice the government found fiscal religion and raised taxes however the economy stuttered and taxes again were lowered and the stimulus story continued today years into endless stimuli the japanese economy is beset by the same rot it was then except that its debt has tripled the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp stands at almost percent double those of the united states and germany and second only to zimbabwe washington should take heed because the current us course is disturbingly similar to japan s there are several key lessons from japan s decline but the most important one is this we must stop looking for government to be the source of sustainable growth population declines spell troublea country that has ballooning debt needs to have an expanding economy to help the country outgrow its debt burden economic growth is driven by two factors productivity and population growth though the japanese economy may continue to reap the benefits of productivity population growth is not in the cards japan has one of the oldest societies in the developed world every fourth japanese person is over years of age and the population is shrinking due to cultural mores workers are largely compensated not on merit but on seniority thus young adults marry later in life and have kids later this helps explain why the japanese birthrate is one of the lowest in the world a meager per woman well below the figure needed to sustain a population in addition japanese are xenophobic there is little or no immigration into japan though its debt is ballooning gdp is unlikely to grow it s more likely to decline and thus debt to gdp and debt per capita will only rise though debt has tripled over the past two decades government spending on interest payments has not changed in fact it even declined a little in the mid this happened because the government s average interest rate paid on its debt declined from more than percent in the to percent in this is about to change historically more than percent of japanese government issued debt was consumed internally by its citizens directly or through its pension system in the the savings rate was very high pushing the mid teens but as people get older they retire and start drawing down their savings and pensions today the japanese savings rate is approaching zero and will probably go negative in the not so distant future the japanese economy operates on the soon to be proved false assumption that the government will always be able to borrow at low interest rates as internal demand for debt evaporates and it s approaching this level already the japanese government will have to start hocking its debt outside japan when it does it will face a rude shock in the form of higher interest payments japanese year treasuries now yielding percent will not stand a chance against us or german bonds of the same maturities that yield percent and percent respectively interest rate dilemmato attract investors japan will have to offer much higher rates though they have their own fiscal problems the us and germany still have much lower indebtedness and superior demographic growth profiles japan s stimulative low interest policy put the country in its debt trap it cannot afford higher interest rates and low interest rates are no longer stimulative to the economy in over a quarter of its tax revenue went toward interest payments if the cost of its borrowing were to double which it may soon the increase in the cost of debt would equal the japanese budgets for education and science and defense combined higher interest rates will probably trigger debt downgrades which will drive borrowing costs up even more higher taxes and the austerity measures that will undoubtedly follow combined with higher interest rates will slow down the economy further and drive japan toward insolvency unlike european countries that socialized their currencies and cannot on their own print euros japan has complete control over its printing press also unlike greece which due to its small size could be bailed out by germany and other european friends and a bit of help from the ever willing international monetary fund japan is too big to be bailed out defaulting on its own debt especially when the majority of it is owned by its own citizens is a political impossibility this is why governments that have control over their currencies don t default they print and print they will in japan decades of deflation will turn into hyperinflation which will destroy the purchasing power of citizens savings and collapse the yen consequences for americathe consequences of what is slowly but surely unraveling in japan is important to us investors as it will not stay in japan but will spill into the us and rest of the world along with china japan is the one of the largest holders of us government debt and its demand for our fine paper will decline most likely japan will start selling treasuries and to make things worse japan will start competing with the us not just in cars and electronics but for buyers of sovereign government debt japan will export inflation inflation will rise globally and so will interest rates had i written a similar article five years ago i would have been wrong as today the japanese economy is still ticking timing bubbles and japan is in the late stages of an enormous debt bubble is very difficult as bubbles tend to last longer than rational observers expect but every year that the japanese bubble doesn t burst and debt swells the eventual pop just grows more catastrophic japan is past the point of no return its fiscal and demographic problems were created over decades and will take decades to be resolved in the meantime its citizens will pay the painful price japan is proof that a country cannot borrow itself to prosperity the us and other developed nations still have a chance to make the politically difficult but right decision to cut government spending and stop looking for government to be the

toxic crude has washed up on the shores of all five us states on the gulf coast and vital tourism fishing and oil industries in the region have been decimated by the disaster bp is facing a lengthy claims process and hundreds of lawsuits are pending against the british energy giant not to mention hearings into the cause of the initial april blast that should determine eventual liability the bbc

to permanently resolve the oil disaster in the gulf were threatened last week by tropical storm bonnie but an evacuation was called off as the system weakened and ships and drilling rigs are now back on site bp and us officials plan two operations to kill the well the first a static kill involves pumping heavy drilling fluid known as mud through the cap on top of the well the ultimate solution will be the relief wells the first of which will intersect the original well before the end of august using the same process as the static kill drilling fluid which is denser than oil will be pumped

jumped to a year high rising to per pound on friday more than double what it was a year ago and just ahead of the record hit during the civil war according to the international cotton advisory committee cotton prices began soaring in august of after bad weather cut harvests in major producing countries including china the u s pakistan and australia restrictions on exports from india the

shut down temporarily in the depths of the recession still haven t returned to capacity as they ramp up they re finding they have to pay workers more because of labor shortages said john long retail strategist at consulting firm kurt salmon up until now retailers have resisted passing along price increases to shoppers by shifting production to lower cost regions like vietnam turning to other materials and absorbing cost increases but they re reaching the limit according to kevin burke president and ceo of the american apparelfootwear association mom and pop stores are most vulnerable because they have less power to negotiate better prices with suppliers than say wal mart stores inc but even the world s largest retailer is feeling the pressure there s no doubt there may be some price increases that come up but we don t want to ever let that be the first answer that just because cotton prices are up that we re automatically going to pass that on to consumers said mike duke wal mart s ceo and president in a recent interview mary hutchens owner of full of beans a year old children s clothing store in chevy chase md worries that price increases could be a death blow she

be killing our own animals and bringing in animals from austin especially when austin is saving better than percent of them ryan clinton of fix austin who succeeded in stopping the transfer wrote in a letter to the mayor of austin that we should never allow our lifesaving values to be legitimately questioned by transferring animals to an organization that has less regard for life than we do of particular concern to austin and houston advocates is that the houston spca kills savable animals has a breed discrimination policy mandating the killing of friendly dogs of certain breeds and refuses

london britain will invest billion in the thameslink railway linking the south coast of england and towns north of london passengers facing huge hikes in train fares were today promised hundreds of new carriages after the government committed itself to an billion package of new rail schemes but there were warnings that overcrowding on trains is still likely to continue because customers will have to wait until to get all the carriages promised transport secretary philip hammond said the government had to invest in britain s future and the new carriages would help make our railways fit for the century but shadow transport secretary maria eagle said passengers facing massive increases in fares would be disappointed the government was delaying new trains there were concerns among welsh politicians that mr hammond had deferred a decision on whether electrification of the great western line would be extended to wales but in london there was a welcome for mr hammond s commitment to funding the billion bedford brighton north south thameslink project in its entirety but dismay that the scheme was going to finish two years late in and there was also concern that mr hammond had also deferred a decision on the replacement of ageing intercity high speed trains among projects announced were new carriages by may but only of them by far fewer than the originally promised by by labour a pledge mr hammond said was never deliverable funding for the thameslink project in its entirety but the completion put back two years due to reprogramming of work at london bridge a million

the project to replace the intercity trains some of which date back to the mr hammond s announcement came just days after rail passengers learnt earlier this week that rail fares would rise by an inflation busting in the new year with some travellers facing rises of nearly jo debank of rail passenger watchdog london travelwatch said thameslink passengers would have to endure severe disruption for longer welsh secretary cheryl gillan said the proposal to extend great western electrification to wales was still under serious consideration but plaid am dai lloyd said this once again proves that for the conservatives and the lib dems wales is nothing more than an afterthought and wales s first minister carwyn jones said the deferring of the great western electrification decision was very disappointing bob crow general secretary of the rmt union said the announcement was classic political smoke and mirrors with the new carriage numbers being dressed up to look better than they are gerry doherty leader of the tssa rail union said passengers will obviously be pleased that this will ease their cattle truck style journeys but they still face a giant jump in their fares over the next four years just to pay for the privilege of a seat campaign for better transport chief executive stephen joseph said the reality is that for the immediate future passengers face huge fare increases along with continued overcrowding and in some cases poor facilities michael roberts chief executive of the association of train operating companies atoc welcomed the announcement but said it still leaves several questions unanswered he added that the intercity express programme had started five years ago and had already cost more than million in consultancy fees but was yet to produce a single carriage the intercity express programme iep was halted by the labour government earlier this year and an independent review was set up which reported to the new government in june the government said it was looking at two options a revised bid from the original preferred bidder agility a consortium led by japanese company hitachi and an alternative for a fleet of all electric trains should hitachi be successful it plans to develop a site at newton aycliffe in county durham in a project that will create hundreds of jobs and be worth an estimated million to the north east england economy over years a spokesman for hitachi said we are disappointed that there is yet no decision on our bid for the iep and therefore on our plans to bring jobs to the uk we will be continuing our talks with the department for transport and will consider our position in the light of these south to go north and south again on the train to get to my destination i firstly have to travel south to get to the station i either get a lift catch the bus jump on my pushbike or get a taxi depending on the i m in a rush factor now then that takes pounds for the taxi for the bus i

palestinian intelligence official fahmi shabaneh that top palestinian authority officials are continuing to pocket millions of dollars earmarked for financial aid to the palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip shabaneh expressed frustration over the way the international media has been handling his exposures don t the americans europeans and arabs care about their money that is being stolen if they continue to turn a blind eye to the corruption of the palestinian authority hamas will eventually take over the west bank the same way they took the gaza strip nearly a month after shabaneh who headed the anti corruption unit in the general intelligence service revealed in an exclusive interview with the jerusalem post that some of palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas s close aides and loyalists had siphoned off hundreds of millions of dollars to private bank accounts decision makers in the us and eu continue to bury their heads in the sand the foreign media has continued to cover the story as if it were only a sex scandal in abbas s bureau a reference to a videotape revealed by shabaneh showing rafik husseini director of the president s bureau naked in a woman s bedroom following are examples of some of how according to shabaneh international aid to the palestinians is being hijacked by thieves and thugs in the inner circle of mahmoud abbas thousands of civil servants whose names appear on the payroll of the palestinian authority either do not exist or have never reported for work the palestinian authority has more than registered civil servants whose salaries are paid by american european and arab governments shabaneh s investigations showed that senior officials in the president s office and the palestinian ministry of finance have been diverting millions of dollars of these payments to their private bank accounts every month just before the january parliamentary election the us gave million to help fatah boost its image among palestinians the goal was to prevent hamas from winning the vote back then hamas did win in the end shabaneh says that his investigations showed that the money was given to an advertisement company owned by abbas s family and that most of the money had vanished a former minister in the palestinian authority convinced mahmoud abbas and his predecessor yasser arafat to give him about million of international aid so that he could purchase lands in jerusalem before jews lay their hands on them shabaneh s investigations showed that the minister deposited most of the money in his private bank account and had built a huge and luxurious villa on the outskirts of jerusalem shabaneh s inquires also found that azzam al ahmed a senior abbas advisor and fatah official took about million from arafat and abbas under the pretext that he too wanted to purchase land that would otherwise end up in the hands of jews ahmed s brother who served as the plo s lawyer in jordan is also suspected according to shabaneh s files of defrauding the palestinian authority into paying him millions of dollars for fictitious land deals shabaneh discovered that a former finance minister in the palestinian authority had deposited million in his private bank account when shabaneh demanded explanations he was told to mind his own business these are only a few samples of the hundreds of cases shabaneh dealt with when he was in his job according to the former palestinian intelligence official who is now wanted by the palestinian authority on charges of collaboration with the israeli enemy he maintains that he has many

investigating and why the presidential panel included academics and an environmentalist but is led by a former democratic senator and a former epa administrator who served during the george h w bush administration the academy panel is composed entirely of scientists and marine petroleum and chemical engineers bp s panel was made up of bp employees some are tasked with looking at just the cause and not the broader safety culture at the companies involved others are looking at offshore drilling broadly winter a professor of engineering practice at the university of michigan said in an interview wednesday that the behavior leading up to the oil spill would be considered unacceptable in companies that work with nuclear power or aviation the committee is considering whether an independent technical authority similar to that used in the submarine and nuclear fields would provide critical checks and balances that were lacking in an operation like this you have to recognize the uncertainties of where you are going winter said drilling an exploratory well more than three miles beneath the ocean s surface involves significant unknowns such as the underlying geology among the hazards highlighted in the panel s report were several tests that indicated the cement at the bottom of the hole would not be an effective barrier to an influx of oil and gas more than a month before the disaster bp also lost drilling materials deep in the hole a situation that hinted at the challenges of the well but was not used to address risks the report while similar to previous investigations does not weigh in on two central points the path the oil and gas took to reach the rig and whether the type or mixture of cement was faulty bp and the presidential commission both believe the flow of oil went up the inside of the pipe not the sides a conclusion that puts the blame more on halliburton co the cement contractor than on bp s well design they have also highlighted problems with halliburton s cement mixture and tests with similar blends that suggested it would fail the engineering panel said that those two points are still in dispute and instead reiterated concerns highlighted elsewhere about bp s decision to run a single piece of pipe from the ocean floor to the well s bottom and to use fewer centralizers than recommended to center the pipe during cementing the report says it may not be possible to ever establish exactly what happened because much of the evidence was lost when workers died and the rig sunk in april bp said some of the differences between the academy s work and that of the commission are the result of new evidence that has yet to be considered by the academy the national academy of engineering national research council committee s interim report addresses similar issues as the presidential commission and bp s own internal investigation but draws no final conclusions regarding the april accident the company said in a news release halliburton co in a statement issued wednesday said that it was still reviewing the page document but said it notes that a variety of decisions made by bp may have contributed to the incident interior secretary ken salazar asked in may for the investigation by the academy in a statement issued wednesday salazar and bureau of ocean energy management director michael bromwich said the committee s work will help guide the department to strengthen standards and oversight of offshore oil and gas recommendations a final report is due june online http www nationalacademies

new study finds washington business wire a new study tracking the correlation between tax rates and private equity investment shows that the pending proposal to more than double the tax rate on carried interest profits earned by investment partnerships could reduce private equity investment in the u s by billion to billion a year with an accompanying loss of thousands of jobs the private equity council study also concludes that the rate increase could reduce the overall value of the nation s commercial real estate assets and in turn contribute to an increase in commercial mortgage default rates this data is consistent over two decades and confirms that tax increases reduce private equity investment activity and that the proposed percent tax increase on investment partnerships would have a harmful effect on the economy the recovery and job creation said pec president douglas lowenstein we have said throughout this debate that private equity will continue but this will have an adverse economic impact the pec study analyzed reported equity invested in u s businesses by all types of private equity partnerships venture capital buyout and growth capital between and using data provided by thomsonreuters during the past years annual invested equity rose from million in to billion in the record year for investing was when billion was invested in more than businesses sizeable changes to the effective tax rate on private equity investment have been enacted on three occasions in the past thirty years and in each of these cases an increase in the effective tax rate reduced the growth of private equity investment and a cut in the tax rate stimulated investment as measured in the four years before and after the rate change to isolate the marginal effect of tax rates on equity investment the study excluded the effects of credit markets the health of the overall economy and other policy changes on the investment data the study adopted a conservative approach to measure the investment impact of the proposed tax increase using two separate methodologies the first methodology measures the impact of the tax increase on total dollars invested using this approach a one percentage point increase in the effective tax rate on private equity investment is associated with a billion decline in annual private equity investment holding all other factors constant thus the pending percentage point increase in the tax rate from percent in to percent as proposed by the house would result in an annual decline of billion in private equity investment the second methodology calculates that every percentage point increase in the marginal tax rate would result in a percent annual decline in private equity investment holding all other factors constant based on investment when investment was relatively low that would result in an annual investment reduction of billion estimating employment effects is challenging but it is an inescapable economic fact that reduced investment depresses job creation over time applying the same method used by the obama administration to forecast the effect of the stimulus spending package on the economy the pec study estimates that employment could be to lower than it would be if the carried interest tax rates were to remain unchanged table annual average investment growth average effective tax rate change

countries such as china saudi arabia and south korea have been buying up huge swaths of cropland abroad often in africa to feed their own people while avoiding the vagaries of buying on world markets

right now the outlook for other risky assets like high yield bonds is darkening too the highly indebted companies that issue these bonds popularly known as junk bonds usually offer fat interest payments to compensate investors for the risk that the companies will default not now in response to previous fed stimulus plans investors have poured money into these bonds driving prices up and yields which move in the opposite direction down to percent the lowest on record in the boom years before the recession the lowest yield was more than two points higher we have a high yield bond market without yield and the fed s fingerprints are on this says james grant editor of the newsletter grant s interest rate observer if debt prices turn out grossly overvalued won t it owe an explanation for people who lost money earlier this month the fed chairman said the central bank would spend billion each month buying mortgage bonds until the economy strengthens and maybe even after in its two previous programs called quantitative easing the fed bought trillion worth of treasury and mortgage bonds the idea is to frustrate holders of conservative assets like treasurys so they ll have no choice but to shift money into riskier fare as they do prices will rise making people richer and willing to spend more money and that at least in theory will speed economic growth some critics

infamous bridge to nowhere has died in a plane crash he was family spokesman mitch rose said tuesday that stevens was among five people killed in the crash of a small aircraft outside dillingham about miles southwest of anchorage stevens began his career in the days before alaska statehood and did not leave politics until when he was convicted on corruption charges weeks before election day but a federal judge threw out the verdict because of misconduct by federal prosecutors stevens a moderate republican was appointed in december and became the longest serving republican in senate history the late strom thurmond was in the senate longer than stevens but he spent a decade there as a democrat before switching to the gop the wiry octogenarian was a legend in his home state where he was known as uncle ted though he was built like a birch sapling he liked to encourage comparisons with the incredible hulk an analogy that seemed appropriate for his outsized place in alaska history the crash that killed stevens was not his first shortly after being elected to his second full term in he was aboard a private jet that went down at anchorage international airport killing his first wife ann stevens standing in alaska was hurt by allegations he accepted a bonanza of home renovations and fancy trimmings from veco corp a powerful oil field services contractor and then lied about it on congressional disclosure documents indicted on federal charges in july he asked for an unusually speedy trial hoping to clear his name before election day instead he was convicted in late october of all seven counts and narrowly lost his senate seat to democrat mark begich in the election the following week in his farewell speech to the senate he said i look only forward and i still see the day when i can remove the cloud that currently surrounds me five months after the election attorney general eric holder dropped the indictment and declined to proceed with a new trial because of misconduct by federal prosecutors stevens never discussed the events publicly when his party held a majority stevens known as a formidable parliamentarian was chairman of several senate committees including the powerful rules and appropriations panels for three years he was majority whip when the democrats took back control of the senate in january he lost his chairmanships but remained ranking republican member of the powerful commerce committee his skill in appropriating military and other federal money for alaska earned him the reputation among many in washington as a pork barrel politician revered in alaska he was named alaskan of the century in for having the greatest impact on the state in years he brought in stevens money that literally helped keep the remote state solvent the anchorage airport is also named in his honor the only special interest i care about is alaska he was fond of saying a television reporter once quipped that stevens could shoot santa s reindeer and alaskans would applaud he helped shape landmark legislation on alaska native land claims the trans alaska oil pipeline fisheries management and public lands one of his projects became a symbol of pork barrel spending in congress and a target of taxpayer groups who challenged a million appropriation for bridge construction the bridge to nowhere would have connected ketchikan alaska to an island with just residents at a cost of nearly million the proposal became a symbol of the waste associated with earmarks which are items inserted into bills often at the last minute congress scrubbed funding for the bridge in the following year stevens became the butt of jokes and satirical songs for describing the internet as a series of tubes and for speaking of sending an internet instead of an e mail most of the wisecracks portrayed stevens as an old man who did not understand the technology over which he wielded influence as chairman of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation

and sent veco employees to work on it during the trial stevens spent three days on the witness stand vehemently denying any wrongdoing he said his wife handled the business of the renovation and paid every bill they received he said he paid for the project and believed that covered everything it took stevens some time to initially win over alaska voters he was the republican nominee for the senate

want the question even asked can britain pay its way in the world i m going to prove on tuesday that we can he said adding that the budget s austerity measures would be staggered over five years britain s budget deficit is at about percent of national output and reducing the deficit is the centerpiece policy of the new coalition government made up of the center right conservative party and center left liberal democrats tuesday s budget is expected to be the tightest in at least years and with public sector job losses and deep pay and benefit cuts expected the plan is likely to stoke

senior conservative politicians the levy is currently at percent and some workers switch their income revenue which is taxed at between and percent to capital gains to pay less tax here is a tax where at the moment we see massive income tax evasion we see people shifting their income and that s not fair given the current situation so we ll deal with that osborne said without saying by how much the

ours is the most conservative way to do it other airports take the real estate risk and they set the rental rates on the gates and the other leased facilities and then if the revenue from the airlines and from the concessions is higher than the cost to provide those services then that money can be put in a reserve account cox said most of the very large airports they have such massive passenger bases that it s in their best interest to do that the unused delta gates in memphis will help speed up one of several airport construction projects possibly cutting its timeline in half the airport

associated press writertime fri aug pm et new orleans bp s broken oil well is not dead yet the government s point man on the crisis said friday that the blown out well is not securely plugged to his satisfaction and that the drilling of the relief well long regarded as the only way to ensure that the hole at the bottom of the gulf of mexico never leaks oil again must go forward the relief well will be finished said retired coast guard adm thad allen we will kill the well work on the relief well was suspended earlier this week because of bad weather allen did not say when it would resume but when the order comes it could take four days to get the operation up and running again from there it could be only a matter of days before the bottom kill is done and the blown out well that wreaked havoc on the gulf coast economy and environment is no longer a threat last week bp plugged up the ruptured oil well from the top with mud and cement and for a while it appeared that the relief well that bp has been drilling miles under the sea all summer long in an effort to seal up the leak from the bottom might not be necessary after all but allen dashed those hopes after scientists conducted pressure tests on thursday scientists had hoped that the cement pumped in from the top had plugged the gap between the well s inner pipe and its outer casing the pressure tests showed some cement was in that gap but officials don t know enough about what s there or how much of it to trust that there is a permanent seal said allen who has repeatedly insisted on an overabundance of caution when it comes to plugging the well the well spilled an estimated million gallons of crude into the sea before bp finally put a cap on it july but that was always regarded as a temporary fix until the relief well and the bottom kill could be completed bob bea a petroleum engineering professor at the university of california berkeley said that given the results of the pressure tests proceeding with the relief well makes sense everything we know at this time says we need to continue the work with the relief wells he said we don t know the details of how they plugged the well from the top we don t know the volume of material they put in the well bore and without that we can t tell how close to the bottom of the well they got drilling of the relief well began in early may and the tunnel is now just to feet from the blown out well to intercept the well the drillers must hit a target about the size of a dinner plate once they punch through heavy drilling mud and cement will be injected into the bedrock allen said scientists from bp and the government are working to ensure the bottom kill does not damage the cap and make the disaster worse new equipment to ease the pressure inside the well might have to be installed which would significantly affect the timeline for the final fix allen said though he did not specify how much officials from bp and the federal government have been touting the bottom kill as the final fix for weeks and local officials said they were glad to hear it will go forward if it s a nearly redundant safety measure that makes sense to us said louisiana gov bobby jindal who attended a closed door meeting with allen local leaders and other federal officials the possibility floated earlier this week that the well might already be plugged didn t sit well with local officials or environmentalists who said they were leery of optimistic forecasts from bp and the government after all this effort why would they quit before they re done said richard charter a senior policy adviser for defenders of wildlife if you had a trustworthy company and they said it s done it s done but in this case bp has not been a trustworthy company along the gulf coast

personnel following a recent storm the leak was sealed days ago with a giant cap but up to four million barrels million gallons of crude had already spewed into the sea since a deadly rig explosion in april toxic crude has washed up on the shores of all five us states on the gulf coast and vital tourism fishing and oil industries in the region have been decimated by the disaster bp is facing a lengthy claims process and hundreds of lawsuits are pending against the british energy giant not to mention hearings into the cause of the initial april blast that should determine eventual liability the bbc report which quotes a senior bp source said there was a strong likelihood bob dudley who took over the day to day management of the spill response from the hayward last month would be his replacement the sunday telegraph said there could be wrangling over hayward s severance package under which he is likely to be paid a minimum figure of just over one million pounds million dollars million euros asked about the bbc report a bp spokesman told afp he would not comment on speculation he added tony hayward is our chief executive he has the full support of the board and management a long line of gaffes stretching back to the weeks after the bp leased deepwater horizon exploration rig exploded and sank back in april has made hayward a deeply unpopular figure in the united states he enraged residents of the stricken gulf states when he said in an interview with britain s sky news on may i think the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very very modest then on may he was seen as particularly insensitive to the families of us rig workers who died in the initial blast when he said he wanted the disaster over with so he could have his life back his pariah status was confirmed when he took part in a yacht race in june prompting president barack obama s chief of staff rahm emmanuel to say it had just been part of a long line of pr gaffes and mistakes his resignation would be seen as a sign bp is keen to draw a line under the disaster and start trying to rebuild its shattered image but that will be particularly difficult in the united states accused of constantly trying to play down the impact of the disaster to minimize its liability bp has recently found itself in the cross hairs of a totally separate scandal the us senate is examining claims by us lawmakers that it pressured the british government for the lockerbie bomber s release amid anger he remains alive in libya almost a year after being released on compassionate grounds bp s efforts to permanently resolve the oil disaster in the gulf were threatened last week by tropical storm bonnie but an evacuation was called off as the system weakened and ships and drilling rigs are now back on site bp and us officials plan two operations to kill the well the first a static kill involves pumping heavy drilling fluid known as mud through the cap on top of the well the ultimate solution will be the relief wells the first of which will intersect the original well before the end of august using the same process as the static kill drilling fluid which is denser than oil will be pumped via the relief well until the flow of crude is overcome allowing the reservoir to be sealed with cement before either can begin the last section of the relief well must be secured with a foot meter

washington ap federal money to spur economic recovery is being shoveled out of washington at a fast clip the white house said thursday but states aren t steering the cash to counties that need jobs the most all states easily beat a june deadline to have half of their stimulus projects for roads and bridges approved vice president joe biden said transportation officials have approved more than projects worth more than billion states have broken ground or started taking bids on about of those he said our no priority with the recovery act is getting folks back to work and there is no better way to do that in these early days than by putting shovels in the ground and jump starting projects like these that create jobs and boost local communities biden said the transportation department released a detailed list of projects totaling billion the list shows that state officials will spend percent more per person in counties with the lowest unemployment than in counties with the highest counties where unemployment is below percent will receive about per person in transportation money compared to per person in counties where unemployment is between and percent according to an associated press analysis the national unemployment rate is percent the disparity is smaller than one seen in an ap analysis in may which reviewed nearly billion in projects announced by states state and local officials said well off communities could more easily afford the upfront planning needed to ensure their projects were ready to go when the stimulus was announced in response thursday transportation secretary ray lahood said recovery dollars for transportation projects continue to move at a record pace creating jobs in communities across the nation i m very proud of our record the obama administration criticized the ap s earlier analysis saying it ignored that workers in high unemployment areas could travel across counties for stimulus jobs as evidence lahood cited mississippi construction worker willie fort who left his wife and four children at home and took a stimulus funded job in louisiana he travels home every two weeks to see his family the newly released federal data represents the government s official snapshot of spending to date but the information was partly incomplete because it did not identify county locations for projects representing more than million in spending or about percent of the projects not only is the administration spending stimulus money far faster than normal spending is to accelerate this summer still florida rep john mica who voted against the stimulus bill criticized the administration saying the transportation money needs to be spent even faster mica the top republican on the house transportation and infrastructure committee had opposed the stimulus because it did not spend enough on infrastructure and would not create jobs quickly enough since the stimulus was passed the u s economy has shed million jobs the obama administration has focused instead on its estimate that the stimulus has created or saved jobs i know it s hard to convince people that when we lost jobs last month that we actually created or saved biden said thursday i keep referring people to the fact that it was projected to be the estimate comes from a formula that uses government spending and tax cuts to predict job growth the formula has been used by republicans and democrats alike but it was built to predict jobs not count jobs to count jobs economists traditionally rely on department of labor data which has so far been worse than the administration and most economists estimated i don t want anybody being discouraged about the fact that we re getting pushback and saying we re not creating jobs biden said we are creating

health insurance aides say budget experts are questioning how the republican candidate will be able to get savings without caps reining in costs is vital to keeping medicare affordable and in their plans both president barack obama and romney s running mate paul ryan set limits on the growth of future spending romney s approach is different romney campaign officials say medicare savings will come through competition among health insurance plans but independent experts say they doubt that romney s plan can succeed without some kind of hard spending limit it sounds like romney is trying to have it both ways said robert bixby executive director of the concord coalition a nonpartisan group advocating to reduce government deficits it s a really important point whether there will be a cap it will help determine whether the health care savings he s touting are credible for example a president romney would not be able to get credit for assumed savings through competition under the procedures currently used to analyze legislation by the all important congressional budget office the nonpartisan budget referees might rule such a plan out of bounds forcing romney to accept a cap this is pure romney speak said rep chris van hollen d md ranking democrat on the house budget committee everybody knows the way they achieve savings through their voucher plan is to impose a cap otherwise it s laughable to claim any savings in the world of private business competition hasn t solved the health care cost problem for employers who increasingly have been shifting costs to workers and their families in the form of higher premiums and copays competition alone is very speculative bixby said bixby was a member of a bipartisan policy center group that last year produced a deficit reduction plan that like romney s called for shifting medicare from an open ended benefit to a program that gives future retirees a fixed amount of money for health insurance it included a cap on the growth of spending medicare covers nearly million retirees and disabled people since its creation in it has been an open ended benefit program with taxpayers basically paying all the bills that come in obama s health care law begins to change that creating a board with the power to force payment cuts on the health care industry if medicare costs rise above certain limits ryan s budget passed by the house this year also would limit the growth of total medicare spending using a formula that links to economic growth romney has charged that obama s approach would eventually lead to rationing obama has an unelected board to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have romney said during wednesday night s presidential debate in denver the board is prohibited by law from rationing care romney calls his own plan premium support critics say it would amount to a cost shift aides to the gop candidate say the plan would rely on competition without caps or a cost cutting board to control spending and avoid cost shifts to seniors retirees entering the program in and later would have the choice of private insurance or a government plan modeled on traditional medicare the private plans would bid to provide health care to seniors in a given part of the country the government s payment would be pegged to the second lowest bid or the cost of the government plan whichever was lower seniors who chose a higher cost plan would pay the difference those who picked lower cost coverage could keep the difference for medical expenses low income retirees and people in poor health would get a more generous government payment the romney campaign refused repeated requests for an on the record explanation of the strategy for limiting medicare costs instead spokeswoman andrea saul issued a statement extolling what she called a plan that empowers patients and families with more choices and robust competition reforms insurance markets with strong consumer protections and proposes real entitlement reform that protects and strengthens medicare for today s seniors and future generations in an earlier blog post rebutting democratic critics of romney s medicare proposal his campaign policy director lanhee chen made an indirect reference to the candidate s belief that costs can be controlled without spending limits gov romney has proposed no cap on premium support in his own plan chen wrote providing no additional detail not having some kind of limit sends the wrong signal to the health care industry said economist joe antos of the business oriented american enterprise institute i think that some bitter medicine is going to have to be administered here said antos for this policy to work at least initially you have to make it clear to the health care sector that there are financial limits to what medicare is going to pay for former u s comptroller general david walker a leading deficit reduction advocate said it s hard to understand how the romney plan would

frantic rescue effort that culminated when national guardsmen had the four dazed survivors suffering from broken bones and other injuries airlifted off the mountain five others including the state s most revered politician were dead within hours a fishing trip that stevens and his friends have made for years to a southwest alaska lodge sometimes drawing criticism for hosting lobbyists and

companies like fedex corp and norfolk southern corp is raising questions about whether the overall market will end this year on a high note an enduring part of market lore is the notion that gains in the well known dow jones industrial average dji do not hold unless similar moves in the dow jones transportation average djt confirm them strategists tend to look askance when they see steady rises in the stock industrial index when the transportation average is not doing well the idea behind this part of dow theory is that manufacturers as well as the railroads shippers and trucking companies that move their goods are barometers of the u s economy s performance that makes the recent moves in these averages somewhat ominous over the last six months the dow industrials have gained percent while the transports have fallen by percent this is not the first time that industrials have rocketed upward while the transports were suggesting caution transportation stocks hit a peak in mid but later started to slip while the dow continued to rally through early before stumbling in recent months most railroads and truckers have reported lower shipping volumes as consumers and businesses have worried about the weakening global economy and possible changes in u s tax regulations the resulting profit warnings have pressured transport shares until now stimulus from the u s federal reserve and

in the last couple of decades when you now have a much more broadly based diversified economy gloomy forecasts u s transportation companies are suffering from a host of problems including china s slowdown a slump in demand for coal shipped by railroad europe s fiscal crisis and high fuel costs another factor weighing on transports shipping customers are cutting back on spending because of
