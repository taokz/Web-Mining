    "### 4.1. Word2Vector\n",
    " - Vector representation of words (i.e. word vectors) learned using neural network\n",
    "   - e.g. \"apple\" : [0.35, -0.2, 0.4, ...], 'mongo':  [0.32, -0.18, 0.5, ...]\n",
    "   - Interesting properties of word vectors:\n",
    "    * **Words with similar semantics have close word vectors**\n",
    "    * **Composition**: e.g. vector(\"woman\")+vector(\"king\")-vector('man') $\\approx$ vector(\"queen\")\n",
    " - Models:\n",
    "   - **CBOW** (Continuous Bag of Words): Predict a target word based on context\n",
    "     - e.g. the fox jumped over the lazy dog\n",
    "     - Assuming symmetric context with window size 3, this sentence can create training samples: \n",
    "       - ([-, fox], the) \n",
    "       - ([the, jumped], fox) \n",
    "       - ([fox, over], jumped)\n",

    "   - Nagtive Sampling: \n",
    "       - When training a neural network, for each sample,  all weights are adjusted slightly so that it predicts that training sample more accurately. \n",
    "       - CBOW or skip gram models have tremendous number of weights, all of which would be updated slightly by every one of billions of training samples!\n",
    "       - Negative sampling addresses this by having **each training sample only modify a small percentage of the weights, rather than all of them**. \n",
    "       - e.g. when training with sample ([fox, over], jumped), update output weights connected to \"jumped\" along with a small number of other \"negative words\" sampled randomly\n",

    "*Illustration of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for sentence classification. Here we depict three filter region sizes: 2, 3 and 4, each of which has 2 filters. Every filter performs convolution on the sentence matrix and generates (variable-length) feature maps. Then 1-max pooling is performed over each map, i.e., the largest number from each feature map is recorded. Thus a univariate feature vector is generated from all six maps, and these 6 features are concatenated to form a feature vector for the penultimate layer. The final softmax layer then receives this feature vector as input and uses it to classify the sentence; here we assume binary classification and hence depict two possible output states.
