    "## 4. POS (Part of Speech) Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    " - What is POS Tagging:\n",
    "   * The process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech (e.g. nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs etc.), based on both **its definition**, as well as its **context** — adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph. \n",
    " - Why POS Tagging: \n",
    "   * **disambiguation**: A word may have different meanings. POS tag is a potential strong signal for word sense disambiguation. For example, \"I fish a fish\"\n",
    "   * **Phrase extraction**: Use POS rules to define accepted phrases (or information unit), or collocations for indexing and retrieval:\n",
    "     * Adj + Noun, e.g. nice house\n",
    "     * Verb + Noun, e.g. play football\n",
    "     * typical collocation patterns (https://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/promo/colloc.pdf):\n",
    "       - Adj + Noun: e.g. linear function\n",
    "       - Noun + Noun: e.g. regression coefficient\n",
    "       - Adj + Adj + Noun: e.g. Gaussian random variable\n",
    "       - Noun + Adj + Noun: e.g. mean squared error\n",
    "       - Noun + Noun + Noun: e.g. class probability function\n",
    "       - Noun + Preposition + Noun: e.g. dregrees of freedom\n",
    "   * **Filter tokens**:  some POS have less importance in retrieval, e.g. stopwords such as ‘a’, ‘an’, ‘the’, and other glue words like 'in', 'on', 'of' etc.\n",
    "   * Find other forms of a word based on POS\n",
    "        * Noun: plural and singular\n",
    "        * Verb: past, present and future tense\n",
    "        * Adjective: positive, comparative, and superlative\n",
    " - List of Penn Treebank Tags can be found at https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\n",
