0,Zac,383,7,2,February 26,Not Recommended,201.2,"I have never been more ambivalent about a game before in my life. I have never played a game with such amazing concepts and potential, squandered by fundamental failings of game design.  The fine first, second, and third acts, while plagued with the issues I am going to discuss, are not nearly as horrible as the absolutely baffling experience of act 4. All issues previously felt in the game are so excacerbated in act 4, that I thought I was playing an entirely different game.  1. The armor system incentivizes perversely unfun tactics. With the recent changes of taunt, they have thankfully recognized this. Nonetheless, it causes both the players and the AI to initially launch into DEFCON 1 tier nuclear exchange, with the victor emerging as the one to freeze, knockdown, or terrify (fittingly, the most terrifying effect constantly abused by the AI) their opponent. When the encounters start becoming quite difficult, this exchange can pretty much decide the outcome of the battle in 2 turns.  2. The AI in this game is awful. They are completely incapable of working to together and effectively chaining combos. So, in compensation, the developers have simply cheated ridiculous stats onto the AI, often allowing them 6 AP regen per turn, insane armor values, and a divinity level capability of using source. At one instance, a random AI sourcerer had an initiative of 50... why? It inexplicably had a base initiative of +20... If you encounter an enemy called 'nemisis,' evacuate to your nearest fallout shelter because they deserve the title of godwoken over all else.  3. Rapid descent into over-designed gimmick encounters, often with no communication of what to do. Act 4 is especially egregious about this. I have no idea why they decided endlessly respawning enemies, ambushes, and gimmick bosses  were good ways of designing a game, but it is not. It shows complete insecurity in their combat system that they needed to replace every regular fight with some poor attempt at twisting the formula. Ultimately, it either ends with the player figuring out the gimmick and beating the encounter easily, or a frustrating cycle of save cheesing until the correct tactic is found. Its like... the previous 3 courses of this game's meal was just a delicious italian dinner, and instead of desert being a logical extension of what came before it, its dog diarrhea plated to look like chocolate mousse... yeah... its unique, but its ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just like every late game fight in this game.  Unfortunately, the game's stellar writing was unable to save the experience for me. I honestly recommend turning on explorer mode if you do decide that is what you want to get out of this game."
1,Shogoki,91,42,5,February 25,Not Recommended,31.9,"Divinity 2: Original Sin is beautiful, with a great soundtrack and the world design is also appealing. But i'm not gonna recommend it and here's why.  The game counters it's own logic. Tells you to do whatever you wants, put an emphasis on freedom, character creation, dialogue, roleplay, etc, but you must play EXACTLY like the developpers intended you to if you wanna succeed. That means, finishing as much quests as you can so your level is high enough for you to be able to win fights on your own terms. So the optional quests are in fact, mandatory. You don't like some quests ? Too bad, since you cannot grind because the mobs don't respawn. But that's not the whole story about quests. The maps are quite open, giving you the illusion of freedom, but when you discover a map for the first time, you'll realise that most of it is gated by high level mobs that are going to kill you outright if you engage combat against them, thus restricting the exploration the game strangely emphases, and forcing your hand into doing things in the exact order the devs wanted you to do them. If you try to do quest B before quest A, you will die because of how much a one or two level difference with your opponent means. That's not to mention the fact that some quests are gated behind a perk/stat/item requirment. It's like Cat Mario / Syobon Action, where you have levels loaded with traps and obstacles you can't possibly anticipate, so you finish them by dying on every single obstacle at least once and memorizing safe zones.  The combat system is also restricting, because of the way armor works, it's much more rewarding to set up all your characters into doing one type of damage (physical or magical) to finish fights quicker.  I wanted a wizard to support my knight but that would have been a bad idea. Because why would anyone lose time into emptying a full magical armor bar if the physical one has been grinded to zero through the physical attacks you already delivered ? Being able to do damage by mixing chemicals and using the environment is a good idea, the bad thing is that those chain-reactions are usually triggered early in the fight, be it by your own attacks or your opponent's, at a time where armors are not destroyed yet, thus nullifying many effects or debuffs they could create.  Nobody is sitting there, being like ""Omg this game is too hard, i can't advance !"" - people ARE advancing, but it is tedious and annoying. Not because it is ""omg, so oldschool, so hardcore"", but because the game fails to hold true to it's own principles and employs point-&-click adventure logic in many places. You are supposed to magically know how the devs wants you to approach a particular quest, area or fight. If you don't, you are going to fail, miss things, and die a lot. A good example of that would be Braccus pants. An item you can only find if your character is over a certain threshold in a certain stat, and make him interact with a particular item at a particular place, while nothing pointed that you should do that. There is a difference between not holding the player's hand and dumping them into a situation that cannot be managed unless you already have first hand experience or information.  So yeah, i wanted to love this game but it is simply not amusing. It's not a challenge in the sense that you have to improve your level of comprehension of mechanics that make sense, it's simply a matter of knowing things in advance. In Dark Souls, you can win fights on your own terms by, let's say, becoming very good at avoiding attacks and counter-attacking. Or you can be a god at min-maxing, setting up stats the right way to make a great build that's gonna make the game much easier. In DoS:2, you cannot win on your own terms. I should not have to steal every painting in the game to keep my economy flowing so i can buy gear to stay relevant in battle. I should not have to kill every non-quest related NPC so i can grind all the XP not to get crushed in battle. I should not have to back-stab bosses without talking to them and miss important story elements or sacrifice my amusement because of cheesy tactics being the only way to win some fights.  This ""You have to know it before you even attempt"" mechanic is not bad as is. I have no real problem with games that does that, however, i have one if they advertise themselves as putting the emphasis on player choice while it's clearly not how the game is designed to be played."
2,Martyr81,83,39,1,"October 10, 2017",Not Recommended,106.1,"Upfront, I'll say this game does have some fun gameplay at times. However a litany of problems make me give this a negative review.  - Dumbfoundingly inconsisent difficulty. Battles range from entertainingly fun to stupendously, insultingly difficult. Seriously, you should never have to go into a battle knowing EXACTLY what is going to happen in order to have a chance of surviving (not winning, just surviving). And the only reason you know what's about to happen is because you've tried it half a dozen times and failed each time.  - Weak story compared to D:OS, and heavy use of sad, tired and predictable tropes. Half the time it wasn't even clear what we were trying to accomplish, and who/what we were fighting against or for. And when major plot points did occur, most of the time our response was ""Really? We're doing this again? Sigh...""  - For a game that encourages you to forge your own way, it punishes you for not following some pre-assumed path through the world. Heaven help you if you choose a different direction - enemies do not scale with level, and gear that would help you manage is prohibitively expensive. So if you head west when the game expects you to head east, you'll struggle.  - Battles that break the game's own pre-established rules. Examples: repeat casting of abilities which have multi-round cooldowns, and stacking identical status ailments. Case in point: The Sallow Man's Airborne Plague, which bypasses all armour (physical and magical), stacks with itself (I was at -15 Con at one point because of three repeat casts) and can be cast EVERY ROUND.  - Inconsistent lore/world impacts: you can kill someone and consume their soul, only for them to show up again later, apparently none the worse for wear. (Yay, that achieved a lot...).  - Multiplayer feels like two single player games occurring simultanously, with some quests not progressing or closing because the wrong player spoke to the quest giver. To add to that, if the speaker doesn't have the required item for a fetch quest, too bad - having it in the party isn't enough (but the game doesn't let you know that, does it? That would be too much to ask...)  - Quest system is broken. Somewhat repaired with a patch, but if you'd progressed past a certain point, the damage was done. The Tarquin side-quest was just a balls-up.  - My partner, who was using a controller (I use keyboard/mouse), had endless difficulty with target selection and interactions with the environment. Certain skills just wouldn't work (no reason was given - you just can't select this character because we say so). The controller interface also made line-of-sight hard to gauge, so several times critical actions were lost because of some unseen obstacle.  - Multi-stage boss battles: stop, just stop with this tired, over-used and just irritating chiche. This has been done so many times it's just not interesting, exciting or surprising.  - Some puzzles have an exact solution required, but the game gives you absolutely no guidance or hints. Another case in point: the Cursed Revenants in the Lizard Embassy. We gave up trying to solve that and just left them there. We got around them enough to finish the quest, but they'll be sitting there in the ruins till Judement Day.  More on the battle difficulty: if you're at the correct character level for a given encounter (ie a L5 party against L5 opponents) I don't think it's unreasonable that your party members are able to survive the opening salvo. I GM a Pathfinder group and so understand that some encounters are meant to be more challenging that others, depending on their importance in the plot progression. However, given that in 95% of encounters one or more of the opponents invariably go first, the number of times one (or more) of our party members were one-shot killed or disabled before they've had a chance to act is kinda ludicrous. This ties back into my previous point where you have to know exactly what is about to happen in order to have a chance of getting through the battle (which I consider meta-gaming in a cRPG). Sure, give the enemies superior starting positions and outnumber the party, but don't compount that by making every mook immediately superior to the whole party.  For a game that we've spent over 100 hours on, this has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I can't say I've enjoyed it. We've given up trying to win the final battle, and to be honest I couldn't care less about how it ends. There were occasional moments of fun, but the negatives outweigh them."
3,Jobbut,198,8,0,"September 25, 2017",Not Recommended,137.0,"[Spoiler-Free Review] Foreword: The game is not reccomended for a few major reasons: 1. It lacks serious mechanical polish; if you played the first game, expect to be disappointed by many of the mechanics. 2. The game is seriously bugged, the majority of quests are very likely to break and become uncompletable-- Including the entire endgame sequence. 3. Acts 3, 4, and the endgame lack the content and polish of the first two acts, and were clearly rushed out the door.

4,Beeps,97,122,5,"October 6, 2017",Not Recommended,90.0,"Much like the first game, Divinity Original Sin 2 is a fun game that seems to only be fun purely by accident. There's so much to unpack here that I genuinely suspect that the developers were just randomly throwing darts at a board to decide game elements--at best. At worst they were being intentionally lazy--possibly even intentionally provocative at points.  A lot of the major problems have been harped on about to the point where I dont' feel the need to mention them, but for the sake of the uninformed: the armor system in this game is entirely pass/fail, you either have armor and you resist everything or you don't and you resist nothing. The turn order is mindbogglingly terrible, working on a round robin (enemy goes then you go then enemy goes and repeat) system that seems to heavily favor the enemy. The game is literally unfinished, Act 4 was shuffled together out of planks of wood and has blatant cut corners in the form of poor scripting, low effort dialogue, low effort area design, pointless quests and voice acting that varies from being poor to simply not existing. Act 3 is not much better. Inventory management is somehow worse than the first game.   I think the best way I could describe the act of playing DOS2 is that if it feels like you are gaming the system, you are probably playing the game the way the developers intended. In someways this is what makes the game fun--I had a very similar experience with New Vegas, where playing the game on the yellowbrick road was boring as sin, but intentionally breaking the quests in ways that favored me was extremely satisfying. What makes DOS2 less satisfying than New Vegas, however, is that in DOS2, the things that break the game are things that the developers knew full well would break it. It is an intentionally asymmetrical experience. Things like teleporting enemies away from their allies and ganking them, planting explosive barrels around enemies before triggering a fight, stacking up on a certain resistance to the point where you heal from an element--these things are how the game is designed to be played.   This of course means that certain abilities are comparitively bad because they don't do key things like strip armor, reposition allies/enemies, heal, apply surfaces, etc. The top three non-source abilities in DOS2 (Which are probably: Teleportation, Shackles of Pain, Invisibility--which special mentions to Summon Bone Widow and Rain) are so unbelievably powerful that you are gimping yourself to an extreme degree if you do not use them. Balance was clearly of no concern here.  On Tactician mode, ""cheese strats"" like the ones I mentioned are so ubiquitious that I legitimately do not understand how the developers intended certain encounters to be beaten. Of particular note is one instance where I needed to save a lizardwoman from the gallows, who was being hung by a single tough guard and her slave. Easy enough, just kill two people. The problem was--as soon as you instigate the fight, the guard literally summons four equally strong guards from thin air, all of which are right next to her so repositioning her is useless. This *by itself* would be a very challenging encounter, but it gets better. The woman had a permanent aura on her that increased her dodging abilities and those of her allies to ludicrous degrees--meaning I basically could not hit her, or anyone around her. The way I beat this encounter was, no joke--teleporting her three times in a row, at max range, into another encounter entirely with some evil bug things, and the bugs killed her.  The encounter I just spoke about could have been talked about with the same words, but in an entirely positive tone. Because technically, I just teleported a woman three blocks away and had bugs rip her apart. And that's ""awesome"". Truth be told, it actually was somewhat fun. The crux of the issue is this: the rational person inside of me is screaming in agony when I play Divinity, while the fun-loving idiot inside of me is very satisfied. I know for a fact that this encounter was unbelivably poor. But because I beat it in a *special* way, I'm almost tricked into believing blatant disregard for things like balance, fairness, and sensibility produced something cool. It's like junk food. It's a momentary rush that quickly wears off when you realize that ""cool trick"" you pulled off was probably just a set of drapes set up to hide a super ♥♥♥♥ed up game.  A lot of the encounters are like that, except some are even worse, in that the ""trick"" to the fight is the literal one way to proceed. There's a witch that will set up a MASSIVE fire resistance debuff on your party and then cast a fire spell, instantly killing the entire group. The only way to beat this fight without losing a party member is to bless the flames underneath her so you get fire immunity before she casts her debuff. Once you do that the fight is a cakewalk. It is an actual puzzle with one solution.  There are other encounters that are just laughably bad. If I played a tabletop RPG where a DM pit me against 15 slow moving clay soldiers that respawn indefinitely until one of them is killed, where each of them gets their own turn and they only have one attack, I would quit that game on the spot. There's another fight that's such a literal waste of your time it's unreal. You start out with dozens of oil slugs, which turn into more slugs, which turn into fire slugs, which ignites the oil and causes the whole area to be lit on fire, which heals the slugs and hurts you. Also every slug has a ton of HP. That fight took me FIFTY FIVE MINUTES but only took me one try.  The final fight: I audibly laughed when I realized the final battle is just an immense battle royale between three factions, where both the magisters and the antagonist's forces have 5+ people and each of them gets at least three actions per turn. I seriously just played dead with my undead characters and WATCHED the fight happen, until only one enemy remained with a tiny amount of HP. This sort of♥♥♥♥♥♥should not be the optimal strategy in the climax of the game. Still somehow was not worse than the last fight of DOS1!  In my DOS1 review, I said the game was flawed to an unbelivable extent, but that I had fun, so I gave it a thumbs up. Why does that not apply here? Because the context behind the game makes the state of the product totally unforgivable.  To begin, DOS2 was a kickstarter project after DOS1 had already gotten kickstarted and been the most successful game for Larian in...ever. Additionally, DOS2 was in early access for almost a year and a half, supposedly to gain feedback to improve the product. Larian got feedback, and they ignored it. Changes to the armor system were heavily requested. Changes to the initiative system were heavily requested. Changes to the stat system were heavily requested. None of these things happened. As far as I can tell, Larian did not make a single change to the game during early access that actually made the game better, with the sole exception of adding full voice acting--which was probably planned anyway but only carried out during the pre-release hype.   The best part? DOS2 came out unfinished after a YEAR of early acess and a huge crowdfunding campaign. Even ignoring the fact that Act 4 is rushed-out trite, I cannot understand that a high-budget crowdfunded sequel was released with multiple game-breaking bugs. And I mean game breaking. I don't take this stuff lightly. About 15% of the quests I played were bugged to some extent, some of them were literally unfinishable.  When I played DOS1, I kind of got the picture that Larian knew what they were doing but were being intentionally transgressive for the sake of being different. Now that I've finished DOS2 I see things in a different light. It really does feel like they just...winged the entire game, and it almost worked. I admire their ...luck? "
5,Zelloxy,812,20,4,"October 28, 2017",Not Recommended,19.2,"I loved the first game. And I want to love this game as well, but I just can't. I can't even get myself to finish the game - it now lays on the shelf so to speak. The new concept around physical and magical armor just ruined it for me completely. This is a RPG game, that comes from board games where dices are the main component. But here, due to the fact of armor, NOTHING is random. 0% change to inflict CC when armor is up, when it's down 100%. This has gotten me to stop playing."
6,skullplace,337,69,3,"October 8, 2017",Not Recommended,64.7,"The story and mood of the game, while a step up from the first, quickly starts to fall apart the further you get into it. The disjointed nature of the story really hurts the game, despite having such a strong start with Fort Joy, which was easily ten times better than Cyseal (though it lacked the same charm). The dual dialogue system being gone also means that co-op interractions have a lot less weight to them; similarly, origin characters don't really have interactions with each other, which really brings the experience down at times. The disjointed story becomes especially apparent after Fort Joy. It's revealed the player character is a Godwoken, and depending on your race, you represent your God and must become Divine. The Gods push the whole ""war against the other gods/races"" thing a lot, but when the time comes around where its every man for himself, its quickly resolved by the the antagonist, Dallis, and now our Gods just hate us in general and its no longer a plot point that matters. Even the endings of the game are all a let down, with the outcomes being very general... you could honestly compare it to the Mass Effect 3 endings.  The biggest problem with this game is that combat scenarios are far too similar to one another, thanks to the armor system. Unlike the first game, crowd control and status effects must first go through physical or magic armor, or else they are completely resisted by the target. While, in the beginning, it seemed like a nice solution to fix the problem the first game had, where you could CC targets one after the other and just wail on them for free, the armor system REALLY hurts the point of elemental surfaces and the like. Outside of Fort Joy, I found no use for them; everything just had too much armor for anything to work. Your strongest abilities were the only thing that did much of anything, and if you were a magic user, using a staff for damage was awful as wands were a lot stronger.  Skills, stats and talents are all pretty homogenized in the game. Strength, finesse, and intelligence are all ""more damage"". Memory gives you more slots for more abilities, and wits gives you more crit chance and lets you detect treasures (you can supplement this for a wits potion or the clear minded ability, since the amount of wits you need to detect stuff is pretty low). For melee builds, Necromancer is almost a must, because the health returns and utility of many necromancer abilities are irreplacable. For any character, though, being a hybrid (unless you are just a full mage) is a must because many abilities in each magic tree do not rely on intelligence to be useful. It lets your characters have much more access to abilities outside of Warfare, Scoundrel, and Huntsman, but some just aren't good or don't really add much in the way of variety, except for Necromancer. Civil abilities vary in their usefulness, but one that I found particularly vexing was persuasion. Sometimes, you can't really control who an NPC talks to during certain events, and if you lack persuasion, you may end up missing out on certain events. Some dialogues have stat checks, but they still require persuasion to do anything. I suppose I was expecting it to be like an Obsidian RPG in that regard.  Overall, I think Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a step back to a degree. I don't neccessarily not recommend it (but I can't write a mixed review yet...) but I really feel like its lacking in a lot of areas. The story can't be helped, though its still better than the first game, but a lot of this stuff could probably be fixed in an inevitable Enhanced Edition, which I feel like this game sorely needs. Its still a game worth its asking price, and if you are looking for a good co-op RPG, this is the best one out right now."
7,Brainwave,173,132,16,February 24,Not Recommended,86.6,"I really wish that Steam allowed us to rate games on a 1-10 scale rather than a pure thumbs up, thumbs down rating. I spent a lot of hours on this game, but I didn't finish it.  To me that's the ultimate cut off, if I grow tired of a game before actually completing it, I'm giving it a thumbs down.  I enjoyed Divinity 1 (and played the original Divine Divinity) so expected to like this game.  There were some improvements over Divinity 1.  The inventory system is more streamlined, you can look at all of your character's inventories in one big screen instead of having to swap between characters.  In addition, you can use an item or equip an item with any character from any inventory.  I also somewhat liked the storylines of the pregenerated characters better than in Divinity 1.  But honestly, other than that, I liked the first game much better.  Both games have an issue (at least this is a problem for me - others might not be bothered as much by it) that if you go the ""wrong direction"" you end up facing enemies that are too hard.  In several areas you end up having to test out different battles to see if they are doable at your level.  I have mixed feelings about this - it makes levelling feel meaningful but something like this feels more in line with a dark souls game than more of a standard RPG.  I don't particularly enjoy having to go back and see if I can do a fight yet 3 or 4 different times as I level up.  But as to specifics about Divinity 2 - to touch on my last point, the areas felt really unbalanced.  As I mentioned already, you have to test out battles in some areas to see if you can do them yet,  In others, not so much.  For example, Act II for me was a constant situation of trying to find the one area I could actually make progress on, since everything else was too hard.  Then Act III wasn't a problem at all, I never ran into a fight I couldn't handle.  Then Act IV (and this is the point that I just lost interest) there's a part where you get ambushed in several different spots by monsters that are higher level than my level as well as the level of everything else in the area.  Keep in mind I'd been attempting to complete every quest along the way, so I should have been at least close to the highest level I could have been at by that point.  I was also playing on normal difficulty and have a lot of experience playing these kinds of games (I know how to use terrain, split party, etc..).  I also disliked the change in how skills work from Divinity 1 to Divinity 2.  Divinity 1 had a Novice/Adept/Master system for learning skills.  Once raised your skill level to a certain point you could learn a certain amount of skills from each tier.  The higher level skills also had level reqs and had long cooldowns.  Divinity 2 changes all of that.  Instead it uses source points which are kind of like non regenerating mana points.  Starting with the mid level skills, all of the powerful skills require source points to cast, some as many as 3 points.  From a RPG standpoint that does make sense that as a Sourcerer you would need Source points to cast skills - however as a game mechanic I found it to be really annoying.  After each combat you basically have to either travel back to a place where you can refill Source, or cast a spell multiple times with each character out of combat to regain these points so that you can keep using these skills.  *And* in many cases these are the exact same skills (Arrow Spray for example) from Divinity 1 that didn't require Source then and in fact were used by your characters in that game who were Source HUNTERS - so after even a bit of thought, the whole concept that they are Sourcerer skills kind of falls apart.  The Divinity games utilize elemental combinations to create effects (fire, freezing, electricity, etc..) in combat.  Divinity 1 did a good job of this but this is another area in which Divinity 2 changed things for the worse in my opinion.  Div 1 had a good amount of abilities that caused elemental effects but it wasn't everything and it was relatively controllable.  Div 2 has so much that quite literally after almost every combat the entire area is just a giant lake of cursed fire.  It's not so much that this is deadly it's just not as clean of a system as in 1 where you could set certain areas on fire in a more controlled way.  In that game for example, you could create an area where enemies would have to cross that would quite often significantly damage them before they got to you.  This game, perhaps because it's so easy to just set everything on fire, the actual fire damage doesn't really feel significant and really makes the whole thing kind of pointless.  This game also introduces Magical and Physical Armor to the health system.  Basically each character and enemy has a certain amount of Magical and/or Physical armor.  Most attacks are considered one or the other type and will hit that type of armor first before they will damage the health of the target.  There are two reasons why I found this system to really not be an improvement.  First, a standard party will have a mix of damage.  I had a tank/melee fighter, a ranger and 2 wizards.  The wizards did almost exclusively magic damage and the other 2 did almost exclusively physical damage.  Most enemies have both physical and magical armor.  This creates a situation where you are almost always having to knock out *both* types of armor on enemies, or you have to split your damage to 2 different enemies which means you can't focus down anyone very fast.  In addition to this, almost all secondary effects (knockdown, stun, charm. etc..) don't work at all until you've broken through the type of armor that blocks them.  This made those effects much less useful than in Divinity 1 where you could immediately crowd control someone in a tough battle.  In Divinity 2 since you have to break through the armor first, by the point where you could CC someone, it's often almost as easy to just finish them off.  Making that whole aspect of combat (which was a big part of the first game) much less useful.  In the end, I got tired of continually having to reload because I stumbled upon something thrown in my path that was too hard, bored by the inability to use skills without having to constantly refill my source points and just lost interest overall.  I'm sure plenty of other people who aren't bothered as much by these mechanics would enjoy this game, but it wasn't for me.  "
8,Gabriot,347,41,4,"October 15, 2017",Not Recommended,88.8,"Until they fix the glaring bugs I can't in good faith recommend this game that seems to be getting unanimous positivte reviews.  So many times quests will just not finish even though you fulfilled all the requirements.  You know what's absolutely not fun in a game?  Wandering around forever trying to figure out why the hell a quest isn't completing, wondering what kind of obscure thing you might have missed, only to google it and see that it should be completing but isn't.  Personally, I HATE having to constantly google things in a game just to make sure I'm not missing something, and 90% of the time it just turns out the game wasn't QA'd properly and glaring bugs are why you can't finish a quest.  Really instills my confidence and makes me feel real immersed in the role-playing game.  It goes beyond quests too though, tons of annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥ like I can't tell you HOW MANY TIMES I have clearly clicked the dialogue icon on a character in town only to have my character do some sort of phantom thieving attempt (no they're not sneaking, no they aren't click on items on the ground) and then I get attacked and have to reload.  Constantly having quicksave before literally every interaction in the game is NOT FUN.  But if you don't, what's even less fun is backtracking over parts of the game just because of some bullcrap glitchy behavior.  In battle it's mind numbingly infuriating as well.  So many times I will be trying to click attack on someone, and the dude will just run to the side of them and waste their action points doing a pointless move that turn into an attack of opportunity instead of you know, just attacking the ♥♥♥♥ing person directly in front of them.  Also a lot of skills are just HORRIBLE with how the UI handles it.  How many ♥♥♥♥ing times do I need to click an arrow in my hot bar before you freaking register it for me to fire?  Or how many times do I need to click drink a consumable to ♥♥♥♥ing consume it?  Spoiler alert it's a completely random amount of times each time because somehow the UI is so buggy in this game that it ends up boiling down to rng to get your clicks to even register.  And there's also a ton of annoying things that just blow my mind.  The pathing in this game is a joke, try moving your party through an area with a lot of environmental hazards and tell me it went smoothly.  Then I can call you a blatent liar.  You're constantly getting story events triggered to the wrong character, usually never the person you want talking to the particular character to pass a persuasion attempt.  There's also other crap like randomly just losing items after cutscenes and not realizing till way too many saves later, and I could keep going on yada yada but I'm sure all the fanboys will defend this game to the death as being the most perfect game ever built event though it's impossible to go 5 minutes in the game without experience some sort of inconvenience due to bugs.  It would be a good game without the bugs and honestly I'll probably just suffer through it anyway because no one makes any good games these days and this is what I'm left with.  Yay."
9,Broseidon,728,99,2,"September 27, 2017",Not Recommended,88.1,"I honestly cannot believe that I'm writing a negative review, yet here I am. The first two acts are incredible, beautifully polished and complete. The third act starts to get a bit weak, having a tendency towards very specific paths to continue, unlike the previous acts which give immense freedom in how you play and your choices mattering. The fourth act is nothing short of a trainwreck, critical pieces of information being easily missed (a book lying on a table in a completely optional area) and in one case, spoiling parts of the plot itself by giving me incorrect journal entries.  Ultimately, if you can put aside the huge drop in quality as the game progresses, it nets to be a fantastic game, unfortunately, I'm not one of those people. The later acts were nothing but pure frustration for me, and by the time I had finally finished, I had forgotten about the fun that I actually did have in the previous acts.  In short, since there isn't a mixed option, I have to recommend against it, but if you can get over the quality drop, it's well worth the price, otherwise wait until a sale."
10,Seresu,381,83,4,"September 26, 2017",Not Recommended,450.7,"Although I've been having a decent amount of fun with this game, I can't recommend it based on it still being incomplete. There's still far too many bugs in the quest system. In most games, completing an objective that is part of a quest you have not unlocked yet is not an issue. Once you accept the quest, it recognizes your current progress and incorporates it. In DoS 2, doing this is likely to permanantly break the relevant quests. What's more, these broken quests will auto-complete at the end of the current act with negative completion entries. It's entirely possible to save someone, only to complete an act and have your journal claim you abandoned them to their fate.  There are minor mechanical issues still existing as well. Barrels exploding fluids onto surfaces two floors above them, enemies healing from elements with 50% resistance, quests that require teleportation not accounting for retribution damage, an infinite ashen idol of rebirth bug that leaves your character permanantly unable to leave combat..  To top it off, the only bug Larian has recognized so far is an infinite damage loop. Despite sending in several reports that would ""be replied to within one business day"" I've now gone a week without a single piece of acknowledgement of the slew of quest related issues I'm experiencing.  TL;DR wait for them to fully finish the quest system, at least. So much outside the main line is in near shambles right now. The game is still fun, but you'll be constantly frustrated by impossible quests and a tarnished log."
11,Grumpy Old Dwarf,547,22,1,"November 18, 2017",Not Recommended,186.1,"Loved the first one to bits, was so hyped for the sequel, didn't get into the early access as I didn't want to spoil the pleasure but bought the game soon after the official release. Played it with my gf via split-screen coop. The experience can be summed up with one word - a chore.   Pros: - The narrator is awesome. - The voice acting is decent, some characters are excellent.  - Some dialogues are smart and funny, mostly pet-pal related stuff.  - It's got dwarves in it. - The co-op component is implemented in a very intuitive, user friendly way.  - The music is better than in the first game. - IT'S GOT DWARVES IN IT! Other games take example.  - Character progression and itemization are OK. - The game comes packed with various roleplaying options and features. - The storyline is quite open, there is no good guys vs bad guys, it's not clear whether we (as a party) should be doing the things that we're doing. It's all grey area, sacrifice for the greater good sort of story but it's always up to the player to draw the line.  - The journal is a nice touch, way better than your usual quest tracker, unfortunately navigating it with a controller is a chore. - The Game Master mode is pure gold.   Cons: - The main story is terrible. Seriously, the first one wasn't that strong either, but at least it didn't treat itself overly seriously. The sequel is cheesy and plain stupid, but it's oh so serious about the plot. It feels like a third-grade fan fiction, or a tabletop RP game run by a weak but overly ambitious 14yo GM. - The origin stories are weak, the characters in general are weak and not interesting. Couldn't care less. - The pace of the game is uneven, often times you will find yourself wondering what's next, where should I go or why am I here in the first place? Unfortunately the game is designed in such a way, that even 1 level makes all the difference in the world. So if you wonder off the road or arrive in a certain place too early you will run into some tough, unfair fights. This was similar in the first game, but in the first game you could handle some tougher enemies by being creative and careful. Here's not the case due to terrible encounter design, shallow tactics and linear flow of combat. More below. - The combat, the highlight of the title, the thing that kept me playing through the first game, is utterly boring. The encounter design is terrible. I loved the fights in the first one, the planning, the strategies, the enemies. Here 99% encounters feel like trash fights - all are virtually the same. Every enemy can fly, cast spells, teleport, shoot, heal etc. Usually your party gets ambushed with enemies popping out of the thin air. There's no preparation, no scouting, no positioning. CC, spell combos, buffs, debuffs, positioning etc all are next to useless - raw physical damage is the way to go most of the time. Boring.  - Some encounters are just plain stupid. Do not confuse stupid with difficult. The first game had some very difficult yet enjoyable and rewarding fights. Here it's just not fun, the enemies cheat all the time, the game can instakill you on random, the fights are long and tedious, sometimes there's a key component to a fight and if you don't know it you are bound to lose.  - You either fight a long, unfair, mostly boring battle you are very likely to lose, or... you can easily cheese the crap out of most encounters. Lame design.  - The bloody necrofire, seriously, it's ugly, it's overused, it's annoying, it's hard to see or select anything, yet it's up 80% fights. - The game is riddled with bugs, nothing major so far (mainly UI and controller related stuff), but the little buggers take out another chip of enjoyment from this game. It's been in development for so long it's unacceptable.  - The UI for the gamepad is cumbersome, way too big. Cannot be scaled down.  - Loading screens are waaaaaay to long.   The first game was lighthearted and fun, the combat system was excellent, the encounters were very well designed and interesting. The sequel is a bloated mess, the story is overly serious yet very silly and childish, the combat system offers less variety, feels slower and unbalanced, the combat encounters feel uninspired, repetitive and boring. Beware of bugs. Been waiting for this game a long time but I sincerely regret spending money on it. It's big, it looks good, all the components look good on paper but it's just not fun to play. Going through the main story is a chore. Reading the dialogue is a chore. Fighting your way through boring fights is a chore. Exploring the world is a chore. There is a good game somewhere underneath, I guess some people will like it as it is. I didn't.  Verdict: A chore.  4/10  The only good additions are the narrator, the dwarves and the GM mode."
12,BinaryCat,240,9,0,May 9,Not Recommended,16.8,"It's like being in a tabletop game run by a GM who is *way* more interested in his own NPCs than anything the player does. And my god, those NPCs.  In addition to having the game's premades shoved into your face, as party members there are no less than three snooty, arrogant noble types (out of the five or six party members I've come across). Even the others started grating on me.  There's a massive mechanics/story disconnect with the party members, as well. Each one comes with their own well-traveled backstory. It's an RPG, so that's par for the course. But don't tell me this 10,000 year old sorcerer will gladly start picking locks if I ask him nicely when we meet. If you're so proud of your characters, game, at least have the confidence to give them a defined skillset.  And as an aside, the game made a huge deal about me starting as undead, and that it would be a more difficult experience. Apparently, that means 'always wearing a hat.' The fact that every potential party member was 100% cool with it from the word go also robbed it of any story impact it might have had.  Ultimately, I play RPGs for interesting characters and story. The story didn't grip me, and the characters, well...  Combat was okay."
13,Voile,169,63,0,"October 4, 2017",Not Recommended,91.6,"In short: wait to buy the game until several patches from now. Maybe six months. Maybe until an enhanced edition comes out.   In long: If you played the first game, this one is a bit of a disappointment. There were some questionable gameplay design changes. The institution of the armour system is not ideal, to say the least, and the streamlining of the stat system loses more than it makes up in ease of use. I think other people have explained it better than I can, so I'll sum it up: physical/magical armour prevents any damage or status effects, from any source, be it directly applied or environmental. Defence abilities such as willpower that would protect against certain types of status afflictions from the last game have been removed. Certain attribute stats, such as speed, have also been removed. The dynamic action point system of the last game has been removed. Skills from the last game, copy+pasted in description and effect, suddenly have a higher cost requirement (that enemy NPCs often don't have to pay.)  All of these changes have the sum of making the combat much more constricted and much less dynamic, and many times, means one fight to another is virtually identical. I personally wouldn't consider that to be a positive nor negative, if not for one thing: enemies have none of the same restrictions as you. Enemies lack cooldowns and have universal access to skills you don't. Enemies can create surfaces and status afflictions (like cursed surfaces, acid, plague) that entirely ignore your armour. Enemies have more action points than you, and they have a higher max action point threshold. Every enemy has a teleport ability, some can use every turn, AND they have a farther range than you, so some fights consist of using all your action points to run up to an enemy, only for them to teleport/run farther away than you can run, then casting something at you. Enemies have a large amount of free movement, and many skills cost less AP for them alone. In most fights, enemies start in the most advantageous positions possible, if you're trying to do the quests in the order they're intended to be done. Oh, also, all enemies are psychic on every difficulty level. If you're an undead, even if you're hiding your identity, expect to be healed, which will do a good amount of damage to you. If someone uses the permafrost skill, which makes you immune to damage (except when it doesn't, because some enemies can still damage you with certain skills, which isn't mentioned in the skill description,) and heals you for any damage taken, all enemies will ignore the character with the permafrost effect. If a character has a higher weakness to a certain damage type than another, all enemies will focus on that damage type. Expect to say, several times, ""That's cheating!""  I don't mean to say the game is hard. It's not, really, which is fine by my standards. But these systems have not been studied, and so it's glaring and annoying when unintended consequences happen. One such unintended consequence: only one or two skill trees are valid above certain thresholds, IF, and I mean if, bugs haven't severely limited their usefulness. The way the system is designed, all magic damage, as it is elemental, stands a chance of healing the enemy, and as physical/magical armour is divided, an effective team should use one and not the other to avoid chipping away at two different healthpools with no overlap. Physical damage cannot be resisted nor healed. Melee characters must spend valuable action points to get into melee, and all enemies are equipped with a cooldown-less teleport, so this is inefficient. The inequality between different skill trees and builds becomes unavoidable and especially annoying end game.  I'm also not a big fan of the borderlands-esque entirely randomised, no exceptions loot system. In an RPG, if my character is given a weapon that is supposedly designed to kill a god, I'd expect it to not be a sidegrade for this pitchfork I found in a lucky wooden box a few minutes ago. I get testy when all my strength-based gear gives me intelligence points.  Oof. End game. Let's jump there. I'm not wholly sure the developers fully beta tested or bug fixed the entire second half of the game, if they did at all. Certain higher level skills literally, literally do not work; netherswap, one of the rare teleports in the game, generates line of sight errors no matter what. No matter what. You cannot use the skill at the moment of writing this because no matter where or what you're teleporting, you can't see it. My character with netherswap, apparently, couldn't see herself to teleport herself.  Okay, so that's combat gameplay. It doesn't end there. Certain quests cannot start, nor finish, depending on the order of your dialogue choices. I do not mean ""I'll gouge your eyes out"" dialogue choices. A quest in the last zone doesn't start if you ask a woman if she's doing ok before you ask about her missing husband. Another quest in the last zone doesn't start if you happened to read a certain book before talking to a quest relevant NPC. You'd think your character might care to mention, perhaps, this NPC is about to be murdered by this other NPC. No such luck.   Bigger bugs are still in the game, too. Certain circumstances can suddenly make your characters unable to interact with objects or talk to NPCs. Essential NPCs will disappear entirely from your map. Saves still get permanently corrupted. Unintentionally unkillable enemy mobs. Don't play multiplayer: more bugs.  Back to quests- your journal often doesn't update with recent quest progress, or it updates inaccurately, saying you did things you didn't, or didn't do things you did. At one point my quest told me my romantically entangled companion betrayed me and tried to end the world. Bit of a mixup, that. Even NPCs get confused and will talk to you as if you picked options you did not. This gets bothersome when the NPCs are so enraged by the actions you didn't take that they try to kill you.  Many quests will never close or resolve unless you kill one of the quest essential characters, thus never giving you a reward. God forbid you move onto the next area, because that will close your quest and then will say you ignored it/abandoned it and assume you did the worst things possible.  Actually, I don't know what's worse. When leaving resolves the quest negatively, or when the quest never resolves, staying open and unresolved through the literal epilogue. I had two quests from act 2 do that.   Even if the combat design stayed true to the first game, and the bugs got swept up, if you enjoyed the RPG elements of the first game, you're going to be a bit disappointed in DOS2. Many quests give no choices, though imply there should be more than one, and if you choose to follow the quest, you'll find NPCs become furious with you for being forced to pick the only resolution available. The main quest mandates a course of action in the first act that will immediately make half of the NPCs on the map hostile on sight to you. The main quest often mandates, then makes unavoidable, incredibly unethical or stupid mechanics/decision chains that will prevent progress if you refuse. You're going to be eating people's souls and consigning them to oblivion whether you want to or not, bub. You were a FOOL for not seeing the big bad's super evil ambush, and you were a FOOL for doing nothing even if you saw it a mile away, because they somehow got into an area they couldn't have gotten into, and suddenly you're knocked down and immobilised and the big bad got away, you idiot.  NPCs will gank-dialogue characters at random. Hope you didn't invest in persuasion on your main character.  I still had fun. Just too much annoyance, for a 45 USD game."
14,Naharri,136,14,0,May 22,Not Recommended,158.8,"So far, this game has two modes for me.  Absolutely amazing, and utter disaster. For the section of the game, I found that approaches to quests and combat to be interested and quite varried.  I could fight or talk my way out of most encounters or approach a with a different tactic if I lost the first time.  Most quests offered many different ways to complete their object.  For example, the first Major quest is escaping from the ""bad guys,"" and I can think of at least 5 different ways to do so. Combat was similiar, only in two or three fights did I have to start the fight over to change my positioning or spells/equipment to beat the monster.  However, this all changed when i got to the second area of the game.  So many times i have to restart fights to preposition characters or switch gear/spells just so that i can beat the encounter.  Many quests started having only one or two options, many times being fight or pass the skill check, which seems to stem from 1 talent, regardless of which skill is being utilized.  Most monsters hit for double the damage my characters do at the same level, which wouldn't be much of an issue, if they didn't already have more health, armor, magic armor, and seemingly more action points than my own.    While I did enjoy the beginning of this game, it quickly devolved into a gear/level check that unless i constantly reoutfitted every character ever level or two, at no small cost of gold and time (and a hint of luck that vendors had what i needed), being taken out of the immersion by having to exploit knowledge of fights that were coming up, or reloading multiple times to reposition characters to fight the ambush and not have everyone crowd controlled on the first turn.    While it started Very interesting and full of choice, this game quickly fell into frustation of reloading and prepositioning for most fights that might have been difficult or facerolling over those that weren't.  Add into the mix having to utilize specific methods of fighting or cheesing fights just got old quickly."
15,perochialjoe,454,274,17,"December 2, 2017",Not Recommended,63.0,"Divinity 2 is definitely a game that can hold your attention for a while and you would probably really like it if you haven't played the first Original Sin. The problem for me, though, is that this game feels like a downgrade in nearly every respect from the first. The story isn't as interesting, the locations feel really bland (comparatively), combat is slower and worst of all the party interaction is simplistic at best.   One of the best things about Original Sin was that you and your partner built a relationship and history together as the game went on. You had arguments about what to do in a quest and could discuss the outcomes afterwards. Over time you began to develop your own tropes. It wasn't perfect by any means, but it was far better than what you get with Original Sin 2. This game allows for 4 player co-op, which is awesome. I was really excited when I heard the announcement about that. The problem is, however, that they really had to sacrifice a lot for characterization to accomidate that. All the pre-made characters have their own quest lines and stories, sure. But you have essentially no influence on the character, your dialogues feel meaningless and what you do in a quest is entirely your own decision. There are no group decisions. It's every man for himself, which leads me to the biggest problem.  As I said before Original Sin had you both discuss quest paths and if there was a disagreement, you would do a paper rock scissors minigame to decide who won. Nothing ground breaking, but it worked. Your two characters were partners and worked together for a common goal. It was kind of campy at times, but it made for a really fun and light hearted setting. Enter Original Sin 2. Not only does it not encourage working together, it in fact encourages the opposite. There are options that will only benefit one person. There are plot points that flat out tell you, ""Only one person can win."" It sets you against one another from the beginning. It might be interesting for some people, but I personally hated it. Coming from Original Sin where I loved the cooperative element, I hated that the game actively encouraged people to put themselves first. It might sound interesting at first, but I guarantee it really sucks to have to play a RPG where people start ignoring the story so that they can loot everything in sight before others get there first.  The tone of Original Sin 2 is much different from Original Sin. In fact, the exact opposite. Original Sin had a pretty light hearted campy feel to it. Pretty much every option felt like it had a good enough outcome if you put in the effort to get it. Original Sin 2, however, is a bleak and depressing setting. The people in the world are generally terrible and there are very few happy moments ever available. There are many quest lines that actually just turn a sad situation worse even if you go through all the effort to finish everything. The story feels completely hopeless and it eventually had me choosing to do as little as possible for questing.  As for the combat, they made magic a bit more accessible to people. There are more schools of magic and more abilities for you to choose from. It's interesting enough. But once again they made it worse, I think, from Original Sin. They basically halved your action points (AP) in this game. So you have less moves available in a turn. Then they added two types of defense. Physical and Magic. In order to do health damage, you have to bring one defense down to 0 and then hit with an attack of that damage type. So if you want to kill somebody with a sword, you have to get their physical armor to 0 and then hit them. Or if you want to kill somebody with a fireball, you have to get their magical armor to 0 and then hit them. All of this is done so that certain status ailments cannot be applied while certain armors are up. For instance, burning will first reduce magic armor before it takes health away. Same with stunning and knockdown. All this does is make combat feel like a chore. Before you can do anything to hurt anybody, you have to get their defenses down. But your moves are severely limited so you can maybe attack twice if you stand completely still and have max AP. It's slow and much less fun.  Most of this review was comparing Original Sin 2 to Original Sin and saying 'the first one was better.' And I think it was. If you haven't played Original Sin then you will probably really enjoy Original Sin 2. But for me Original Sin 2 was a huge letdown compared to the first. This is a good game but it's a big step back. I love this studio and I really, really hope to see an Original Sin 3 or some other CRPG from them in the future. With the success of Original Sin 2, I'm sure we will. I just hope they manage to bring back all the good they did with the first Divinity Original Sin."
16,Vancrist,143,40,6,May 14,Not Recommended,117.4,"I'm going to start with the positive. Character creation is awesome and fun. Character progression is awesome and fun. Being able to return to your 'base' and respec is super cool incase you get bored and just don't like the direction you went in several levels ago.   Now for the bad   The first 1/4 of this game is super fun. I loved it. I thought it was awesome.....then I got to act two. It starts going down hill there...by act three its starting to go down hill faster and faster....act four it just crashes into the ground and burrows in deep. The farther you get in the game it seems like the less the devs actually tried. The story is interesting but also convuluted and can be at times kinda hard to follow. There are several factions and you have a very goldfish like relationship with them that doesn't make sense. One moment a faction is trying to turn you into a mindless zombie and the next moment...you are...doing quest....for them....becasue they are good now?  The combat becomes a mess. The way the system works is that you have physical armor and magical armor. CC abilities have absolutely no effect unless the armor type they coorispond to is depleted form your target. This isn't a problem early game when targets don't have that much armor but late mid game to late game....don't plan on using CC any time soon...unless that CC is provoke which is devestating when your enemies use it but worthless when you use it. Let me explain:  So provoke is an AOE that works even if the targets of it are full armor. When you use this on enemies most of the time they were just auto attack the person who uses it. When the enemies use it on you, however, all of your characters will blow all your important cooldowns, use all your limited resources, and waste all your consumables. All those super hard to make/get potions you were saving? they will just start spam drinking them like they were water. That ability that refreshes your cooldowns at the cost of source? (source being a limited resource for casting certain spells). Welp, you just used it even though its round 1 and you have nothing on cooldown....killer.  Charm is also another absolutely worthless effect when you use it but super devestating effect when the enemy uses it. The spell charm is worthless because it costs so many actions a turn to use and at best the enemy will auto attack ONCE and then pass turn. At worse the enemy will just reposition themselves so when the charm wears off they have a prime spot for destroying you. When you get charmed, however, prepare to watch your characters blow all your cooldowns and go balls to the wall on your teammates with no restraint. Its just not fun. Its not fun at all.  So initiative is based off your initiative score and your wits stat. Loading points into wits I could still never get first go in any fight. At least 1 (most of the time 2) enemies always went before me and since the game always makes you group up in a tight square at the start of every fight that is enough for those enemies to just unload AOEs on your entire party and leave you nearly dead if not dead. NPCs will always also have more action points than you. I've counted spells and checked AP costs and yea, most of them start fights with 6 AP which is 2 more than you which is a whole nother spell most of the time. Being how most of the time the enemies will out number you by at least 1 if not 2 (in some cases much more) this makes fights nerve wracking messes.   The final boss fight in this game is a trainwreck. I can't go into detail about how screwed up it is because its just that screwed up. Again, outnumbered by NPCs that are stronger than you and have initiative over you even though you are the one who starts the fight. Its actually two fights in one and it goes immediately into the second fight after the first fight so any downed party members are gone and health totals/armor totals remain what they were before but its a new fight so of course the enemy gets initative over you to spam AOE on you in this barely living state.....there are also other problems with this fight that I won't go into because they spoil story things but needless to say...its not fun.  A lot of the quests just end. A lot of them are very buggy and end without telling you they are over so they are in your log indefinately. Some of them end bcause you did something that failed the quest HOWEVER the game doesn't tell you that you failed....they just remain in your log unfinished. A lot of the quests just have no direction and you are are supposed to make leaps in logic that are just nonsensical unless you read it from an online guide. The farther you get in the game the worse this problem becomes. By act 4 just don't bother with the quests because they are just aweful messes.   Crafting.....is aweful in this game. Complete crap. Its like they started it, got about 30% of it done, then called it a day. The only thing you will ever really craft are potions, arrows, runes. I mean, you might craft food to to an extent, the grenades really aren't worth making, weapons and armor you can craft are jokes and not funny ones. You can craft spell books but chances are it would just be less of a head ache to buy them most of the time. Most of the stuff you'll be crafting you'll be looking up the recepies online for them because chances are you won't find them in game or at least not before they become to weak to bother with. Its just frustrating.   Gear: This is another big point. The loot you get seems to just suck more and more the farther in the game you get. What ever random system generates what stats gear have is dumb. Most of the time you get combinations that just don't really benefit anyone. about 95% of the loot drops i got were so so for 2-3 of the people in my party but not exactly great for any of them. Like, when it comes to magic certain schools compliment each other and certain schools kinda contrast. Water and air go together well because water leaves pools and puddles behind and lightning from air can apply shock through the puddles. Earth and fire work out because earth tends to leave behind oil or poison which is combustable when you mix it with fire. So its head scratching that most of the items you get are something like ""This armor require a high finesse score to wear (not int which is what mages mostly build) but doesn't have any scoundrel like boons on it...insteal it gives you plusses to opposing magic schools like +2 to air and +2 to earth.....because those stats just work out so well with each other. Now I know with the customizable options you can very easily have a character with points in all of these for one reason or another but they wouldn't be your main focus nor what you would want on their gear. And even when you get to level 21 the game will still insist on giving you crappy level 16-18 gear that just makes you sigh and shake your head.  The worse part about all of this is that at the end of the game it just seems so small and empty.  The first two acts do take some time to get through but the third and fourth act are probably shorter than the first act even when you combine the two. The game just gets weaker and weaker and weaker which is unfortunate. There is also a finite amount of xp you can ultimately get. Once you clear out an area its cleared out for good. I guess that is fine but ultimately it makes the fights limited and such which may not have been a bad thing being how the combat system gets worse the farther in the game you go.   I have started a new game several times to try out different combinations. I find myself getting past the first act though and then I just stop caring after that.

This game is much more fun with a friend, but it is wrought with bugs and poor design decisions. I am playing on tactician mode.  For one, being on high ground is advantageous, but enemies seem to be able to melee strike you despite being 15 feet below you.   Secondly, it seems like every single enemy type has some sort of teleport, jump, strong melee attack, and a ranged attack. So every fight is the same (minus differing terrains). You can get to high ground but everything can reach you and hit you without much trouble. There are crocodiles that throw magical boulders and dogs that shoot bolts from back-mounted crossbows. Every humanoid seems to have the polymorph flying ability. Making all enemy types essentially the same doesn't make the game ""hard,"" it just makes it stupid. How can I employ strategy when everything can fly and shoot me from wherever they are?  Third, line-of-sight seems to be screwy. Many times, I will be on high ground with no line-of-sight on something below, and yet that something can still shoot me in the face with arrows.   Fourth, the physical and magic armor system make it impossible to crowd control off the bat. Everything needs to be damaged first. It blows that my partner does physical damage and I do magical damage... it's like whittling away at two different health bars for the same monster.  Several other issues, but these are the most glaring ones. I would wait until this game gets some more patches in before shelling out forty some dollars for it."
18,Black Hammer,806,224,11,"September 18, 2017",Not Recommended,55.8,"Really disappointed with the game. It does a lot of things well, but falls flat on its face in two categories.  Encounter Design and writing.  As someone who has played, run, and occasionally written RPGs, D:OS 2 feels amateurish when it comes to both those things. The encounter feels extremely samey, with nearly all enemies functioning the same. Almost every enemy's kit follows a checklist of AoE status effect, teleport, and heal. Their AI consists of picking a target, then dogpiling that target regardless of positioning or self preservation. Enemies will walk through fire, burn themselves down to 1HP, and be set to die next turn just to get in one more hit on target prime. Heck, they'll stand around without attacking or just spend all their AP moving if they can't attack said target. They ignore Oppotunity Attacks and Taunt effects, so the only way to prevent this is to kill or stun them.  Doesn't help that most fights take place in the same sort of unfriendly terrain. Enemies get high ground, player gets hazards. Enemies get to magically appear from nowhere in flanking positions, player gets deployed in a clump regardless of formation settings.  Enemy damage scales extremely quickly, but since they don't actually have gear, the player doesn't benefit from this. Pickpocket an archer NPC before a fight, and you find three gold and an empty bottle. During the fight, he will merrily pop multiple consumables, like explosive arrows or healing potions. He didn't have these before the fight, and if you kill him before he would have a chance to use them, he wouldn't drop them, either. Same for gear. The enemy archer will have better armor than your tank, and do more damage with his bow, but someone on death all his equipment vanishes into the ether.  Or occasionally you'll get a pair of common quality gloves two levels behind, which he clearly wasn't wearing since they would never get his armor that high.  The story of the game is stock for the Divinity series, which to be fair has always embraced the PC as special snowflake story trope. The character dialogue is iffy, but the plot frequently feels forced or out of touch with the situation.  Kill a named NPC, said NPC returns in the next scene. If you let me burn someone to a charred corpse on screen, then animate a disgusting blob zombie with his corpse, that character should probably not pop up again.  Overall, the game frequently feels like it was set up by a new or just plain bad GM. ""These are my favorite NPCs, you can't kill them. I put them in fights, but they magically survive or escape. No, you can't loot or use their equipment, because I don't want you to look as cool as them. Haha, look how dumb you are, being ambushed by invisible enemies I made magically appear even though you were standing where they were a minute ago."" Most of the game's challenge comes from this, rather than any real feel of difficulty.   Few additional weird design choices: Initiative is I go-you go, meaning boosting initiative is meaningless, since you will always take turns with the enemy.  Status effects are blocked by armor/magic armor, meaning these have to be stripped before you can apply effects. This seems fair, until you realize enemies have more armor and do more damage than you. Meaning they can frequently fire off these abilities and land them on the first hit, while you have to spend a turn or two chewing down armor.  The armor mechanic also means you are best off focusing on one type of damage, preferably physical due to fewer resists. So in a game with six different kinds of spellcasting, one of the better teams is four 2h warriors bashing everything to death while spamming fly or teleport.  Many enemies have flat out immunities to certain effects, for no clear reason. (A clear reason is something like a fire elemental being resistant to burning.) There is no way to predict this, so you can go into a fight only to find the damage types and status effects your party is built for are worthless for a given encounter.  Graphics are nice. Gameplay has a lot of potential, but the encounter design lets it down. I'm in the 2nd act, and I'm sick of the fights. You get access to a wonderful variety of abilities, but you're best off running a party of all physical attackers and the odd utility spell.  I want to like it. I think a really good game could be made out of the foundation D:OS2 is built on, but so far, Larian hasn't done it.  On the bright side, it is way better than Dragon Commander was."

I spent a lot of time learning the system and after many hours and a restart, I developed a team I was comfortable with. Experience is hard to come by in this game and most of the game you feel underpowered. Most of the battles are ambushes with no way to study the fight and plan, i.e. stealth is worthless because you can't reconnoiter and then set up for the fight, a standard for turn based games like Baldur's Gate, etc.   I managed to stomach all this until stupid quest mechanics that fail for capricious and unknown reasons. I stated experience was hard to come by with little chance to gain from quests? One quest fails because the quest givers ""fled"". No indication was given that this was a time based quest, no indication that this was even a possiblity. So after a day of game time, I came back to the quest, completed all the tasks, go back to where the quest givers ""were"" and got a notice that they fled, quest over...no experience."
21,Aldourien,241,42,4,May 23,Not Recommended,43.5,"This game had potential in the beginning, but that potential quickly deteriorated with progression through this nightmare. I've played tabletop RPGs for 10 years and some CRPGs, such as Planescape: Torment, Neverwinter Nights 1 & 2, Ultima and Pillars of Eternity and the presentation of Divinity: Original Sin 2 had me interested.  Here's my take on this game.  Pros: + Pleasant artstyle and shaders. + Dialogue between playable characters themselves and NPCs are interesting and engaging. + Crisp sound-effects and battle animations. + Mix-&-match freely with abilities (not locked to starter class).  Cons: - Very unbalanced encounters. - Game mechanics forces you to stack one damage type and play heavily on meta-knowledge. - Resurrection is not possible without scrolls, no option to raise the dead after combat or by holy building in towns. - Teleportation skills sometimes breaks the game. - Loot is boring and uninspired. - Crafting is cluttered and needlessly obscuring.  Now into a bit of the nitty-gritty parts. The game has good visual quality, decent voice acting (with the exception of the created character's voices) and allows for varied characterisation with the mix-&-match style of abilities. These aspects combined makes for a more natural character progression and development as the story unfolds.  Later on, when combat becomes more of a focus, the problems are quickly apparent. I understand the idea behind having a physical armor pool and magical armor pool to block each type of damage/status effects. The inherent problem with this design is that it forces the player to put all damage into one type to overcome only one armor type. With some simple math many players, including me, have concluded that a full physical party is the dominant setup, leaving one member as a hybrid for times when enemies have no magical armor and can be slowed down with one spell. However, physical abilities are more reliable to disable and lockdown multiple enemies over magical abilities.  A downside of having a pure magic caster are surfaces, which is one of the selling points this game has. Yes, you can use wet surfaces to your advantage but that is a double-edged sword. Because this game's very heavy usage of reposition abilities, the crowd of enemies you want to affect with Shocking will most likely affect your party members too. This is because of the AI scripting which makes enemies dogpile onto your weakest character (this makes a tanking build virtually useless since enemies can simply teleport past your tank, making attacks of opportunity useless) and even run through Attacks of Opportunity or burning surfaces to secure a kill.  Every encounter fought will almost always start with your party bunched up and vulnerable to splash damage. If you try to split up your party you might find the other members being outside combat and ending up dead last in initiative when you walk them into the combat zone and all enemies are free to act first. You may find yourself wander into an empty valley when an encounter springs up and the enemy are already in perfect positions (split up on both sides and on top of high ground too high to teleport to from bottom level). While creatures with height advantage gains damage bonuses and vice versa, this causes a significant disadvantage which you constantly have to meta-game around by re-entering combat (fleeing or quick loading) and remember the enemy positioning so you can setup a counter.  Take all of this into account and one hard-counter strategy is nearly required and that is Teleportation or Nether Swap. These spells are not bound to the rules of armor and can be used on almost anyone, meaning you can pull a boss away from its minions and dogpile the boss before the minions catch up. You may also teleport ranged enemies down from their perches and hopefully manage to dogpile them before they teleport back up in sequence.  My final straw was when I entered an area at Level 10 where I needed a quest item. Taking this quest item and leaving meant a multitude of creatures (6 + 1 ""Elite"" version) appearing and acting almost immediately. We were of equal level, they had relatively low health, no physical armor nor magic armor and could be brought down with one Whirlwind of my Fighter. Taking that group down caused a duplicate group to appear on the opposite side of the room (contextually) and the Elite, which was left alive, cast a resurrection spell which brought all dead enemies back to 50% health and first in initiative order. They start with 5 action points (as they can move and attack twice) and deal about 170 damage per hit. Now we fight a group of 12 + 2 Elites and all of them act before my entire party and to make matters worse, there are a total creature count of 24 + 2 Elite in that same room.  Running this encounter in a D&D Challenge Rating calculator using 24 monsters CR 6 (as they are easier to kill) and 2 Elites CR 8 (one by itself poses not much of a threat) comes up to an encounter challenge rating of 30 (meaning your party need to be at level 30 for this battle to be at equal difficulty). Obviously these systems are very different in mechanics, but the encounter scaling works fairly similarly. This calculation discounts any abilities to resurrect creatures. This game is an unbalanced mess of 'you vs the system', with extensive need of immersion-breaking meta-knowledge to overcome its artificial difficulty.  All of these aspects creates an incredibly frustrating and unintuitive playing experience where you are required to:  Stack one damage type with multiple ranged characters.  Have multiple teleportation abilities (for yourself and enemies)  Constantly chase after enemies who teleport around to catch them.  Struggle against the unintuitive targeting system (I have missed attacks when the attack-line targeted the floor and not the enemy my cursor pointed at).  Fight a system which clearly is designed against you:  Enemies have consumables, but cannot be stolen nor looted if killed prior to using them.  Mindless creatures (zombies & constructs) intelligently navigates, with perfect calculation, where to walk through a sea of fire and survive with single digit hitpoints when it would otherwise kill them if they walked as expected.   Enemy ranged attackers have longer range than your characters on equal elevation.  Lack of spell restrictions. E.g. an enemy who can summon a creature, which can summon another creature, which can summon another creature, ad nauseam.   Enemy mass-resurrection spells places their revived creatures after the reviver in initiative. A trial & error mentality of encounter designs. (discover the encounter, lose from overwhelming odds and retry, specificly to counter the enemy setup).   Yes, I know games need to be challenging.  That being said, when you are required to stack certain abilities/playstyles and know what abilities and enemy placements are going to be, before engaging an encounter, to have a fighting chance.. You have failed as a dungeon master and a designer."

23,Tom Sawyer,496,104,8,May 14,Not Recommended,229.5,"Pros:+ Story is better than in 1 + Combat is mostly pleasant + Dialogues are voiced  Cons:- Bugs, bugs and more bugs - Multiplayer is an afterthought - Armor system - A certain patch practically ruined combat  In-depth:I want to say that I love this game, but it is a horrible, abusive, love-hate relationship. I'm very curious, how many people that leave positive reviews finished this game. Because the further you go, the worse it gets.  But let's start with the beginning. The first 1/4 of this game is amazing. It has huge variety in the ways you can do your quests, very few bugs, pretty good story all-around. This part of the game deserves all the praise Divinity gets. The next 1/2 of this game is... kinda meh. The worst part about it is the sheer amount of unfinished, unsatisfying side-quests. Quests that can be failed simply because there is no ""let's talk about it later"" option in the dialogue for you to think things through. Quests that fail without any warning if you go through other quests before finishing them. Plus, the sheer amount of crowd-control your enemies get at this point, combined with crappy loot you probably still have makes combat much less fun. And finally, the last 1/4 of this game is honestly just a buggy mess. Including the final battle, which is the most frustrating thing I've ever encountered in this game. Without spoiling anything, there is a place during the final battle, that literally just has invisible walls on the field. It makes no sense and ruins your ability to position yourself without teleport. And if you do teleport, you can cheese your way out of this fight by teleporting to the other side of the invisible wall while enemies run around. This is dumb. Combine it with the fact that some enemies can one-shot you (and I'm talking about normal difficulty here, btw), the character animations bug out, enemies get stuck in the columns etc.  And while we are on the topic of endgame, let me talk about multiplayer quickly. You know, in the first one both characters had something to say in the dialogue and any player could sway the NPC his way. Well, not here. If you are talking to somebody, the other players have absolutely 0 control over how the dialogue goes. They can pick a comment after it, like ""yeah, I support you"" or ""nah, I don't agree"", but that doesn't make any difference. There is no morality or stat changes based on it, and of course anyone has to live with the choices you've made.  So, what does it have to do with endgame? Well, over the course of our multiplayer game, I was tasked with talking to most NPC, because I had the best stats for it... except before the final fight, where despite me coming to the NPC we needed to talk to, they started talking to the other player (and trust me, we tried to force them to talk to me, reloading multiple times to try and engage them differently). However, while talking to that player (who was playing a male character), the NPC constantly addressed him as a female (and I was playing one). This seriously ruined any immersion we had left after numerous bugs and broken quests we encountered on the way there.  There are a few other fantastic examples of quests that frustrated us a lot, but I can not talk about them without spoilers, so... spoilers (skip it if you don't want any). So, there's a quest about a wedding. The groom is being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who wants bride's riches but she doesn't know about it. You can find his diary where he explains all his plans. Can you give it to her? Nope. Can you give it to her parents? Nope. You can, however, confront him about it. Ok. Let's talk. He tells you that he wants your help in killing the bride's father. If you say no... that's it. The quest doesn't finish, but you can do absolutely nothing else. If you talk to father - nothing, bride - nothing. If you talk to the groom again... nothing. You can't change your mind to progress this quest. Turns out, the way you finish it is - accept the murder and then go about betraying the groom if you want. Yay... variety... *facepalm*  There is another quest that involves a person who killed his master. You can figure it out by talking to master's spirit. And the person himself is sitting in the tavern, talking about how he loves the stew a lot. You can promise his master's spirit to deal with him. Logically, the first thing that we thought about is - poison the stew. Right? Makes sense? You can do it in the crafting menu, you can give him the stew. Great? Not great. It has absolutely no effect on him. Attacking him is also a bad idea, because it turns everybody in the town hostile to you. Turns out, you MUST find a special poison that is not lethal, but will make him run to the toilet where you'll deal with him. And that's the ONLY solution.  What the ♥♥♥♥?  Moving on. Here's how crowd control works in this game. Every character and enemy has physical armor and magical armor. Until this armor is 0, no crowd control of appropriate type works on them. You can love this system or hate it, doesn't matter, it's how it works. Or at least it is how it used to work until one patch changed the single crowd control spell. The spell is ""Provoke"". And it does what you may expect, taunts the target so it automatically attacks the one who used it. And it ignores armor. Now, imagine that the enemy taunted your whole party, and you are now stuck watching them fight automatically. And you could not prevent it. Sounds like fun to you yet? Wait, there's more. Normally, in RPG ""taunt"" skills make your characters use auto attacks and that's it. Which sure, can be annoying for mages, but it doesn't ruin the combat completely. But no, not in Divinity. Here, the taunted character not only uses skills (which, I remind you, go on lengthy cooldowns and can cost ""source"" which is a semi-limited resource), but also uses items from your inventory. Your rare and expensive potions, grenades, magical arrows, scrolls. My character ate all my tea leaves which I was saving for the final battle and drank the super limited quest potion that, again, I was saving for the occasion, after which she used some of my best skills randomly (it's AI, it is stupid), and when I finally got control back, I had a mage with all the skills on cooldown, all my rare items used, and nothing to do but auto attack or reload the save... Who the ♥♥♥♥ thought this was a good idea? Oh, and to add insult to injury, my character's summon used to have ""provoke"" by default as well. Guess what, after the patch, they removed it. Great job, guys, great job...    Overall, this game is fine. It has nice tactical combat (minus Provoke), mostly interesting dialogue (at least for the one who initiates it), and it looks very good with it's various elemental effects and armors. But this game is just that - ok. It doesn't deserve any GOTY titles, it doesn't deserve all the praise it gets. It's not some RPG messiah. It's buggy, it has horrible balance issues, it is a fairly bad experience for your multiplayer partners (or for you, whoever doesn't get to experience dialogues), it has tons of unfinished quests or quests that just don't make any sense. The more you play this game, the more it feels like early access that needs a lot of polish to be good. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it patched in a very long time (2 months at the time of this review), it seems like the developers decided that it's ""good enough, whatever"".  Well it's not. I'm sorry, but it is not good enough."
24,AshtonTheMelon,153,69,11,"December 5, 2017",Not Recommended,101.7,"I put this game as the most heart-breaking non-recommendation of any game I have ever played. I will try to explain why I feel this way below.  First and foremost, this game is a buggy mess. Many people have reported otherwise, but for me personally quests breaking, dialog boxes glitching out, character's and choices not lining up sometimes, it just feels like you are playing a beta. Hell, the beta I played felt more completed.  —This game brands itself as a classic rpg experience, but also doesn't know if it wants to railroad you or let you explore to it's contents. With the way the game's quest system is set up, simple discovery of things won't always intitate quests, and if it does, they are partial and don't provide any context unless you look up a guide. What? A weird enemy is speaking your name and talking to you and then it attacked you? Oh, you killed it? Welp, the quest can't be intitated now. All for mute. Exploration is nearly down right punished unless you explore the *correct* way.  —The game's combat system is great, or it would be if it weren't for it's overbloated stats. This literally makes one or two levels a difference between going through a cake walk or having the most frustrating experience you will ever had. A lot of boss fights, looking at you final fight, are just down right poorly designed. And I will talk about the ending portion of this game in a minute, but I personally was on level, with a fairly diverse party, healer/magic user, ranger, tank, and two-handed death knight, and I was still struggling against enemies who just out paced me in numbers alone. Regardless of the best armor you can buy or find at that level, the best spells or gear you use, the enemy will 9/10 feel like they are constantly beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. Which is fun and challenging some of the time, but if cheesing a victor, which is what a lot of people on the forums recommend, is the way to win a fight, then that is a bad design.  The game's skills are also fairly poor. One in particular being persuasion. Unless you have a character that has points in that skill, good luck every getting a success. The game uses your stats ""Strength, Constitution, Memory"", and what not as the base of whether you will have an easier time successing in that dialog. Except, it doesn't tell you, that unless you have points in the ""Persuasion talent"" you will fall 9/10. Considering you can't put the person with the persuasion points in every bit of dialog, it's a flaw.  Inventory management gets ridiculious later on in the game. Weapons and items you achieve, do to the bloated stat system, get out paced dramatically, most ""important"" items are garbage, one specifically I will adress in a minute. A lot of characters and elements of the story are never clearly defined or expanded upon. They just throw it at you and hope it sticks. Good writing doesn't need to explain itself to give you an understanding, that isn't the case here. Hell, the narrator of the game, the one who starts the whole game off, seems like an important character, but she only appeared a few times in my game and her quest was never resolved. Yet, in the end sequence, she is described as someone I should feel sympathy for when all she did was try and kill me.  A lot of choices *don't* matter. It's just an illusion. And some choices are just down right better than anything else.  And so much more.  But I could forgive all of that. There are an astounding amount of small issues that just build and build, but I could forget all of it, because there is sooooo much to love in this game. The writing and characters can be great, the music and world are something you love exploring, and the combat can be fun and exciting.  But.  The sad ♥♥♥♥ing excuse this game calls an ending, the mess of writing, the end fight, and the actual bug that occured for me, just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. It was insulting.   —SPOILERS AHEAD—  The last act of this game is a mess. Filled with inconsistencies, missing plot threads, vague comments, lack of direction, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolution to add to it. One big example of this is Anathema. I gathered the parts for it in the previous act because the idea of a talking sword sounded promising. The man creating it, Tarquin, says speak to him later about it's assembly. You ask him, and he says it will be ready when it's ready. APPEARANTLY, you have to find an UNRELATED note, in a random vault that describes this one character you have seen twice is actually Braccrus Rex, and only THEN can he give you this weapon. It's an OP weapon (or at least it is suppose to be), has the best stats in the game, but one durablity and will break after a single hit. Except, despite it being sold to you as this Anti-Braccrus weapon, it barely does anything to him. It will deal a chunk of his armor or health, but any skill you use will only get one hit off before it breaks as Larian patched it so that it could break if used with skills. So now it is completely useless.  But on to the final confrontation. I played as Fane, repeling the sins of my past the entire game, despite it wanting me to pray to the God King. I wouldn't. My friends, Ifan and The Red Prince, trusted me to become divine and my lover, Lohse (probably the only thing that kept me in this game was her excellent character) agreed as well. We get to the final fight and we discover the person we have been chasing all this time, Dalis, is my daughter. Can't interact with her at all beyond that. You are then given a choice, Surrend and destroy the world's source, turning all of the world into husks, or fight to the bitter end. I chose to fight.  You then get into a fairly difficult boss battle where, after beating a single enemy, that isn't defined so good luck figuring it out, you are then thrust into a MORE difficult boss battle, with respawning bosses that you have already beaten. Did I mention that you still have to fight those you just were fighting, as well as starting all of this with whatever health/armor you were at before? Does it sound frustrating because it is. Not only was that a nightmare, if you just agree to surrender, your ending isn't affected and instead you gain 7 allies who all target one character who, you guessed it, ends the ENTIRE fight. I didn't even deal the finishing blow. Then, regardless of how you got there, they just let you choose to become divine or not. Completely making all of the struggles these ♥♥♥♥ing character's put me through pointless.  Not only that, the current endings for fane are ♥♥♥♥ing bugged. If you choose to ascended to Divinty, it automatically gives you a bad ending like allowing the voidwoken into the world. So, you are pretty much stuck with give the entire world source, or remove it from the world.  And you can't even choose to go with one of your companions. Did you spend an incredible amount of time crafting a relationship with one of them, only for the only thing to seperate you being ""you are now in charge of your destiny?"" Seriously. What the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. I would have forgiven so much for this game if they gave you just a bit of player agency at the end, instead of just seeing the person my character is supposedly in love with walking away to go do what? Play guitar in a bar? Why can't I go?   It's just all so ♥♥♥♥ing much. It made the entire game feel tainted and scewed and I can't in all good faith recommended it."
25,Nameless Voice,262,84,8,April 7,Not Recommended,152.4,"Great worldbuilding, writing and attention to detail marred by bad and often frustrating game mechanics and poor design decisions.  I really enjoyed the first Divinity: Original Sin, so when the Kickstarter for this one came around, I backed it, expecting the game to be more of the same, but better. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out like that. Some apsects of the game are certainly improved over the previous one, but other areas feel like a step backwards instead.  Worldbuilding As we've come to expect from Larian games, it's clear that a lot of love went into crafting the world of Divinity: Original Sin 2. It is packed with small details; hidden corners, small side-quests, interesting NPCs, readables, and item descriptions. They also thought of almost everything, with the game often reacting to and acknowledging unusual or unexpected behaviours (such as defeating an enemy who is expected to be unbeatable at that point.)  The quests are usually well-written and the companion characters each have their own distinct personality and unique storyline, which adds a lot of depth to the game. The main story also has good writing, though the plot itself is a bit meandering and, without giving too much away, most of the game's endings don't really resolve many plot threads.  Mechanics Unfortunately, where Divinity: Original Sin 2 really starts to come apart is in its mechanics, and especially in the changes made to its mechanics since the original game.  Armour The main problem comes from the introduction of the new armour and status effect system. Every character has a value for physical and magical armour, which can be damaged by attacks of the appropriate type, and are generally immune to most status effects while their armour holds (with magical armour blocking magical-based statuses, such as Stunned, and physical armour blocking physical-bases statuses, such as Knocked Down.)  This does a number of things.  First of all, because attacks of one type do not affect the armour of the other type, the most effective party composition is one where all of the charaters deal the same type of damage. For example, if you have three physical and one magical damage dealer, then the mage will very often feel useless because she has to wear down the enemies' magical armour by herself before she is even able to deal any damage, while the three physical characters can help each other knock down their opponents' physical armour. She probably won't even bother attacking enemies because by the time she has worn through their magic armour on her own, her allies will probably have killed them already. That leaves the mage mostly relegated to a support / buff role.  Second, the fact that most elemental effects are blocked by magic armour relegates the first first game's unique elemental system to a much more minor role. Surfaces are mostly meaningless against enemies because they won't break through their magic armour, and the combination of elemental effects (such as water + lightning to stun) are also far less prominent when the game is all about breaking down opponents' armour.  Third, enemies tend to have a lot more armour than player characters (even more so on Tactician difficulty, which mostly just turns enemies into damage sponges), so that means that your team will be struggling to get through the enemy armour in order to apply some of your skills to them, while they will easy burn through your armour and apply their negative effects to you.  ItemsAnother problem is the item system. Items gain stats as you level up, and the rate of difference becomes exponential at later levels, so you have to constantly swap out your items for new ones to stay relevant, while  the randomly-selected item stats make it very hard to find a really good item even when it is the right level. You spend a lot of time comparing item statistics and swapping out loot, made more awkward by the fact that any items sold to merchants are randomly mixed in with their new items, making it almost impossible to find good items from anyone you've sold items to. By the final chapter, the stat escalation has become ridiculous, and for some reason the merchants don't even have much stock, so you'll almost never even find any decent items for sale.  You also can't get around the problem by using crafting, since the crafting system in DOS2 has been completely gutted. You can only craft the most basic of weapons, can no longer craft magic items, and can no longer upgrade your items throgh crafting (other than by using one fairly rare late-game item). For the most part, crafting is only useful for creating skill books, spell scrolls, and potions.  SkillsOn the plus side, the skill trees in DOS2 are very well crafted, with each having a plethora of unique and interesting skills in it.  You can play a viable character by specialising in any one (or mix) of those skill trees - though you are somewhat limited in your choice by the armour system and the desire to have only one damage type in your party.  Your characters can no longer use every skill that they know automatically - instead, they can only use skills which are memorised, and the number of spells that can be memorised at once is based on the new Memory stat. This helps prevent that problem in DOS1 where a character had multiple skillbars all full of different skills. There are also fewer skills which are very similar to each other.  The game also introduces Source Points. These are rare points that allow you to use powerful Source skills. Your characters all start off with 1 maximum source point, and can get up to 3 during the course of the story.  Because Source points are rare, especially in the earlier parts of the game (and the main method of acquiring them is kind of evil), they often feel ""too valuable to use"". The game introduces new ""blessed"" and ""cursed"" statuses, which affect surfaces in interesting ways (such as blessed water surfaces healing people standing on them.) Bless and curse also cancel each other out. Your characters gain the ability to bless surfaces fairly early on, but it uses a Source Point, making it incredibly costly to use. The enemy, on the other hand, have no shortage of Curse spells, which lead to two of the most annoying effects in the game - cursed blood (which is extremely common, as one of the most common enemy type bleeds it) makes anyone standing on it take damage from healing, and cursed ice surfaces have a random % chance of freezing anyone who walks over them.  What this means is that you are often fighting in frustrating combat situations where you either don't have access to some of your abilities (healing), or where you can randomly lose fights because of a % chance of being frozen solid. You can use Bless to remove these cursed surfaces, but that costs a rare Source point, and the enemy can often just cast more Curses (or just bleed cursed blood) to negate your use of that costly spell.  The most powerful skills in each tree are Source skills, which cost source points, and use 2 or 3 points of memory, so not only are they extremely expensive to cast, they also take up as much Memory as multiple other skills. This makes getting the highest skills in each tree extremely disappointing because you almost never get to use them and are probably better off not even bothering to memorise them and to instead use the slots for basic skills.  Overall the Source point system just makes any abilities that require it annoyingly costly to use, effectively removing some of your options for no particularly good reason, and doesn't really provide anything interesting or positive to the gameplay.  ConclusionDivinity: Original Sin 2 certainly isn't a bad game, but it's still disappointing compared to the first game. If you are on the fence about it, I would recommend waiting for further patches or an enhanced edition to hopefully fix some of its myriad flaws."

No. The game begins to feel repetitive and dull after a few hours and begins to make you angry. The game seems like a mix between Diablo 3 and silent storm, mixed with MMO components; However, I enjoy that aspect of it. The story feels so dull that at times I dont give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about whats going on I just want to kill something...anything just to give me something to do. I love the aspect of making it rain water or blood and then electrifying that or setting the entire field ablaze with poison or oil from numerous sources. I received this as a gift and I play it with them but theres times they get mad at me cause i'll agro the traders or the guards or a tough enemy before we're done preparing cause I just get bored. The trading mechanic makes me want to have an aneurysm at times, remember to get paid for the product match the price in products or physically count out the money from the merchants inventory. I like the leveling system it's fairly simplistic and straight forward, however, personally me, when I get to the perks screen theres so many different things in it it feels overwhelming and so your just like, ""who cares?"" and pick something you think might help you and your party. The things I really like about the game is the races, classes, and abilities. Those things make he combat really good especially for turn based combat. If you choose undead health potions and poisons are the complete opposite for you, elves are cannibals, and everyone is racist against dwarves....it's a happy little world! There are spells and abilities that seem worthless at first glance but every spell has a purpose, like a spell that makes it rain but does no damage is very important and can give you an advantage. I rate the game a 6.5/10, not great but not bad either. Oh did I mention it is a buggy mess?"
31,Roy595,112,10,0,May 30,Not Recommended,7.8,"I tried to like this game. I really did. While it is technically true the game is filled with customization options, story, branching choices, etc. it quickly overwhelms and loses the player. The game basically diahreas features all over the player for the first few hours of play time. At this point you may be wondering to yourself, this game sounds great what is this idiot complaining about? Aren't gamers always complaining about linearity and lack of features in RPGs? The problem with Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of quantity over quality. Despite the truly impressive amount of features in the game, I could not escape the feeling that they were all undeveloped and paper thin. It is hard to notice because the game is just so vast but it merely hides its complete lack of depth and structure with its sheer volume of things to do. Also, the writing is bad. Like, really, really bad. 75% of it sounds like it was written by a DnD rookie trying too hard to be a dungeon master. I felt a mix of embarrassment and insult at certain dialogue trees which you will quickly find for yourself. The game just could not grab me in the first critical 10 hours of the game. Worth mentioning is the multiplayer feature which is actually kinda cool. If you have a group of (patient, open minded) friends that like playing DnD type games, this game is for you. That being said, my friends and I tried it and lasted only an hour before we broke the game out of impatience and frustration to progress quicker.  I could not get into this game at all. It slogs along, compensates for meaningful depth with a plethora of skin-deep content, and the first few hours of the game are so slow, so ungripping, I lost all interest. Maybe you think the lack of structure and hand holding is a good thing. Maybe the concept of a game stuffed with as many ridiculous features you could think of appeals to you. Maybe the game is better if you can get further in, but you'd be a much more forgiving man than I."

Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game where you can customize your party's skills to a crazy degree and, in theory, play any way you want.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game where every character has a story to tell and where the game world feels truly alive.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game you can end up in a game-ending fight because you misclick on something and have to reload an autosave from 40+ minutes ago.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game that gives you very vague pointers to a quest that you can fail simply by picking an unmarked dialogue option or by not speaking to some unmarked person in an unmarked location whose name is some unrecognizable fantasy mumbo-jumbo listed in a horribly unhelpful journal system.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game where you can tab out, grab a glass of water, then tab back in and the eight enemies with twice your stats you're fighting so you can progress in the story still won't be done TPK-ing you.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game to give you five different dialouge options and have the outcome be the same no matter which one you pick, even if you simply attempt to walk into the room and blow the person you're talking to up.  Of course, it's pretty obvious I'm just bad at the game, but ♥♥♥♥ me for wanting a game I can play on normal without cheesing it, right? I've put hundreds of hours into isometric rpgs (NWN, Tyranny, Baldur's Gate) and I've never encountered one so paradoxically annoying as this one.   The ""story mode"" makes the game a joke, yet the classic mode requires more build metamancing and AI exploitation than actual tactics to beat. The game gives you horribly vague breadcrumbs that you're supposed to follow for quests in a pointerless open world, yet sometimes railroads you into doing things while making you think you have a choice. It's absurd. It's simply not fun for me.  Clearly it's a subjective and unpopular opinion, but I don't reccomend this."
33,No Karma,57,6,1,June 2,Not Recommended,81.1,"**Spoilers Ahead** I was hoping this game would be a successor to Baldur's Gate series but I am really disappointed in the battle mechanics.  I wanted to really like this game and do really like the story.  It plays like the Baldur’s Gate series game in scope and detail.  The first Act is good but you can see the lack of AI tactics in the game at the start.  Enemies always have more armor and always have initiative.  Your characters always start out grouped together, making it easy for enemies to utilize mass damage abilities.  Additionally, in later acts enemies always spam with charm or Necrofire (fire with curse) before you get to do anything as they, again, always have initiative.  After Act III the game isn’t fun anymore.  Other reviewers saying the game is easy or you really need to use tactics really do not understand what tactics mean.  The tactics don’t change if every single battle starts with you losing initiative and being spammed with the same two spells over again.  The only way to counter this is to spam the same two spells back at the enemy.  This is not tactics, its just rinse and repeat game play. As to the professional reviews, thanks for reviewing only the first Act and not the entire game.  Cause if you did, you would be frustrated by the battle mechanics as everyone else who has attempted to complete the story.  The end game Acts are the most frustrating of all, as you are supposed to be this all powerful chosen one only to have every enemy be more powerful then your “god like” characters.  I can see the main protagonists as being the same or slightly more powerful then your characters, thus presenting a challenge.  However, even the supporting peon characters have more (sometimes double) the armor and power as your characters.  This is even if you have artifact equipment and 15+ skill in your primary abilities.  I would not have purchased this game knowing the AI was so bad and bugs still weren’t fixed as of June 2018. I have to admit that the story is very completing and there are a lot of side quests that are fun, compelling, and relate to the main story arc.  However, even on the easiest game settings, any battle after Act III is tedious and frustrating.  The developers seemed to spend a lot of time on the story, which is great, but if the story requires major battles to progress the outcome of the story, the AI need to be significantly better then what was released.  The Baldur’s Gate series (20, 18, 6 and 5-year older versions) has better AI.  There are also a few side story arc stopping bugs that still have not been fixed since release. Bottom line, avoid this game at all costs if you don’t like to be frustrated, don’t like repetitive AI, and don’t enjoy some story line bugs that prevent progress.  The story is very good and entertaining but game play itself is horrible.  If your looking for a Baldur’s Gate series successor, this is not it. "
34,Loupy,50,8,0,April 5,Not Recommended,88.8,"What could have been a rich gameplay experience gets trashed by several questionable design decisions.   Stat system with unique contributes to character design? Mucked up somehow by cheap builds and a dozen bad-build pit traps.  Relatively one-of-a-kind terrain manipulation? Almost all mid/end-game fights end up in one giant pool of cursed necrofire.  Everyone loves crafting systems! ..what am I saying? No one loves crafting systems, and this one ought been aborted at conception.  Level scaling is pretty awful. Very little difference in gear from 1-5, but by 14+, you want to repurchase all your gear every level.  Plenty of skills to go around and mesh and make weird combos. ..with too-long cooldowns and a Memory requirement that eats up half your stat allocation. Civil abilities that are damn near required to find quests don't come quickly enough. Talents are spiffy, but sparse and not applicable to some builds.  Loved the voiceover work. That's a plus. Shame about the WORLD THAT DESPERATELY WANTS TO DIE and is awash in /r/14anddeep moral greyness that presents the worst people being required to do quests for to get xp.   It started off so interesting, but fell flat. My recommendation, if you get this game, is to use the tools and editor to make adventures of your own, skills of your own, and have fun with it that way.

35,aphex,192,34,3,"October 22, 2017",Not Recommended,88.0,"This is the first review I've bothered to write about a game in my 14 years of being on steam. I'm taking the time because I'm extremely frustrated with the incredible dive in quality and game play experience the game takes after the opening chapter.  I'm voting this game down because, while I completely love the oepning zone I've found the rest of the game to be frustrating and tedious. At the start of this game you'll feel like exploring and experimenting with everything you come across because there's so much you can do. But in the second section the randomness in difficulty and scaling will force you to become tactical and calculated. You will feel that exploration is punished by mobs outside your viable level range, but you won't be provided with clear targets to persue. What was beautiful and fun becomes tedious and boring very quickly.  Combined with the many, many, dialogue and quest bugs, this makes the game far less than appealling.  Before going into details I want to add that this isn't about the difficulty. If I respec my characters in certains ways, take advantage of min/maxing, and use tried and true tactics while avoiding out of reach fights, then the game is easy to continue with. But everything about this world screams that I shouldn't have to do that! That there should be some way to afford my skill books *without* needing to steal. That I should be able to make a persuassion check without full min/max into the required stats. None of that is the case - after Fort Joy you are severely limited in scope for experimentation by the systems of play.  I loved Fort Joy! I thought about the game all the time, ways to do things, stuff to try. And just like that, almost instantly, I'm completely hating it. Tells you a lot about where the time an effort was spent.   The details below...  Fort Joy is great - the game feels polished and balanced. Some fights are hard and some are easy but playing on Tactician level difficulty I felt like it was a tough, punishing, but ultimately fun experience. After Fort Joy the game takes a huge dive in polish while the difficulty level becomes very randomised.  There are fights which seem absolutely natural to the flow of the zone, and which are initiated by dialogue (so you don't just avoid them) which are stupidly more difficult than the large boss battles you've just played through. To be clear, these are little plebs you're fighting, the same types of guys you fought on Fort Joy, but suddenly they are 3-4 levels higher than you can possibly be when entering the zone. This is such poor game design. I'm literally pointed to find these character as my main quest only to enter a fight that I have to completely cheese to get through, and it has no story implication. It's not a special fight. It's just some normal dudes, who can kill any of your characters in one turn.  It's not just one fight either. There's level 8 fights right next to 8*lvl 11 mob fights and no discernable way for you to see the danger coming. Again, this is bad game design - you're being led down one path and being flogged for it.   If there were pointers, or there was an indication of where you *should* go, then I'd be less frustrated. But the game offers you nothing. The Journal is almost useless - in fact it was like this in Fort Joy as well but the quests themselves were more clear cut and controlled, giving a sense of exploration and freedom while also not throwing you far out of your depth unless you wanted that. Sometimes I did, and got smacked for it occassionally, but that was just. In Reaper's Coast there is no such sense of restriction, you just have to blunder around blindly and hope.   Part of the problem with this is the level scaling. This has been detailed elsewhere but the difference in levels can have absolutely huge implications on your ability to fight. Again, this in itself isn't a problem, but when you combine it with a lack of information and where you *could* go then it's painful.  Other problems post Fort Joy:  Terrible scaling of dialogue checks - I can win none of them and I hear this is a common problem. For a game that encourages you to try different things, it also absolutely enforces min/maxing of your characters to succeed. Which makes the required stats for roles to be successful very stupid.  Economics - Right now you essentially need to use pickpocket to be able to get most of the skills you require. You also require Barter min/max on one character, and Lucky on another character helps a lot. Without those three things you cannot expect to have decent equipment after Fort Joy. Given that skills also cost money you get punished also from the amount of fun you have, not just the difficulty from lower level equipment. Interestingly enough even killing vendors and everyone doesn't give you that much gold - you really have to gimp the economic system if you want access to skills. Costs also, by the way, scale poorly with levels.  Polish and Bugs - there are a lot of bugs in dialogue, quests and logs in this section. There were quite a few in Fort Joy too but now it's just silly. Almost every quest has some strangeness too it and most look so easy to fix. You honestly have to wonder how few people Larian had QC'ing a product which is this ambitious.   In the end I really want to love this game but I've just gotten so bored in the new zone. Everytime I try something exciting I just get shut down by horrible scaling and mechanics. Fort Joy encouraged exploration and experimentation, Driftwood just encourages you to cheese and tactical perfection. I feel like I'm playing a tactical game and not a role playing game suddenly. This is disappointing."

40,FieldMedic,247,17,0,"October 2, 2017",Not Recommended,172.3,"I really wanted to enjoy this title but I can't get into it. The new armor system is a let down. You can't even taunt targets without stripping them of all their armor points first. Magic is extremely difficult to use without risking friendly fire. Some of the fights are extremely poorly designed (ship fight between Acts 1 and 2, I'm looking at you) and the devs love to 'gotcha' by introducing enemies and elements into combat you couldn't have known about before starting the engagement (much save / reload and trial / error required).     The illusion of choice is also especially bad. Basically you have the way the developers want you to solve the problem and then all the wrong ways. Feel free to select the wrong way if you want things to be more difficult. On top of those things I found the story to be an extremely typical 'you are the chosen one and only you can save the universe' tale. Some very eye rolling fondling over your character really turned me off of the plot. The individual character stories are more interesting but only make up a tiny percentage of what you'll spend your time doing - which is mostly wandering around large environments looting barrels and managing your inventory.    Some final notes. Crafting is a chore but at least it's completely ignorable. There's a ton of things to read but most of that is also easily ignored. You will likely feel compelled to play one of the 'origin' characters instead of making a custom character because you miss out on content if you don't. Graphics and sounds are fine but nothing really stands out as outstanding. The entire game is voice acted which is great, although that voice acting is just serviceable. Lastly this is an incredibly long game, which I suppose means good value to some but to me means bloat and poor pacing. Divinity lost me in Act 2, which is about half way through, and I can't see myself playing another 40-50 hours of this."
41,Amorous Bicurious Pholidota,202,48,2,"September 16, 2017",Not Recommended,47.2,"1. UI   Menus for crafting, character sheets and so on are obstructive. Terrain such as bridges, overhanging cliffs etc block nearly all vision of your party which makes it difficult to navigate through streets and valleys. Sometimes you can end up walking all the way up a hill and through a an environment hazard because you clicked on a random cliff edge above wherever your characters were.  2. Combat and quests  Unless you thoroughly go through each area and soak up as many quests as possible you will be underleveled and undergeared. This, in combination with the ruthless AI, makes combat an absolute chore that requires savescumming.   Element interactions and environmental hazards are poorly explained and require experimentation to fully understand. So much can be going on during a fight that it is difficult to gauge what is happening at any given time. Aiming up and down cliffs also seems to have random restrictions placed on what you can and cannot hit (spells can't go over banisters, but arrows act like ICBM's when shot up from the first floor).   3. Camera  The camera is at the perfect level of awkwardness where it requires you to zoom allll the way out to see where you're going but demands you zoom back in to pixel hunt for objects. It's easy to lose track of dead bodies in tall grass or behind bushes unless you outline them with fire spells first. Sometimes a combination of bad geometry and camera angles will make it impossible for you to see enemy NPC's at all. It is very frustrating to walk into a random ambush after failing to manually save the game.  4. Map design  Maps act like extended corridors for the sake of staging ambushes. Walk into an area -> autosave function triggers -> hostile NPC gives you 1-3 responses which almost always end up in a fight.  5. Skills, attributes  The effectiveness of any given build during a blind run comes down to dumb luck.   Example: I ran into some lava slugs in a cavern. Unless I had taken the trait that allowed me to diplomatically talk to slugs/dogs/cats I would have had to fight them with a butter knife and wool clothes. I had literally no idea that would be useful prior to that situation.   There are a bunch of other, smaller issues I could also talk about but these are the core problems I have had with the game over six hours.  Edit  Whoever designed the second act boat fight is a goddamned sadist. Enemies moving before their turn, necro fire spam, inability to place my healers next to the NPC... what the ♥♥♥♥. It's like I'm playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."
42,Ventus,269,16,1,"October 3, 2017",Not Recommended,494.2,"Like the others, too many RPG/Game busting bugs. Wait for Enhanced Edition/Sale/More patches. This game is bugged from beginning to the final quest (serious, story broken ending bugs, plenty of reporting on forums if you want to ruin it for youself, but I recommend avoiding for a while).  My final conclusion is to wait for a heavy discount and more patches to fix broken/bad content.   My gameplay hours trump most (despite being inflated by afking with game running) but i've stuck it out and tried to report as many bugs as possible. Simply put this is great game potential, yet mared by bugs everywhere (for a metric, patch 3 addressed over 100 features and bugs alone, many of which were known for months of early access). This makes the game, as it stands, very hard to enjoy as you don't know what is bugged and what is a feature. Moreover, quests, despite being completed correctly, still flag as incomplete (and thus the game treats you as having not done the stuff you did) and this alone is tire screeching for any RPG.   Features are generally much the same as D:OS1 but again they feel like beta or just bad in some areas, and splendid in others. Dialogue and Banter chat log feature has never once functioned to date. Some fights in game warrant explaination on wtf Larian was thinking (Dreamers Portal) and most of the status and features require trail and error to get a grasp of (Ring: 6 Vitality apparently means 'this ring gives you constant healing equal to the HP from 7 constitution (and each point of constitution give 7% vitality, which are your Hit Points). Personal preferences aside, quite a number of 'intended features' are either frustrating (not being able to mouse over enemy debuffs to read description) or simply are broken/never made it into the game. There is a good deal number of dialogues that are only partly voiced, meaning that its either more bugs (not playing voice script properly) or intended that way.  Another Example: The quest log (arguably important) is poorly implimented. Supposing you avoid the bugged logs, it doesn't fully complete for each zone. It also updates per interaction (so if you find a boss, then later find a note hinting where the boss is, the note will be the top update). This results in you not knowing if the quest if still in your current Act (and thus you will miss out if you leave) or if the quest is continued in the next act. Its guessing game or risk forum spoilers."

Unfortunately combat, even on the easiest setting, is like pulling teeth.

You can dispell it at great cost but it doesn't matter because the next time an enemy bleeds everything is cursed again. You constantly lose control of your party members to effects and when the AI controls your party it always does the dumbest possible thing.  To make things worse the AI moves at a snails pace in combat meaning their turns take too long. When facing a large number of enemies I often just alt tab and look at imgur for three to four minutes and even then sometimes the AI still hasn't finished there turn.

This is a direct qoute of the game's interface, which actually and directly *tells* you that the given area/encounter/fight/building/quest/blahblah/yaddayadda will get long, tiresome and frustrating. And man, does it happen often. On CLASSIC friggin difficulty. Get ready to be OHK'd a lot. Every 'boss' encounter is a few levels above you, unless you grind every single quest.  And here lies the conundrum (wrappen in an enigma (wrapped in a pastry (wrapped in a 'whyohwhy'))). Theenemies  world may be open, but your choices are *not*. Want to ventrue this way, on a whim carry-me-game-world-oh-you-open-and-free-beast-you? Nope, enemies outlevel you, you die. Want to skip running every errand in this town and continue your oh-so-mother-of-all-epicness-epic-quest? Nope, you have to talk to everything and do everyone (err, or the other way around). Because at level 10, enemies level 12 spell doom (with a capital D, capital O, capital YOUWANTMORE?). This happens constantly, meaning that for every larger fight you need a plan, a trick, a five-barrels-of-cursed-oil-in-your-inventory contingency.  It just gets tiresome.  If you have the 10 hours a day to spend on a video game, good for you, have fun. If you don't, you'll be playing this for weeks, one fight at a time, getting smashed by a 1000HP-250DMG-per-hit-voidwoken vs your 100-armor crew.  There's still a complex, large, ambitious, no-hand-holding-making-you-think game under the 5-boss-fights-per-area aggravation. It's just not as fun as the developers appear to believe to get clobbered each time, before you get (ahem, re-re-re-re-reload) the fight just right."
45,A Nameless Ghoul,115,12,0,"October 14, 2017",Not Recommended,23.2,"I really tried to get into this game, given the 10/10 scores and consistent positive feedback. The promises are all there. Multiple branching pathways, full voice acting, and battle mechanics. The problem is, the game is simply not fun. On normal difficulty level, the game simply does not provide you with the means to empower your characters and overcome main questlines without resorting to spamming/exploiting game mechanics like pickpocketing and stealth. Virtually everyone I've heard playing this game has had to resort to the same strategy in act 1 and that is not good role playing mechanics if the level threshold has been set so high that the player cannot explore and act freely.  I get that this is not a game for casuals but at least developors like Bioware give players more content and choices through which to grow characters and have a fighting chance against higher tiered enemies.  The inventory system is beyond archaic, I've literally spent one third of this game having to sift through menus and bags. It's 2017, is it too much to ask for shared inventory and filter options?  And lastly the writing...it's okay, but again, for game getting all of these coveted perfect scores, I was expecting characters and story which were a bit less tropish.  I'm not saying Origina Sin 2 is a terrible game and as I stated before, you do get all of the features and promises as stated on the box which is rare in games these days. The problem is the game just turns in to a slog where you are constantly quick loading because of high level thresholds for quests in which you have NO means whatsoever to grind a little bit or do side quests to accomate for the difficulty.  It's very clear that a lot of work and care went into making this game, but ultimately it just isn't fun and relies too much on it's gimmicky battle systems."
46,Islendingen,320,11,0,February 21,Not Recommended,48.2,"I loved D:OS so I picked this game up expecting something similar in way of feel and experience. At the start the feeling I got was kind of like that, but with characters that felt like they had more depth to them and a revamped combat system. My inital thought was ""I wonder how this will work out. Can't wait to see the full extent of it."" I felt like the first game needed an improvement on the combat system. I liked it, but at the same time it felt like it needed some improvements, something I hoped they had adressed in D:OS2.  What I met however was a combat system that, the further into the game I got, proved itself the most tedious gameplay I have ever experienced. The addition of armor wasn't much of a problem in the beginning. It just acted as a buffer to not go full CC at the start of combat. However the further I got the more armor the enemies got, and the more boring the game became for me. Having to spend 5-10 min just grinding down enemies armor hoping you can do enough dmg to their health before they use a spell or potion to buff their armor back up, feels like a bunch of kids screaming ""you can't hurt me because I got this special armor!"" As someone who really enjoyed playing a mage that could burn, freeze, charm or sleep enemies, I couldn't get over the way the armor makes every enemy immune to all this.  I tried to get over my feelings for quite some time, and I liked the rest of the game (the story, scenery, music and just random banter and funny stuff you encounter), but the combat system ruined the experience for me. That's why I would not recommend this game if you enjoyed the combat system in the first game at all."
47,Jimmy_Carter,218,3,0,May 25,Not Recommended,175.8,"I think Steam probably needs a neutral option for reviews, this game being a prime reason why. The game was a solid experience through most of it, but faltered a bit in the last chapter. Throughout the first 3 chapters, I was so engrossed in the game that I tried to complete every single side quest. For the most part, I found the combat fun, inuitive and satisfying. However, as I said, the last chapter slows down a bit, and the ending... well without spoiling anything... it leaves a lot to be desired. I can see what the devs were going for with the ending, but it made me feel like most of the stuff I did was for nothing. On top of that, there are a number of other problems that got on my nerves throughout my playthrough(s). On a number of occassions, your characters are forced into unescapable dialogue, and the character that enters said dialogue is just the one that happens to be closest to the NPC. As a result of this, on several occassions I had to reload a save as options were locked off for me, because the character that was forced into the dialogue did not have the prerequisite persuasion skill or tags. Another major issue is that I found the game was somewhat linear, although it presents itself as open-world. Many of the encounters will be impossible until you reach a certain level, and as a result, I found myself having to ascertain a particular order in which to play the encounters, so that I wouldn't get trashed, and in my opinion, those defeats before I ascertained the order was not due to my skill level as at the point that I attempted them, my characters could barely make a dent into the enemy's armour or health. I also dislike the dev's decision to make you stuck with a set of companions. I would have liked to switch out my companions at will, instead of having to make my choice and go through the rest of the game with it. I didn't really have too many issues with bugs, but there were a few here and there. On top of that, the game has you go through questlines, and jump through hoops, only to find that no matter what you do, everything you did was pointless. One particular instance was a side quest during the final chapter. After going through several difficult encounters, because I didn't have a specific companion in my party, I could not continue the questline, and no matter what I did, the quest automatically failed. For the most part, the armour visuals in the game were not to my taste. I found many of them too exaggerated, especially the higher end ones, and felt that they felt out of place with the game's tone. A number of other reviews have suggested multiple playthroughs, but I wouldn't suggest that. I played through it a second time andI felt that the story mode didn't have much more to offer after a single playthrough, as the results and quests played out the same, and the only difference would be something along the lines of a three sentence difference. And it appears to me that the major consequences all stem from the mass effect 3-esque decision you make at the game's end. I'm sure the game master mode would be a lot of fun, if I could find 3 other people willing to buy a $55 game. Also, you'll find yourself at a disadvantage if you create your own character, as much of the content revolves around using one of the characters the game has picked for you. If you do, you'll miss out on a number of quests and events in the game, making the experience less enjoyable.   Ultimately, if you ignore the ending, and you are willing to deal with a lot of the problems present in the game, I would buy it on sale. But if you don't want to put in hours after hours just for a major disappointing at the end, I would spend your money elsewhere."
48,Daniel,180,3,0,"October 16, 2017",Not Recommended,60.8,"At first, the game is captivating. But if you are looking into a more challenging difficulty, it becomes etxremely tedious to find viable builds that survive fights. Because of the mind-boggling decision of physical and magical armor, having a party of fighters and mages makes zero sense. Why should your mages you chew through 300 magic armor, when your fighters already melted down their physical armor, and vice versa. So you either go all fighters or all mages. And because of this, only a fracture of what is possible also makes sense. And I am not talking about over-optimization, I am talking about the minimum that is requried to have fun in combat. Unfortunately, the more you progress in the story, and the more spells you unlock, the more tedious the search of a good build becomes. And then make this times two or four, depending on how many party members you have.  But balancing is not only messed up in character creation and armor system. Thievery in Act I is the difference between making Honour Mode (the highest difficulty) unbeatable without, or a walk in the park if you start stealing armor and weapon from every vendor you come across. Another skill that feels like cheating is Teleportation, making it mandatory - together with Thievery.  I don't see the point in having literally hundreds of possibilites, where only a handful are actually fun. It only makes it tedious to find those exact combinations and not suck in every fight. And I got tired looking for them after Act I."

50,♥OVERKILL_Ashley♥,398,38,4,May 29,Not Recommended,120.0,"I really want to write a positive review for this game, so badly. I've never felt so conflicted on my feelings and my ""yes or no"" answer but right now i really can't suggest anyone buy this game.  Why? Well.. it's kind of not finished. Sure you have an ending but... if you're a ""normal gamer"" then you're not going to get to it due to horrific game design that seemed to be untested.  Simply put, the first act is pretty ""okay"" it's fairly balanced but a little dull due to lacking abilities that are interesting. Then act 2 is pretty open, there is a lot hidden and a lot going on, the theme of the game shines. You get new skills, story development and a fairly (most the time) balanced game. Act 3 then becomes oddly rushed.. with underwhelming endings to story arch and bizarrely easy fights. It's not the worst thing ever but it did make me feel a little concerned the game was losing direction.  Then i hit act 4.... oh boy... act 4... i.. i'm not too sure how to describe the car wreck that is act 4. Simply put, you start act 4 at level 19. The bosses and most of the enemies are level 20, which doesn't seem like a big deal... until you realize that the difference between that 1 level in gear is around... 200-300%. Yes... your items double/tripple in effectiveness from a single level. Unfortunately... you can't hit 20 without doing a number of quests in act 4... which results bosses just instantly killing your entire party in a single shot. I had a look online to see what the MLG pro gamers had for advice. The answers? Pretty much abuse flaws in the AI or bad balancing that helps you. There's no actual fair way to play act 4, you're supposed to abuse the game in order to progress. It's not something i want to do because i just don't think that's very fun.  Act 4 simply isn't anywhere near finished or even tested. Not only is the balance an utter mess, but so are the quests. Gone are your multiple options and dialogue with other npc's about your situation. Everything becomes a very finite line you MUST follow. A guy who got married on this exact day wants you to murder his new father in law, the ONLY way to finish it is to do it. Not tell his wife, not to get the local ""police"" involved, not even to mention why in his basement is effectively 30000 tonnes of this worlds equivalent of nukes. Just no, you're selling a product as if finished when it's clearly not. When act 4 is cleaned i will happily change my review.  And yes i know, people will tell me to git gud in response."

The characters are completely static in anything but plot points which they do move through, but without changing. They're also pretty much all boring archetypes, the rugged mysterious Mediterranean man, the psycho, the elitist smarty pants, the royal snob, the sottish person, etc. They never surprise you, every time they react to anything its always exactly what you expect that boring cliché to say. The story is extremely derivative, and seems like a plot a computer who copy and pasted plot elements from other famous RPGs like E. Scrolls and Drag Age could have come up with on its own. The dialogue choices are mainly about which piece of information you want to know in which order rather than actually role playing/having an effect. The only difference I really see is the game actually allows you to ♥♥♥♥ up if you kill a questgiver, which isn't that unique. I'm 29 hours in and still have yet to find what people see in this game that's so amazing, and I tend to go with the general opinion. Someone please explain what is so great about it?﻿"
53,bruticus0,12,15,0,"October 3, 2017",Not Recommended,123.9,"We've run into a game breaking bug.  After all the patches we've been through, a game breaking bug shouldn't be present.  My wife and I both have the game.  Our inventories have become messed up we think.  The only indicators we have are five blank spots when we go to Crafting inventory.  We have even tracked down where they come from.    During Driftwood, you have a quest, Strange Cargo, to rescue a guy in a barrel.  The moment you tell him to come with you, he becomes part of your party.  In his inventory are five grenade items.  No matter what you do after that, you will have blank spaces in your Crafting inventory.  Whether you kill him on the spot, or lead him safely out of town.  You might wonder what a few missing spots would matter.  As did we.  But when you get ready to leave Act2 and go to Nameless Isle, you'll either get kicked back out to the main menu during the cutscene, or get Crash to Desktop.  If you get kicked back out, it gives Save Error 302.  We haven't been able to get any attention on the issue.  But I suspect more people may realize having the same problem as time goes on and people progress through the story.  And they'll probably lose three days worth of progress like we did, and really really not even want to finish the game anymore.  So until this is fixed, or maybe even if it does, there's gonna be at least two negative reviews on this game from us."
54,Myzzy,235,14,3,"December 2, 2017",Not Recommended,133.6,"If you want a quality game without tons of random nuances, please buy the Divinty: Original Sin 1. This game butchered a lot of that game's charm, but quickly cut off its face and wore it around as a facade. Sourcery feels flat and weak, and almost entirely pointless at times due to it just being sucked out of you like nothing by most every enemy you come across (not to mention they're oftentimes weak and eat your AP like no tomorrow when you can do comparable damage or effects for the same amount AP). Some of the combat scenarios you will go through are also just tedious and can take upwards of an hour and a half per fight even when you are spending less than two minutes per character turn.  Slight Edit: The difficulties are also superficial in their differences. Tactician spouts on about in its description about how enemies have special effects and think more about their moves. In truth, the enemies have double your base stats: double vitality, phys. and magic armor, and quite often double your damage. They also commonly outnumber you meaning that you are up♥♥♥♥♥♥creek without a paddle. The first voidwoken you spot upon landing on the beach have ""vampire"" which lets them lifesteal damage they do. Some enemies have a bonus spell that 'spices' things up (usually a summon or something else of the sort that also has double your stats). It's not even a fair way to play the game, because you often have to abuse game mechanics and essentially cheat with quicksaves and quickloads to get anywhere. I am by no means a noob at this game either. I played a coop save with a friend in the first original sin where we both picked lone wolf, which rendered us locked to a two man party. We functioned as a team and got through the playthrough easy peasy as a first playthrough. That was a fair challenge. This game's difficulties are nothing more than jokes to play on people expecting a tactical difference in how the AI functions.  The biggest kicker, and the most apparent reason for my negative review is that the game is HORRIBLY optimized for Radeon cards. I have an AMD Radeon R9 Fury Sapphire and it absolutely begins to cook under the pressure of this game's coding. Within six minutes of starting the game, mind you this is only at the main menu, my graphics card's temperature jumps from 54 degrees Celsius to 72 degrees. Six minutes. On the menu. I have a water cooling system and near to seven fans in my PC that are all optimized to keep my tower as cool as possible. For comparison, I can play Doom on Ultra graphics at 1920x1080 resolution for hours without my PC trying to become an easy bake oven. The problem persists even on the lowest graphics settings as if it just wants to fry my GPU (once again, something that happens in no other game regardless of graphics settings). This game is absolutely a hog, and even the devs know it because they always talk about needing to remove peripherals from your USB or shutting off all non-essential programs. What is this: a pre-flight check-up? Just program your game better and give AMD cards a fair chance with optimization.  This problem is not just me either. Many other AMD users, based on community posts, support tickets, and forum posts, have had similar issues are just being flat-out unable to play the game because it crashes their graphics drivers. If you are an AMD user, avoid this game and buy its predecessor- a game you will enjoy far more. This might seem like pointless ranting, but as a consumer who has tested multiple things to adjust how this game functions. When I can't even play the game with my friends for more than a couple hours at a time (and at risk for damaging my PC) then this game has serious problems."
55,frederickhxu,101,62,9,"December 31, 2017",Not Recommended,81.9,"This is a heartbreaking negative review, but it is one that must be said. This game does not respect your time, or your agency as a player. The ending completely butchers the experience. Every choice you've made, every decision you went through, all the lives you save/lost, have no meaning in the game world in the end.  You have two choices in the end. One results in the world not changing at all, the other results in the world falling into chaos. Either way, you as a player have no control over any of it, and that's a damn shame.   Now, that being said, the glowing reviews do get 1 thing right: the first half of the game is quite uniquely done and is excellent. Acts 1 and 2 are excellent, I don't need to go into any real detail as all the glowing praise the game is receiving centers around those first two sequences.  Act 3 is generic, sluggish, and the combat is unfairly balanced towards the player (ironically). It's intended to be a filler act, but that's understandable. You get some nice lore revelations here, at least that saves this act.  Act 4 is horrible. It took what Act 3 did badly, and dragged it out. 20 hours of puzzles, hidden switches, locked doors, all for what? For predictable plot points. Things revealed in Act 2 and 3 and quest progression all play out exactly how you expect them to. A tedious and boring slog through an unfinished and rushed map. As for the combat, their effort to make it challenging results in cheap tactics. Bosses will always go first, and have large amounts of action points to spam spells endlessly and kill your party outright, and all throughout the act you will need to result in strange gimmicks to conclude fights.  One very positive thing though: The companion system and the character building is insanely well-done. If you are to buy this game, buy it for those companion quests. Very well done quests indeed. This is where the replay value lies, to experience the quests of the allies that you didn't get to adventure with the first time through.  As for the ending, I can't reiterate it enough. The game simply does not deliver. All the creative world building and world impact that you can make in Acts 1 and 2 are erased, and replaced with a generic blanket ending that will ultimately overshadow the adventure and leave you feeling dissatisfied. Even your companions are generically written in the ending.  What a damn shame. This is a game that was released unfinished. I suggest keeping this title in the back of your mind, and when they do release an Enhanced Edition that rectifies the problems that arose from (likely) rushed development, I will wholeheartedly recommend it.

I am not hating on the game, nor attacking, but expressing that I would not recommend it in its current state. Although, if you have any information that may compliment this game/solutions to included problems below, then I'll be more than happy to test those and alter this review accordingly  Now, you may expect the game to be flawless now that it's officially out of Beta, but there are some things completely askew; content is missing.  And, to some, that content can be extremely valuable if you like to immerse yourself into the world of Divinity.  Voice: Dialogue is missing in particular parts of the game with certain NPCs - even their portraits are missing.  There are sections within the game where the Narrator will say one thing, but the text will say otherwise.  (Narrator will say 'she/her' when the dialogue states 'he/his') During party conversations, one person's dialogue will be skipped completely and instantly followed up/replaced by another party member.  (In my experience, Ifan's voice would not be there, but Beast's voiceline would be spoken)  Loading Times/Party Play: Now you may have seen a lot of people complaining about this - but they are right; loading times are quite tacky as of now.  During Fort Joy, loading times were bearable - with a load time of roughly 3-5 minutes.  Although, as you progress, the duration gets seemingly longer; with times fluctuating anywhere between 9-20 minutes.  Keep in mind that loading times vary if you are playing solo, compared to multiplayer. Conclusion/TL;DR: Great game with a lot of potential.  It was released from Beta, in my opinion and experienece, too early.  If you are okay with missing content such as voicelines and misguided/incorrect text, accompanied by lengthy loading times, then this may be for you.  But for now, I would suggest waiting before making this purchase. "
59,Amitaya,156,100,7,"November 6, 2017",Not Recommended,121.8,"I'll split this into pro and contra and try to explain my negative aspects. The pro will be shorter because they don't need explanation.  The game is not for everyone. Many however will still like it. So if you are considering a buy, read the below points and ask yourself if they are important for you. I am a completionist. I tend to explore every nook and cranny and I like to manage equipment and skills in RPG's. I'm an old school RPG lover, always comparing classical RPG's to giants like Icewind Dale or Neverwinter Nights 2.  Pro  - Much heart was put into this project. There is love for detail which can be especially well seen in the area design and side quests.  - The music is, like in it's predecessor awesome.  - The diversity of spells and skills is impressive  - there are many secrets, hidden areas and treasure to be found everywhere  - The first act feels like the last game, it has a clear goal, you get a big area with sub areas to explore  - There are difficulty settings to adjust for different playstyles  - Modability is there and it's easy to mod or add already existing ones  - It's relatively bug free  - For an isometric RPG the graphics are really nice    Contra  - The UI: It's ok in the beginning, but later in the game you have to fight a war against cluttering of hundreds of small items with no availability of a search function. Item and craft UI feel half heartedly done and clumsy.  You don't even get nameable bags to put stuff in to sort it manually.  - Romances come late but then way too sudden. There is almost no personal idle banter and when they happen, it's like being forced into a relationship with someone you know nothing about, even while traveling with them the whole time. There is no additional remarks/chats/mentions/opportunities after you take a romance. You feel like being ""together"" with a robot. Also companions don't see/care what you do and with whom. You can romance all options and then, late pick one. Still no idle banter. No personal conversations at all.  - Bugs are few but the ones that are in can break your game or kill all your fun. (possible spoiler example below)  - After the first Act, the pace of the game slows down to a crawl. Instead of being able to chose areas to explore like in the grand RPG's of old: Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights, you get one freakingly huge area and are thrown in without much word of what to do and where to go. This paradigm stays until the end of the game. You don't get much info in your journal of what to do and where to go. You get the huge areas and can go explore all of it. The problem: you are expected to explore the places in the order Larian thought. But get no info on what order that is - apart from too hard (or too easy) enemies.  You can't simply take one single area and explore it as everything is connected and around every corner is another sidequest. Why do you do them you may end up asking yourself. The answer: to get the levels necessary to do your main quest. That's not roleplaying. That's powerleveling.  - Equipping new stuff is a horror: when the old item provided skill points that you used to learn and activate abilities, then on equipping something else you immediately deactivate all abilities your new gear doesn't allow you to wear anymore - without any warning. You then have to look through all the learned skills by yourself and find the ones that were deactivated. Becomes super annoying late game as there are easily a few hundred skills available.  - A few hundred skills is simply too much. It may be a nice idea to have freedom of using what fits the playstyle but with 30ish skills for every school (warfare, scoundrel, hunter and all 8(?) magic schools) and on top of that dozends of secret spell-combinations it's just overwhelmingly too much. - The main quest feels awkward to play. For most of the game I was uncertain if the story aims to force the player into some kind of Battle Royale with their friends. I quit the game at the last dungeon because I lost any interest in finishing it so I don't know if it indeed does. The feeling however, kinda ruined the atmosphere pretty good. And the companions did nothing you would expect in an RPG in such a situation. No long discussions about friendship/love/the right to live. They just say ""yeah, yeah later"". - The world Larian paints in this game is so ugly and imoral, that in the late game I was even considering of ending it for good. Whereever you look, you see discusting atrocities being done upon innocent people and beings. And not just from ""the bad guys"". Beggars torture their dogs, innocent and virtuous seeming (and presented, and behaving) girls who are first saved by you, turn into the next Hitler of their race and want to kill all intelligent life that is not of their race and ready their people for war. People (including your companions and yourself) seem to just shrug off the fact that they talk to mass murderers (your party). It's a cruel, dark, heartless and worthless world. Whatever ending one pursues, it's made clear by Larian that the world may change. But not the nature of it's inhabitants. Surely a completely different from what we saw in the brilliant Original Sin 1. - Riddles are really just time wasting unintuitive walls to make you google the solutions. They are not fun, not interesting and the bigger ones are annoying to handle. I just quit one after trying to solve it for 45 minutes. No hint. No reaction to what you do. No response to if you got something right or not. It just sucks and destroys all fun still left.   All in all I can't recommend this game to anyone who thinks my negative points would be important for them too. Else, enjoy. If all negative points are unimportant to you, this will be a great experience for you.       Example of fun killing bug  (POSSIBLE SPOILER - STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE GAME)               You have to try and get three source points in act 2. If you don't, then a certain NPC will help you out with that by sacrificing a part of their soul for you. In my game I had all three but the NPC did not recognize this. They still answered like I had not and sacrificed part of their soul. This lead much later to their demise.

It has tons and tons of side quests where you can make small, meaningless impacts on the world around you.  The game likes to play in the moral grey areas.

A fair bit of railroading, but done in a way that most people wouldn't notice -Game can be unstable, with random CTD during dialog -Quests are unnecesarily vague in many cases.  I'm all for a game not holding my hand, forcing me to gather clues from reading journals, talking to people, etc., but for many quests I hit a wall, and lost interest in continuing, hoping to stumble upon the next step. -Crafting system is inefficient, and dated.  The Bad: -Bugs galore, from quest-killers, dialog glitches, suicidal AI pathing, and quest log incoherence. -Combat system is clunky, sluggish, and punishes you for it's own flaws.   -Initiative system is terrible.  Watch as your character gets shuffled down in real time so you miss 2 whole turns before acting, despite having a stellar initiative score.   -Unlike a truly freeform game like D&D tabletop, your choices are dictated by the parameters of the game architecture, rather than a human GM.  This makes predicting the outcome of almost any decision you make difficult, even if something makes sense.  Save-scum often, which isn't that fun, and breaks immersion. -No confirmation system in iventory management, crafting, or bartering.  This adds a level of difficulty in tedium that is unnecessary.  It's like having to make DEX checks while trading so you don't sell the wrong item. -Artificial difficulty curve that takes away from the overall experience of the story, which isn't so great to begin with. -Lazy storytelling that makes me feel like I'm playing a mediocre D&D game with a novice DM. -Arx is so buggy, even post-update (10/8/17), it is an exercise in frustration that had me eager to just finish the game and get it over with. -As of today, final battle crashes mid-fight during second phase.  Tried it several times, but it is unplayable, which has killed my interest in what happens at the end.    Overall: 5/10       I can understand why this game is getting so many accolades, but I feel that there needs to be more objective reviews out here. It is unique in a very important way: Couch Co-op.  It's one of a tiny handful of games that my wife and I can play together, and for that, we are both having fun despite the myriad flaws present.  Also, I admire Larian Studios' passion and dedication to their work, which seems a rare commodity in today's game industry.   EDIT 10/8/17: Final battle is buggy, crashes, and isn't actually that well designed as far as final battles go.  Game overall is a glitch-fest, combined with lazy, forced game design.  I may recommend it when an enhanced edition releases a year from now and everything is ironed out."

67,Cryswar,218,30,4,September 5,Not Recommended,61.4,"Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle; despite the countless options the game wows you with even from fairly early on, the horrific game design makes a great many of approaches unplayable or pretty underwhelming.  The EXTREME overuse of enemy immunities is a big one - good luck trying to play a synergistic earth/fire caster when huge swathes of enemies are completely immune to most or all of what you can do with little to no warning - but don't worry, you can reload and respec and completely change your build to deal with them!  Hope you didn't bother bringing mixed physical and magical damage - enemies essentially have separate health bars for each type - making it ideal to bring pure magic OR physical damage (and in almost all cases it's vastly superior to just bring overwhelming physical damage). Don't worry, maybe you can have a buffbot caster - or just reload and respec for free with no downsides.  Hope you didn't want to roleplay each character having different social strengths and out of combat abilities - you never know when you're going to get dragged into an unskippable and unavoidable conversation that requires you to have high social stats to navigate successfully - but don't worry, you can just reload and respec to a social god, go and do it, and then respec back into being a thief or whatever!  While I am always in favor of respecs, making it completely free and without any downsides, at any point in the game, in a game that HEAVILY rewards specialization and defined roles, really rips apart any veneer of real player choice. It's not about going through a world, it just turns into a puzzle of deciding when to respec to automatically win one challenge and then respec again to beat the next.  There's also a wonderful modding community with a wide variety of intriguing mods to make the game harder/easier, add new classes, fix problems in the base game, add more monsters, and basically everything else to tailor your experience to be exactly as punishing or trivial as you want - but fortunately Larian knows best and ensured that a single mod disables all achievements because how dare those filthy modders try to alter their game!  The character interactions vary from hilariously terrible to genuinely interesting and were among the brightest points in the game; there is some excellent writing that does a lot to help you get into the head of each character (vengeance-driven elvish assassin, snarky egotistical undead, hardcore grizzled mercenary, etc) while allowing you to twist those personalities in ways that fit the character but align with your vision of them; the Elf is never going to be a chill person but you can turn her into a relentless hate-fueled machine of death who slaughters anyone who ever wronged her, a laser focused woman only concerned about the few people who truly deserve her vengeance and doesn't hurt others unnecessarily, or anything in between.  I especially enjoyed how each player character in coop can react to things differently and further their own storyline, but if you don't discuss it with your coop partner it can get pretty awkward at times, especially if they just happened to trigger a major plot event that you have no say in until after they aggro'd everything on the map. Or if you accidentally trigger a cutscene that you simply don't have the social or perk-based tools to handle appropriately. Or if one of you accidentally misclicks and aggros half the city.  The recent Definitive Edition update professes to make the execrable plot slightly better and 'rebalances' the game - by nerfing power combos into the ground and giving tiny buffs to skills that were comically bad before and are generally still comically bad now. Doesn't deal with any major design flaws, unfortunately, just dunks on SOME of the best combos while ignoring others and not actually giving a damn about underwhelming options.  This game definitely has heart and while I am forced to give it a thumbs down based on steam's binary system, in reality I would probably give it closer to a 5 or 6 out of 10. maybe as high as 7 if you're willing to overlook some of its flaws. It's not a TERRIBLE game by any means. But it's no Baldur's Gate or anything close - a lot of glossy paint over a rotting veneer, with a major subsection of the community among the more toxic and elitist individuals I've met in my time of online gaming and forum discussion. DoS2 is enough of an improvement over DoS1's horrific missteps that it gives me a little hope that DoS3 might actually be a genuinely good game, but the tripe of this Definitive Edition doesn't do a lot to give hope."

70,Skarn,397,55,7,June 24,Not Recommended,121.0,"This review contains spoilers.  I'm an avid BD / IWD fan so i was excited for Divinity 2, after beating it, I can say that divinity has elements of a great game but has many fundamental problems that destroy the experience for a typical player, I played this game with my other half and I'd highly recommend not playing this game with more then a single player, I'll get into why later in my review.  Lets start with what makes divinity good: the story, lore, characters are all very rich, there is a lot to explore, every NPC is fully voiced and the world is beautifully crafted. There is a delight in finding hidden goodies and being rewarded for really taking your time to search through each area.   Divinity excels in and out of combat, and the first 2 parts (islands) of the game are a masterpiece. Fights are balanced and your party feels like they are able to handle most encounters without the game ever feeling unfair. There is fun to be had everywhere, NPCS are interesting to talk to and there are many off the beaten path quests that will make you laugh out loud, make you feel genuine sadness and sometimes infuriate you at a game character. Last but not least is the puzzle elements, there are some great small puzzles to be done as well as a handful larger puzzles that make you feel great for solving them.  As the first 2 parts (islands) are so well crafted it makes the cracks in the second 2 parts (islands) that much more obvious. The third part of the game is very story-lite and feels like filler, it was extremely tedious with some key story characters thrown in for good measure to make the story tick along. Combat for the first time in the game was incrediablely easy, there were no challenging fights and nothing that tested our group of merry adventurers, which was different to the first 2 parts. It's important to note that part 3 is filler for a point later.  Despite the above, the third part of the game is mediocre/boring but still playable. The fourth part of the game is however a train wreck. Many of the quests are linear, with no objective thinking, fights are not balanced with many ""HAH GOTCHA"" mechanics put in place, only a select few standout puzzles (which were all too common in part 2) and quite frankly there are so many things trying to happen at once that it's a bit of a mess.   The story in part 4 falls apart with so many elements chucked in place that the finale of the game for me personally was A) ruined and B) hollow, part 4 of the game suffers from filler content like in part 3, but to the extent that nothing is interesting, as a player I stopped caring about the objective i was being set because the game was throwing the kitchen sink at me, so much of the content had felt ham-fisted and boring compared to the finesse of part 2 that I'd lost all emotional investment in the game that the first two parts had worked so hard to build. The game had simply gone on to long for me to care anymore, it would of benefited from removing part 3, and overhauling part 4 to be better paced and run a longer length to create a grand finale.   Part 4 also suffers from the ham-fistedness in the difficulty department with fights ranging from silly easy to ""cheese""to beat for a party that was not power gamed on NORMAL difficulty. The final fight of the game, I had to make a different choice simply because 1 of the 2 options was ridiculously hard, just because the game would 1 shot party members 2 levels higher despite my party being okay through most other fights (other then a few that were obviously overtuned, I'm looking at you doctor.)  The above is further made worse with the biggest problem of all: This game is a buggy mess.  I understand that nothing works 100% of the time, sometimes a game crashes, sometimes a quest is bugged. This wasn't the case for me throughout Divinity 2, about half way through part 2 of the game, every time I played, I ran into one of the many bug related issues listed below, shattering my immersion and often garnering my frustration at the game.  Bug 1: Save games lagging & causing the game to crash for either myself or other player. Divinity 2 has a limit on how many saves it can create, eventually causing the game to have immense lag, you have to fix this by managing your saves... why? I'm not here to manage save game files, I'm here to hammer the quick save button incase one of the many quests bug out.. which leads me to....  Bug 2: Quest bugs, this happened so many times where a quest wouldn't trigger or close or have part X fire properly, meaning time would be wasted online to find a workaround or whether I could continue on with the game, I ended part 2 of the game with 4 side-quests still open because they simply ""didn't close"".  Bug 3: *MAJOR SPOILER*: Cutscenes don't work in multiplayer, the final cutscene of the game was not shown to me because I did not ascend, so whilst the other player got to see the cut scene we'd played over 100 hours for, i was left on the ship twiddling my thumbs waiting, RUINED the ending of the game for me, I've never been angrier at a bug.  Bug 4: Inventory becomming locked, so many times this happened, where the main characters inventory would lock and no longer allow me to access it, forcing a game restart, frustrating as the game takes 2 minutes to load, and a further 2 minutes to get the other player in, this happened every playthrough in part 4.  Bug 5: Non-party leader members don't integrate into story, probably the most immersion destroying bug is that during the game, some party members will ""step"" into the spotlight to have their say should the party leader let them, but the second players characters never do this other than in moments for those character core quest lines. Player ones ifan would constantly step in and dialogue but player twos red prince and beast would never interject in a conversation and thus felt like tag alongs rather than party members.  Bug 6: Spells not working, sometimes spells would not hit their target despite a clear arch to hit an enemy, often this would been we'd need to target a different body part or some such, without the character or target moving.. ridiuclous.   In summary, Divinity 2 has great elements but I think it's unfinished and very rushed in areas, it's in dire need of bug fixing and re-writes, I wanted to love this game but I couldn't be happier that I've beaten it so I can see the back of it, a frustrating experience in the end and a wasted potential for something that could stand shoulder to shoulder with the old greats."
71,Berserker Queen,87,No,0,October 30,Not Recommended,54.7,"Mixed Review, If I could. The game has been thoroughly praised, so I'll quickly focus on the shortcomings: the combat and the story.   The combat, despite surprisingly innovative in the isometric RPG genre, is clunky and repetitive, as the armor system gimps crowd control and pushes you towards a non-mixed party. Besides, it's unbalanced. For players used to the genre, Classic difficulty allows you to steamroll everything, while Tactician's difficulty forces you to both milk the looting and stealing system to it's ultimate maximum, so as to empower yourself as much as you can, and cheapening every battle possible, like engaging people from the UBER IDEAL angle with the UBER IDEAL positioning, which ruins immersion and roleplay. The game perfectly shows how something new or different isn’t necessarily something better.  The story, from its part, is entirely monotonous. It’s one thing to be an important character, it’s another to be the Alpha and Omega to extents in which secondary characters and personal stories from absolutely unrelated people either serve only to make you more alpha and omega or are entirely cast aside. The straw on the camel’s back for me, was, first, *spoilers* the woman who destroys the initial ship being easily killed in a senseless fight and then the seekers on the island being absolutely erased after the end of Chapter 2. Characters and developments are absolutely forgotten and swept aside – the important part, the game never ceases to remind you, is that you’re the Divine. ♥♥♥♥ everything else.  Now, the graphics are gorgeous and detailed, the music and sound effects are immersive, if not entirely memorable, the animations are fun and varied and they really showed us a whole new way of fighting in a medieval fantasy setting – but if combat end up being a chore and the writing is bland, the game just isn’t fun."
72,Nogan,125,24,2,April 2,Not Recommended,46.2,"I kept hearing this game being touted as the best RPG ever made, so I checked it out. Not to say that it's a bad game, because IT ISN'T, but I was disappointed. Seems that it was described that way by the sorts of people whose favorite aspect of ""RPGs"" is discovering new builds and squeezing the best possible numbers out of them. It actually functions very similarly to Skryrim in that way, as it exists as a sort of sandbox for players to experiment with builds while ignoring the story until they get bored and try a different one.  If you're looking for a game with a compelling story, I don't think you'll find it here. It's pretty forgettable and was obviously thrown in as an afterthought. Again, this is the sort of RPG built for metagamers. In the sake of allowing that openness, you aren't hampered in your endeavors by anything but the level of the enemies you encounter. For instance, Fort Joy is described as a ghetto where you're kept under thumb by a group of militant radicals, where the prisoners have set up their own gangs and attempt to run things under the radar. But you're never accosted by your jailors. You're never confronted by Gangs of New York inspired Griff. You just do your own thing and run around the fort like you own the place. It never imparts the sense of genuine strife.  If you're looking for a game with tight tactical combat, I don't think you'll find it here, either. Combat is turn based and off grid. Means characters have very little physical presence and everyone can just squeeze by each other. Also means that there's no real advantage to be gained from positioning. AoE spells fall where they may because everyone is rooted to the ground while its someone else's turn, and there aren't any good methods of herding or aggroing enemies to keep them still while your mage rains down powerful spells.  Speaking of spells, class abilities are pretty homogenized, so everybody gets powerful recovery, AoE, mobility, and debuffing options. Class identity has been sacrificed in the name of customization, which I'm sure many find appealing, though I personally find it detracts from the meat of the gameplay.  The last issues I have rest with itemization. All the equipment you find is based on item level, which is based on character level. The difference between items one level apart is significant. Equipment two or more levels below the current level of your character might as well not even exist. The damage you do and the damage you can take is almost entirely based on item level. It means that any equipment you find is going to be rendered useless in about an hour, which is frustrating. And more than that, the problem lies with ARMOR.  Armor is, by far, the single biggest issue with combat and levels in this game. Armor effectively stops characters from being effected by any number of the overpowered statuses. It stacks up and goes down like health as you do/take damage. Once you're armorless, you're defenseless against them. So why is this an issue? The amount of armor you can stack is heavily tied to the level of armor you're using. Because the level of armor the enemies use is tied to their level, it means that character level is the most important factor in deciding where you can go and what you can do. There's no cheating out unlikely victories against higher level encounters, because you have to smack each other until the armor goes away before you can actually influence combat in any reasonable way. This effectively means that the game holds your hand as it walks you to from encounter to encounter that you're currently allowed to beat. No strategy. No tactics. Just numbers.  All in all, it wasn't the sort of RPG that I was looking for. I don't think most of these points are negatives so much as they're descriptions of what to expect. The strategy you'll find in this game is derived from how you feel like building your character, rather than in the encounters themselves. Basically, it's ""do I want to make a stealth archer or tanky mage"" rather than ""there are multiple archers across that gap, how do I want to tackle this particular encounter"". I don't personally enjoy RPGs like that, so I didn't find a lot here that I cared for."
73,Squirmonkey,192,36,8,July 23,Not Recommended,94.6,"Wow. I played the Fort Joy section of this game, and I was blown away. The combat was excellent. The storytelling was immaculate. Not a bug or glitch in sight.  And then I finished the Fort Joy chapter, and you know what? Every other part of this game completely sucks. Plotlines that make no sense, or don't resolve in the right order. Massive ""open"" areas which have to be tackled in a specific order or else result in certain death. Nonsensical combat scaling which forces you to spend hours using the disgustingly-fiddly inventory manager every time you level up. A completely pointless crafting system, which I'm sure contains hundreds of recipes that there's no way to learn but will have you carrying dozens and dozens of ingredients you have no clue what to do with. Quests designed in such a way that I spent half my time on the wiki looking up what arcane unnanounced skill check I was failing. A combat system that shows everything it has to offer in the first few levels and then falls off thanks to poor scaling, a lack of new abilities, the exceptionally un-fun source mechanic, and abilities that straight up don't do what they're supposed to (I'm looking at you, Mad and Taunted).   I was really excited after the first chapter. However, after that chapter the game devolves into a total mess which I wanted to love and can't recommend."
74,Bob1004,149,54,4,"September 19, 2017",Not Recommended,43.3,"This game is maddening. But let's get the positives out of the way: The game has a great world and characters. I liked being part of the world. Magic is powerful and elemental combinations can be interesting. Normally I would consider this a good game and would heartily recommend it. It is a mechanically sound experience.  BUT  The game is a damned mess in execution. Bugs are ever present. And these are not graphical glitches. Quests conclude totally ignoring what you did in them. Not sure that it affects gameplay, but it is confusing to see it write the exact opposite of what you did into the journal.  But the biggest issue is that the game is unforgivably obtuse and lacks any structure in its story. I don't as much follow what is going on as stumble from one event to another, sometimes having dialogue options that I have no idea who it references or what is going on. There is absolutely no structure to the story. There are also nothing but vague hints on what are you supposed to do. This game made me rage quit an RPG, which has never happened before: After spending hours on the Nameless Island in front of a bloody gate that I have no idea how to open and only vague notions of where to proceed. This game explains nothing. Gives no hints where you are supposed to go or what to do. You just explore every corner of the map and occasionally things happen. I don't expect it to be a linear corridor, but I do expect story progression, not stumbling in the dark until something happens. I literally have no idea what am I supposed to do or where am I supposed to go. The journal itself is useless beyond recording (sometimes incorrectly) past events. It is absolutely possible to accidentally pass crucial plot details and have no idea what the bloody hell is going on. That is not 'freedom', it's bad story telling.  Also, I'm not invested in the actual story at all. You have to become Divine. Why? Because the game is called Divinity. This is just what Godwoken do on a Thursday I guess. Again, not sure because the story is lackluster or because I accidentally skipped half of the story by going into a cave.  Ultimately I'm not having fun. I'm increasingly confused and agitated by the game as it refuses to adhere to any structure. The opening was great, I had fun exploring the first islands, but everything is downhill from there. I wanted to like this, but when a game makes you yell profanities at the screen for 15 minutes, then it is no longer entertainment.  After playing this game, I can see that 'total freedom' is absolutely overrated and a terrible narrative device. Compare it to an Obsidian or Bioware RPG: Each is more restrictive and linear, but I have a grasp on what is going on, who the players are, etc. Hell, this game cannot properly remember that I choose one of their prebuilt characters, only adding to further confusion when it references events in dialogue that did not happen. Or when one character tells the other that it was not there somewhere where it absolutely was. Or when characters appear out of thin air with altered personality.  It is a mechanically sound narrative mess. And since I'm primarily interested in the narrative, I cannot with a good conscious recommend it."
75,Kabooozie,15,4,1,May 20,Not Recommended,90.2,"I enjoyed this game for about 100 hours, so it's hard to say I can't recommend it. It has many pros: -clever writing -great narration -a truly D&D experience where your abilities can interact with the world in interesting and unexpected ways -some truly difficult, satisfying combat  But. The game is imbalanced, and drags on way too long. There are intense difficulty spikes even on normal diffuculty where, despite being overleveled, encounters feel unfair. This happens especially at the beginning if you don't know exactly what order to do quests to gain XP. I once fought some level 2 frogs for an hour and a half and didn't get anything. Many of the systems are just obtuse and outdated. This game does not subscribe to modern, streamlined, meaningful design. There is so much of the game that just wastes your time."
76,KD6-3.7,31,4,0,"October 15, 2017",Not Recommended,133.3,"Is this a good game? Yes (if you like turn based RPG of course) Is this better than the first? I would say no.  If I had to summarize : +the game is beautiful, you can clearly see that the designers were inspired +the story of the firt act is really good   -the armor system is frustrating, since it encourages raw damage over control, at higher difficulty this really limits the number of good builds. A single point remaining in an armor (for you or your ennemy) can change the outcome of a combat, not really fun -for example ranger/sniper doesn't really work at higher difficulty (all ennemies have some sort of TP), and invocation is terrible -mages have basically to specialise in one scool to be efficient -two handed weapons is heavily favored for now, you can solo the game in tactical difficulty with a solo 2-handed warrior  -many things that worked in the first divinity original sin has been nerfed : crafting is more or less useless outside of runes, changing surfaces on the ground is sub-optimal (enemies like to put everything on fire, forget about poison and oil), etc  -initiative is only useful on one team number since there will be an alternance between your team and foes (hate the new system)  -the worst flaw of the game is the very weak act 3 (the last one) if you ask me (no spoil, but it is the worst of the three and the shortest) -act 3 has by far the most translation's errors of the three, it feels rushed (for example description in the place of the name of the object and name in the place of the description or two times the same sentences in dialogue, not really funny) -act 3 is also I think the one with the more bugs, at least it feels like it  So basically I am frustrated, it is quite a good game, but it feels not nearly as complete as the first. The end is rushed, the combat's mechanic is heavily damage oriented (forget about surfaces and such, it makes basically no damage and no control), and your life is basically useless, only armor really count (at least on tactical difficulty).  I don't know, it could have been so much better than I can't recommend it right now."

While the game is evidently made by talented people with passion for their work, I did not enjoy it much. Audio/visual side of things, this game is gorgeous, and combat is fun and engaging, but can get a little tedious. Voice acting top notch. But the game on whole is a slow slog, with the most cliched high fantasy setting and dull story. Ye that allows for some funny scenarios, but it's not at all immersive and the world/map is so condensed and level scaled, that is similar to MMORPG only 50 times smaller. I mean you happen upon a ravaged caravan, and have to bring news to city guard 20 meters away, it's all silly, like they could not hear or see giant voidwoken worms attacking it. They should just do more maps and let them breathe a little and not filled them to the total brim with quest/secrets/enemies etc. Would improve exploring/adventure vibe.

It is VERY slow moving. Forget that it's turn based, forget playing with 1 character, and forget rushing into ANY fight. It's slow - almost awkwardly so. I would say at least 90% of playing is dialogue play. There is very little combat, and I think this was on purpose. Combat is meant for playing with a full party - and even then it is VERY difficult to win without thoroughly understanding the mechanics. Unfortuantely, you don't get much practice to get familiar with them so that the fights are even enjoyable. I've wiped my entire party on every fight except the Voidwoken(overgrown maggots). I just cannot bring myself to put this on easy difficulty.       Unfortunately, the dialogue and how the story was delivered wasn't enough to keep me playing. And even then, I'd say the story telling is mediocre at best. It's simply not compelling enough to keep at it. I tried playing several times before I just got frustrated, read similar reviews, got bored then just uninstalled. It is a beautiful game with a lot of attention to detail, however, it just doesn't do enough to keep your normal RPG guy playing. For this reason, I'm going to have to go with a ""Do not recommend"" on Steam. Very sad."

The game's only plus in my view is its insame difficulty in combat which in our times seems popular where some people think playing extremely difficult games requiring an insame amount of time makes them something special. I think it's ridiculous, it's annoying like hell.

80,NaniCat,124,29,8,February 27,Not Recommended,264.0,"I've played this game a good bit, and while on some levels I enjoy it. I think the reality of it is that I WANT to enjoy it far more than I do. The game has a rich environment, and great game feel that takes me back to the 'good ole' days' of playing baldurs gate and icewind dale and the like, however... there's some seriously massive problems with the game; Namely, Balance and Diversity.  When I say Balance, the game has been scaled horribly, a good example is warfare, being... the end all be all for literally any physical damaging characters, INCLUDING necromancer. playing a rogue? max warfare, playing a ranger? yup... max warfare... All of this becomes even more problematic when you include issues with the other big problem; Armour and Resistances.  The twist of the knife is that they seperated armour into magic armour, and physical armour; meaning that enemies (and players) essentially have 3 health pools, while different effects are resisted by different armor pools, these pools must be diminished to get into the juicy meat of the quintessential problem. not only is magic simply inherently worse because of the otherwise RANDOM elemental resistances enemies have, meaning that your fire mage may end up useless in some situations, your melee and physical damage dealers will encounter almost no issues (only one is an otherwise exploitative style 'bug' (feature?) of a few key enemies using an evasive aura that gives them and all their allies a 90% chance to dodge, it's quite stupid).  So, this means two things, A. having a split damage type group means you're effectively doubling your enemies health/armour pools, and B. many builds are completely dysfunctional because of poor scaling mechanics and skill sets affecting your abilities in nonsense ways, The witch is a great example of this ( a starting character class that is little more than a noob trap) as daggers scale with finesse, necromancer abilities scale with intelligence, and all their physical damage scales with... warfare.   For the more than 200 hours i've played in this game, I can say I enjoyed some of the game, but I can also say that due to bugs, poor game design for multiplayer co-op (I laid on the ground dead due to a bug while the end of the game cutscene went for my friend and i got to see none of it, it was an absolutely awful experience). I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME, but sadly, it needs a serious rework of the fundamental principles that it's based on before it could potentially be any actual good."
81,Kasarian,233,3,1,May 8,Not Recommended,21.6,"This is another ""wish there was neutral button"" review. It's also going to compare this game to the first one alot.  Pros: -Story telling (mainly sidequests) and interactions in the team you assemble (and personal quests of 6 premade characters) are SO much better than in first game, there are a lot of quests and less generic npc's but... -Both character creator and later thanks to readily available respec option you can build any character you want, in this aspect the game is bit more open minded than first one but... -Visually the game is pretty, same with music though...  Cons: -... that same storytelling has pacing problems. There are 5 chapters and with ending of 4th act it suddenly dies in my opinion. SPOILER It's typical ""you almost got the objective of the story to be snatched from your hands"" and you're thrown into another bug map with urgency that world is going to hell... but at the same take your time and go about exploring another map. -...but while you have a lot of leeway on how to build your character (and 3 companions)  I simply hate, HATE how suddenly Abilities were separated into Combat and Civil with points to the second being scarcely given out so you can't really have a Civily oriented character (and how Persuation is absolutely NEEDED for any interesting outcome) and Combat abilities being such a god damn MESS that your character you want to build for SCOUNDREL will be better off first  maxing out WARFRARE to deal more damage... (not to mention choosing perk, something I couldn't wait for in first game,  is just choosing an option which does NOT suck) -Combat and overall difficulty is a f***ing joke, not even taking in to the account the bonuses/debuffs to health/armor they present. As an example: In 5th act there is a small boss fight with one character specific quest, there is the boss and 6'ish minions Explorer - my level 20 characters equipped fully with Divines and Unique items steamrolled the fight so hard it's not even funny, abilities of enemies were hardly used and they just walked up to me to get themselves killed. Classic - By the time it my 1st character could move 1 character was already dead, one was about to join him and other 2 were heavily debuffed... There is a difference between AI is braindead  at half health and AI is going to bury you under the amount of debuffs and status effects before it's your turn. But maybe it's just me. -Item generator in this game is absolute garbage. If you don't fancy multiclassing your party (which the game actively encourages to the point it feels you're being pushed into it) finding ANYTHING that will suit your characters build is a god damn MIRACLE, oh and that nice item you DID find/buy? You throw it out the bloody window cause next level it is GARBAGE and crafting is... just there. I think this game has one ot THE worst item scalings I EVER played. -Ending is trash. It's on the level of pre-dlc Mass Effect 3 to me with an added option that no matter what you do everybody is ♥♥♥♥ed (Rivellon) or your companions/npc are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unhappy about your choice (and it's presented in a way as if it's your fault and you should've chosen better...) not to mention a lot of last fight reveals (the fight itself is  pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tery) are just a joke...   TL;DR - game in MY opinion upgrades a lot of stuff upon first game but simply f***s up the stuff that was actually pretty good in first one. If you have a question about something this review didn't cover or want to expand comment, also this is my marginal opinion so take it with a grain of salt."

While the combat and stats are simplified and dumbed down, that alone wouldn't be enough for me to give the game a negative review. The key problem for me is the sheer unlikabilty of virtually every character in the game. They don't feel like people at all, none of them seem to have any real issues they care about, even the NPCs with you that have life changing events over their heads give up on them with a single easy persuasion check. It doesn't help either that half of the NPCs you meet seem to be smug and insulting of the party, not in a funny way either, but in a ""Hey guys look at this cool guy who'll guide you through the game"" kind of way. It doesn't help that a massive number of characters are introduced by showing you up in text, such as putting a knife to your throat or invading your space in some other way. In short, the npcs in this game seem to drive it instead of the players, and many seem to have a self important mary sue vibe. It really killed my ability to get in to the game as a whole."
84,Mendhak,487,7,0,"November 8, 2017",Not Recommended,146.8,"Backed as part of the Kickstarter campaign, had been hoping for more of what made the first D:OS memorable.  Unfortunately for me this isn't what D:OS2 was like, it was more serious and the joviality of the first was gone, giving it a somewhat generic feel.  I also wasn't a fan of the 'refined' surface mechanic - I realized this when I found myself standing in a 'cursed electrified blood cloud', it was now dancing into the realm of ridiculous.  It was similar for the additional source mechanic, it just didn't click with me - towards the middle of the game, the combat began to feel like a chore.    The serious tone of the game made the towns and cities completely dull.  And while a great amount of detail had been paid to the beginning of the game, the middle and ending of the game as well as the story felt a bit rushed and loose in terms of focus; as did certain quests, which seemed to be completely missing any context or information.    Some parts are pretty good though - the soundtrack is memorable, a bit broodier and darker than the first, though I am listening to it on repeat now and hoping to buy it soon.  There are plenty of spells to pick and choose from, though it is hampered by the enforced AP limit.  The story was... just-ok, if a bit tedious.  Performance wise, I was getting a steady 120+ fps at most places.  The artwork and level design are just great - there's a lot of detail in every place you visit.  So there was enough to somewhat keep the interest going for the sake of finishing.    Overall - decent but not seeing the accolades, good art and music carrying a dull story.  It didn't bring back the charm of D:OS, so if I were speaking to my past self, would not have recommended."

To begin, I'd like to say this game's lore and concept are fantastic, I would recommend it fully for those things. There are, however, a ton of gameplay mechanics that are eh and make fights tedious and unfun, but those can easily be overlooked if you really play for the story. No, those aren't the issue.  The bugs are the problem. Countless, mindblowing, ridiculous bugs. I feel like I paid for an early access game, but it's not in early access anymore, and I bought it full ♥♥♥♥ing price. You have no idea how many odd things I've had happen. I'm not talking about bugs that you notice right away and just reload 5 minutes ago to fix-kinda thing, not wall clipping sillyness (Though there's some of that as well).  I'm talking:  -""Oh look that npc never prompted me for his quest so now I'm locked from one of the things that had me most curious and to fix that I'd have to reload 20-30 hours of gameplay ago"",  -""Oh look I somehow have a 5th party member when the limit is meant to be 4, but that 5th npc can't really act and is attacked by all allied npcs, and there's no way to get rid of it"".  -""Oh look because I used another one of the game's many options of approach (which is a really cool thing in theory) the story's all ♥♥♥♥ing backwards"" -""Oh look I killed the boss before he could transform into his ""true"" form, removing the discussion prompt that I'm supposed to get from finishing that, guess I ain't finding out what happens next with that...""  Last but not least: I just finished the final fight, but my main character died right before and I didn't get to resurect him, so the other characters get the final choices in the game...okay that's fine I guess...  BUT WAIT! Then, after the cinematic regarding that choice, there's only my main character left and I guess there's a bit of game left to play (new game+ kinda thing, perhaps?) but since he died in the last fight and all the other party members are gone, I get a game over prompt, allowing me to either load a previous save (before the final fight) OR just go to main menu.   TL;DR: Game's story's pretty good. Mechanics are nothing revolutionary, sometimes annoying but mostly bearable, bugs completely ruin immersion and make me not recommend the game in it's current state."
87,bogbrush3,52,55,13,"November 5, 2017",Not Recommended,117.2,"There are a lot of people that rave about this game, and to be fair there are a lot of positives to it. The combat is very satisfying, the writing is good and the storyline is alright. I like the character creation and customisation through the game, and the ability to customise the Origins characters is a really good addition.   However, none of that is enough to make up for the hours you will spend pixel hunting, reading through online walkthroughs and sifting through inventory screens with no search function and the most awkward 'sort by' system imaginable. There is a skill you learn to be able to see ghosts, but it is hardly ever hinted when you need to use it (even to finish quests), and at one point you even need to use it to see levers which is literally never mentioned and never happens again in the entire game. The questlog is equally illogical, and essentially tells you what you have already done without giving you any idea where to go next, and the waypoints on the map seem like they were put in the game by someone who has not read the plot. Sometimes, you are encouraged to explore with amazing loot as rewards, but other times without any notification at all you can go too far and come back to a town to find half the people dead and quests uncompleteable. In fact, I only found out those people should have been alive because I read it on an internet walkthrough after the fact.  A lot of people praise this game as a throwback to the golden age of RPGs in the 90s and early 2000s, and I get that. But for me, some aspects of gaming have moved on - I dont want to walk around in circles looking for an item that no longer exists because I chose the wrong option in dialogue 3 weeks ago and the quest didnt update. What specifically irks me is that before I bought the game I researched it, and in an interview one of the devs claimed they had made it all but impossible to miss quests by going the wrong way or doing the wrong thing - and in my opinion that is just bull****.  There are people that will mistake this frustration for the game being difficult - it isn't. Once you get a hang of the game mechaincs and level up enough to get decent skills there are very few fights that pose any kind of threat even on the hardest difficulty. What it is is time-consuming, frustrating and illogical unless you want to follow the one-dimensional path the game devs set out for you into a trap that is obvious from the middle of act two, if not earlier.  In my opinion you should just watch a playthrough on Youtube instead of buying it, and if after that you still are interested at least wait until it is on sale - because you are going to need that money to buy a new screen after you smash a hole in your old one."

But I do not like being forced into doing most if not all side quests just to be able to progress. In some of the Witcher games, and Fallout I have done a majority of the side quests, but that is because I choose to, not because I have to. In this game if I do not do the side quests, I can simply not progress through the main content due to being too low level. Seems every step of the main story progressions saw me having to go back and complete side quests so I had a chance of being able to progress.  If you are someone that loves doing all the side quests, then this game may well be a game you will enjoy, but if you are someone that likes just pushing through the main story line, I can not recommend this game."
89,vegan meth,329,18,0,"September 23, 2017",Not Recommended,103.5,"This is the best concept for an RPG ever made in my opinion. However I can not recommend it due to it being largely unfinished. It follows the same trend of Tyrrany in that the beginning of the game is vast and interesting, but once you get to the final acts everything falls apart. Constantly being forced to reload the game due to conversations bugging out, quests bugging out, combat turns bugging out, and pretty much anything else you can imagine just not working at all completely ruins the great writing and amazing gameplay mechanics. Have a character with high persuasion? Oh that is your main character? Too bad. Random peons in your group will constantly be addressed for major dialogue options, forcing you to fail the conversation, and either reload the game or just be forced to kill all of the npcs. There was even a time during one of the hardest fights in the game where I won the fight with 200 hp remaining on my final living character after an hour long fight, just to have the game bug out and prevent any further action. An hour long epic battle reduced to pointlessness. You can expect this to happen constantly. This game is worth $20 max.

I really liked the first one and expected to like this one too, but something just feels off about it despite the obvious depth and quality and the adorable quirky characters.  I don't like how it controls at all. It's so easy to misclick and steal stuff or attack someone you didn't mean to or make the characters walk straight through the fire when you obviously didn't mean to either. I am also not a fan of the first area being overloaded with boss encounters. They tend to produce very random fights that lead to save scumming.   In fact, most of the encounters seem to be designed around save scumming and cheesy strategies, particularly in the ""Tactician"" mode. They are straight up unbeatable unless you know exactly what to expect from the encounter and you do things like precast spells, position your characters in a certain way for that specific encounter or put barrels around the area where you know the enemy is going to appear *before* you trigger it.  But what I really hate is the armor system. Every character has two armor bars, magical and physical. They are pretty much additional HP bars that absorb damage from physical and magical attacks correspondingly before you can affect the actual HP. This is fine on its own, however you can't apply any physical effects (stuns, knockdowns) while the target still has some physical armor and you can't apply any magical effects (slowed, burning etc.) while the target still has magical armor.  What that means is that for a good part of the fight you effectively can't use any skills and are forced to stick to basic attacks until the armor is gone. This system is easily the least fun armor system I've ever seen in an RPG."

I have 150 hours in game and that's just one playthrough with Fane on a tactician difficulty while trying my best to complete everything, discover all quests, secrets, achievements and locations.   I have started playing on release and finished the game on the latest patch and i can say that it remains one of the most bug ridden games i have ever encountered on par with Fallout and Elder Scrolls.   In every act there are numerous quests which do no close or register upon completion correctly. There are broken npc's which do not progress quests correctly or even board your ship when they supposed to. Broken items which do no have any description or can't be used or have broken interactions. Broken achievements. Missing sounds and dialogues. Dead npc's reappearing later on or being addressed is if they are alive or alive npc's appearing dead. Bugged, broken, missing, wrong - that's the current state of the game. Even one of the endings for Fane was broken which is simply unacceptable and should be the very least that they could've fixed by now. Not to mention chat which never worked since the release.    What's even worse is that every bug has been documented both on larian and steam forums, there are threads upon threads detailing and repeating almost all of the bugs i have encountered in the game and some of the threads are from 2016 and 2017.   While the game has amazing graphics, music, good story, a lot of choices, puzzles and genuinely addictive gameplay - the lack of QA is truly astonishing.   I realize that partially it's my own fault since im a completionist and prefer to explore every nook and cranny and up until the ending i was still going to write a positive review but when i was unable to use the ending that i wanted all along i decided that it was enough.

94,FBWilson,115,16,4,July 16,Not Recommended,68.0,"This is like Divinity 1 but with some aspects much better and some aspects much worse. The combat is good and I like the addition of source points even if it makes some skills which you could use freely in the first game require additional resources to use.  HOWEVER, the biggest problem with the game is that it cheats. I don't mean it's hard, because it isn't always too hard. What I  mean is the game will go out of its way to put you at a ridiculous disadvantage, even if it means breaking it's own rules. Enemies will often have more health or armor than their level or stats should allow and will often get advantages such as extra AP and impossible ability cooldowns. this gets really annoying when you watch an enemy run at your mage from 30 feet away before attacking them three times (at 2 AP cost each). This scenario isn't even uncommon. What's worse is when the game spawns extra enemies in mid-battle. This wouldn't be a problem if there were any warning that this was going to happen but that's never the case because the game will often spawn in several enemies at a time and give them each a turn immediately. This can happen multiple times per battle meaning that, completely out of your control, a bunch of enemies spawned in and nuked you. This leads many fights to feel like the Braccus Rex fight from the first game, not hard but stupidly unfair for no good reason. I imagine this was the developers way to try and combat save scumming but what ends up happening is you need to save scum more simply because the game expects you to know in advance what its going to do. This gets so bad that I've seen entire fights go by without even moving: The enemy will get first turn, summon baddies and stun the entire party, making you helpless as the others pick you off one by one. This is bad fight design.  All in all, I like this game but am extremely disappointed in the way its encounters were designed. I don't want fights to be easy but I want to know that the enemies are playing by the same rules I'm confined to or at least similar ones."
95,DD,64,9,2,March 15,Not Recommended,426.7,"i played the former title, DOS EE for 570 hours in a row. That is the most enjoyable RPG i've ever played.  i started this DOS2 with very high expectation, but i'm dissapointed.  XP income is very restricted while you deaperately need appropriate level to win the battle. if you are underleveled, you can't kill just one enemy(not Boss) with your full four members in one round, while single enemy character(not Boss,again) easily kill your member in just one round. OK,OK, i know creative strategy and smart use of skills are needed to win the battle in this game. But it's almost impossible when you are underleveled in the first place.  My memorable first play stopped at the forced, scripted battle between 1st and 2nd chapter.i had to abandon the Save. In second play, i had to gather all the XPs available to win the coming forced battle.  i had to kill even the daramatically rescued NPCs after i get their thanks and quest XP rewards... when i left the first island, 80% of the population became corpse for my survival at the unavoidable battle. This is XP hunting slaughter, not role playing game...  Combat system is a total failure, i think. There're so many complicated debuff skills and terrain control skills, but NONE OF THEM WORKS AS LONG AS ENEMY HAS ARMOUR. And when you reduce their armour to zero, IT'S MUCH FASTER DIRECTLY ATTACK THEIR HP THAN WASTING YOUR ACTION FOR DEBUFFING.  There're so many skills and spells, but in combat all you have to do is same. Always attack with highest damage -expectable way.  In DOS EE, all combat are never the same depending on what tactics you selected. But in DOS2, all combat looks the same while selectable choices are too many. Far less enjoyable than the former title. For example, is there any meaning for two types of fire(normal and cursed) exists? While most enemy gets no damage with armour or elegantly teleport or fly to avoid them?  Many bugs still remain. You can recruit many NPCs to your mother ship for utility, but some of them never moves to your ship, just dissapear(fletcher and the salvaging boy ,for example)  Companion quest system is also annoying. When i talk to quest-related NPCs, companion A interrups to conversation and kill the NPC, so companion B's quest stops and can't be finished.(Sebile is the worst.she spoils the red lizard and Ifan's quests) Yes,it's avoidable through the dialogue IF YOU KNOW IT HAPPEN. Of course I didn't know it in my first play, so i had to abandone my play and load the data.What do you call it but annoying?  Crafting system is garbage. Don't bother to pick up and carry materials for crafting. You never use them. In DOS EE, crafted weapons are overpowered, i admit. But in DOS2, crafting has almost no purpose and meaning.Why goes extreme to extreme?  90% of the people in DOS2 prefer blunt weapons. You can get only hammer, mace, axes for your two-handed weapon expert. If you luckily find some, they are far too weaker than blunts. I WANT TO USE TWO-HANDED SWORD! WHY NOBODY SELLS THEM?  i hope DOS3 will be more evaluated and well-balanced one.  Oh, lastly to the players who has interest to this game via youtube or any oher movies.

The majority of what is there is top notch, but the double armor system drags the whole thing down. The way combat is designed forces you to abandon creative team builds in favor of either stacked melee or stacked caster teams.   I think the team imagined that allowing any character to learn any skill would encourage creative and interesting builds. Unfortunately it ends up doing the opposite. Nearly every enemy is designed to be able to defend against jack of all trades characters.   I understand that the enemies are weighted one side over the other either being more armored in physical than magical or vice versa, but It is very frustrating when its your turn and the character you are using is nearly useless because they are just going to end up chipping away at armor pool of the opposing armor type or simply being a buff bot for your other character. All you can think about is that you would have killed that character if you wouldnt have tried to have a diverse team build."
99,przemekk834a,101,32,11,July 30,Not Recommended,384.7,"Well, after playing this game a lot I decided to write a review (although I do not usually do it) and give it negative score, although I must admit that it's maybe a bit too harsh. This game has its qualities. Especially on the arts side (music, graphics, the world design, etc. ) it's simply marvelous. It also has deep, complex combat system, that in theory looks awesome. But not in practice -- more on this below.  Many criticisms of this game boil down to simple statement: Explorer mode is much too easy, but Classic mode is way too hard. There is a lack of ""sweet spot"" in difficulty between the two. But I do not think this is really the problem. I've beaten it at Classic and got as much fun as frustration and annoyance during that. So there isn't a problem with difficulty, but rather irritating game design mistakes the developers made. A few examples:  - The AI cheats and certain mechanics are unfair. For example, there is a Charm spell which makes enemies to fight on your side for short time - but enemies also can use it on you. When enemy charms you, AI takes away the control from you over your character but if you charm the enemy, the game will not give you the control over them. And the AI behavior differs. Charmed enemy characters frequently just skip turns or flee, while your characters will either attack your party, or senselessly waste your resources (potions, scrolls, SP). This is obvious cheating. Similar problem is with Taunt ability.  - The game tries extremely hard to be ""physical"" in restricting your casting and ranged abilities. The target must be in sight, the path must not be interrupted, etc. This looks cool on paper, but really leads only to some tedious gameplay. Isometric perspective is not convenient to judge spatial relations like this with required precision and you constantly are forced to adjust your position by trial and error - but every movement costs action points. So you must frequently save and reload if movement result is not right. Basically the only effect on gameplay of this ""cool mechanics"" is forcing save/reload scumming. ""The Pawn"" talent fixes it, but consumes one talent slot which are very few. This should be enabled by default. In addition to the above, terrain navmeshes are buggy and often the game thinks the path is blocked although visually it is not.   - This game loves to give unpleasant surprises to the player. A conversation with some innocently looking NPC often leads to a fight with half dozen guys who appear just out of nowhere. Solution - save, reload, cheese. Position your team away, send one to talk, during conversation teleport him back, finish conversation - now you have fight started on your terms. Definitely doable but extremely anticlimatic and immersion breaking.  - Teleportation is OP and too easily spammable. This leads to irritating situations when you waste time to position tactically your team, but enemy AI just decides to spam Nether Swap / Teleportation and shuffle you around so that you are in deep sh*t again.   - So called ""diablo loot system"" with gear leveling - everyone seems to hate it but game devs still push it into their games with no reason. Forces you to replace your gear every level or two. No way to upgrade.  - Not much sense of progress of your characters. You level up, but meet higher level enemies constantly and you are always a pushover, unless you find adequate gear for your level. Source magic is totally underwhelming - except ""Dome of protection"" and some high-tier spells that you can get only near the end. You never feel like a powerful Sourcerer you're supposed to be, but just some weakling trying to survive.  - Too hard, unbalanced fights are being offset by cheesy countermeasures like ""Dome of protection"" mentioned above or resurrection during battle. Resurrection scrolls are prohibitively expensive in the beginning and very cheap near the end. You can easily stock up on dozens of them and with help of ""Morning person"" talent make yourself almost immortal.   - Many UI problems and omissions. Movement of your team during map exploration is terribly slow - there is no ""fast mode"" like in PoE games. Chaining / unchaining by dragging portraits is awkward - having a ""chain/unchain all"" button would be nice, but there is no one. Inventory management sucks (as in all games in this genre), with so much gear management required it is a major hassle. Lack of ""sneak/unsneak all"" command. Edge panning is triggered even when you are using scrollbar in the inventory. No way to list inventory by name (how the hell that blackroot plant looked like?).   - In a game which forces you to save scum and reload all the time, you will often see the loading screen. In in this case it is absolutely terrible. Even longer than in PoE, and although does not appear during map exploration (full map is loaded), frequent reloading due to trial & error gameplay will make you hate the loading screen very quickly.  I could list a lot more issues, in fact there are tens of them and this review would be very long. Each of them separately is not that big, but as a whole they generate a lot of annoyance and you start to lose patience after a while. And this game is very long. Normally that would be a good thing. Content creators did a fantastic job, preparing so much amazing content. This game is worth its price just because of that. But what is the use of it all if playing the game gets frustrating and tiresome after some time spent with it?  So why am I NOT recommending this game? Because it stole away lots of hours of my time, but did not give me as much fun and satisfaction as I hoped for. I kept playing because I was hoping that the game would get better at later stage, or maybe after leveling up or respecing the team (I experimented a lot). But it never did really."

But however flawed it may be, the combat system is just as much fun as it was in the first game, with the interesting addition of physical and magical armor.   The first part of the game shows there's multiple diverse ways of completing objectives. However, there's little point to it because you're going to have to do every single one of them, or you'll be under-leveled going into the next section.   In all, it's a frustrating experience, even more so because the combat system at its core is very fun. Experimenting with skill combinations and builds is great. It just could've been so much more enjoyable if the pacing was a little better and the difficulty spread out a bit more."

106,MsSoda,30,1,0,May 21,Not Recommended,106.0,"This game is a RPG masterpiece. But several things hinder it to reach its full potential: Some combat skills take ages to be cast, which after the xth time gets really annoying. The charmed/taunted/maddened stats are horrific, because then the computer takes over your character and starts using random consumables like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In the combat there are often bugs, where it shows you that a spell is going to hit, but it just hits some random object or surface and gets blocked. The game takes ages to load. I know this is partly because of my system, but my main point here is, that in coop, the host needs to load the game and then invite other players, which in turn need to load again. A looby would have been nice here. There are often bugs when loading the game. There are often bugs while saving the game in coop, which kicks your fellow players (I suspect this only occurs on low end host systems).  This is a game, which makes me love and hate it at the same time. I'd really like to play through it a 2nd time, but because of all these above mentioned points I don't know.

107,Arsenal,102,4,0,"October 15, 2017",Not Recommended,7.0,"This game has a lot of promise but falls quite short of the mark. It lacks a lot of polish to be a great RPG.  I played with three others and one of my biggest complaints is with the combat crowd control. There was multiple time where we would engage in combat and I would get stunned (no big deal) then right before my turn I would get knocked down, then get petrified. I would be unable to actually take a turn sometimes throughout the entire encounter. Combat like that where the player has ZERO control throughout an encounter destroys the gameplay.   Other gripe is with the camera and theft functionality, you are in the town and want to talk to an NPC but as you go to click on the NPC they move and you end up stealing a stick. Now youre left to deal with the guards and possibly having to reload."

111,Gravy,64,10,1,"November 15, 2017",Not Recommended,146.2,"As someone else said - this is the best game I have ever given a negative review to. 146 hours on record as of this writing.  1. Some of the fights are virtually impossible on any difficulty except the easiest. The scarecrow fight is a great example of a fight I lost dozens of times on anything but the easiest difficulty.. I respecc'd every character several times and spent 20,000 gold on spellbooks and gear and still could not win this fight on any difficulty but the easiest (explorer). Some of the voidwoken fights you end up with two dead in your party by the end of the first round (usually the casters and bow users) because they get two-shotted. The enemy cooldown on spells is short - some can fear/curse/blind/terrify every other round....far more often than you can cure using peace of mind or other spells.  2. Crafting is nearly useless. 90% of what you craft is crap. the food benefit is minimal. The crafted weapons and armor are only good for the first hour of the game and then you will never need again. Potions are ok, but the action point cost to use them means you miss out on a round of damage for the small gain they bring. (breakeven at best).   3. No resurrection spell. <edit> I was informed this spell is available late in the game. Not helpful and this means I have to pickpocket every vendor with a ressurect scroll in their inventory to have neough to get through the fights.  4. Pickpocket is badly overpowered. Simply engage the target in conversation with one character and then switch to another character to do the pickpocketing. Once you have everything, move the person with the goods a screen away. Then change back and get out of the conversation and run away. By the time the npc goes their their ""I've been robbed"" drama all your characters are too far away for them to be searched.  5. Most non-human enemies can teleport/fly. This means they are all over the place and nearly impossible to kill using melee. Best party is 3 mages who all can summon multiple minions/totems and a ranger. (all must have restoration and teleport spells). The concept of a ""tank"" does not apply very much to this game since the enemies are all over the place and move around every round.  6. Wands and staffs are useless. They dont do enough damage to warrent using them when you can use another spell for those same two action points. Give your casters any two items that increase their spell damage (sheild, wand, sword, dagger, etc).  7. Highlighting - Why some things are highlighted and not others makes no sense. a flower across the map shows up but not the barrel/box/bones right next to you. The valuable painting on the wall does not highlight but the useless cooking pot does?   8. Stacking - I have 8 items in my inventory all called ""garlic"" and sometimes they stack and sometimes they dont. Same with pumpkins and other things.   In general, I find the game frustrating with moments of enjoyment."

113,Pelmaleon,38,49,1,"September 20, 2017",Not Recommended,64.8,"One thumb up, one thumb down (mixed review)  Pros: Really good atmosphere, art, voice acting, writing, music, and charm.  Cons: Terrible design choices in the new armor system (0% crowd control or status affliction chance while armor is up and 100% chance while armor is down) - makes encounter solutions incredibly repetitive and thus fairly boring, as they are too easy to ""solve"" via chained, 100% success rate crowd control. Also, on tactician there are not more enemies, but instead enemies just get huge boosts to their stats (armor included), making fun, hybrid parties bad, pushing you to use a more-repetitive either all physical or all magical party. The first Divinity Original Sin also had more chance involved (hit/miss chance for both attacks and crowd control), which this sequel pretty much eliminated, which makes fights very snowbally and predictable (and thus somewhat boring) towards the mid to end portions of the fight.  Poor, lazy loot design choice as every level up your lower level equipment becomes extremely outclassed by current level equipment found by tediously going to merchants and buying their newly updated wares. Also, loot attributes are randomized on most equipment so loot while adventuring feels way less special and lovable as you ditch them frequently for current-level loot with higher numbers (feels like Diablo 3 or Borderlands - games with the same lazy, constant slow-drip dopamine design choice).  Only 4 action points without a way to increase them (unless using OP lone wolf), makes fights much less tactical compared to the first Divinity: Original Sin 1 in which you slowly increased your action points as the game progressed, allowing fun combos. In this game you will use your most powerful skills/spells at the start of almost every single fight and then your second most powerful skills in the second round. Also, because action points are more sparse, scrolls and potions are used less frequently as they take precious action points away from using the aforementioned most powerful skills/spells. It makes the combat much more repetitive than the first Divinity: Original Sin.  Initiative system is botched. The turn order is now a round robin system as enemies always get a turn in between your characters, no matter how high your or their initiatives are. This makes fun multiple character combos less possible as enemies will often move or teleport before you have a chance to perform the full combo. Example: one character casts rain on the floor, enemy moves out of the water, and your second character can no longer electrocute the water with a lightning spell.  Stats are dumbed-down. Google Divinity:OS 1's stats and then Divinity:OS 2's stats and see the difference for yourself.  Small selection of damage-dealing magic spells (with many of them locked behind the anti-fun source system which forces you to spend a few and far between source points to use them).  Conclusion: If you liked the first Divinity Original Sin you will probably enjoy this one as well, even though most combat mechanics were changed for the worse. If you are looking for a superb, deep crpg experience similar to the past greats like Baldur's Gate, you may be disappointed."

115,Daemone Isos,181,39,33,September 6,Not Recommended,516.1,"I wanted to like this, but I did not.  I respect the enthusiasm of the people who enjoy it, but I have to admit that I was disappointed.  There were two related major design decisions that combined to take the fun out of the game for me.    The first was the general fussiness of many of the quests.  They were very particular in how they could be progressed, and that frequently led to either failure to continue, or a great deal of (unenjoyable) trial and error, or alt-tabbing to the wiki.  Each of these outcomes spoiled the immersion and momentum of the roleplaying.  The related design decision was the general absense of clear direction.  I truly respect this idea, but it poses high hurdles for implementation.  Combined with the general freedom to explore, it led me to random places on the map, with a nice open-world feel.  The problem was that I stumbled into heavily scripted quest areas which could not progress due to the first issue above.  For example, I fight a tough group of guardians, and suddenly nothing happens.  Apparently, those guardians are for some later part of the main quest, but the game gives me no clue or context about what is going on.  The quest logs sometimes make notes reminding me of people I have met and things I have seen, but no clues to follow.  So appearing to be dead-ended someplace interesting, I fall back on the wiki, to find out that this is the scene of a major scripted encounter that I have not yet triggered.  It feels deflating.  No, I don't want to use the wiki (aka spoiler bucket).  But arriving at a grand stage before the production starts is a drag.  It feels pointless.  And honestly, backtracking to some other (undefined) location to get back on the path that the quest doesn't point me to seems far too random.  To be explicit, wandering should yield encounters, not prevent them.  This process was confusing in Act I, frustrating in Act 2, and terminal in Act 3.  I wish the best to the development team, but I can't get excited to finish the game."

Once you leave Fort Joy, the games quality takes a sharp nosedive as it starts throwing encounters at you way out of your league without a warning unless you notice a single corpse laying on the ground and conjecture there might be enemies that will be spawned on you. Then there are so many glitches in the game it's extremely frustrating, such as the game straight up lying to you on who actually goes next in a turn based system. Such as MC, Party member #2, then #3, then #1, oh but wait, the boss gets a turn not shown on the UI and kills two of your party members because ""Didn't expect that did you?"". Then there's the extreme ramp in difficulty and scaling which puts MMO's to shame, from levels 1-10 you're increasing your damage by two or three points every level, but once enemies start hitting 11 and 12, their damage skyrockets by a hundred points.  The difficulty is all over the place as well. You can easily take on a 4v4 hidden hero encounter at level 9, while all the other enemies are level 12, and auto-revive into stronger versions with relative ease and tactics. But you talk to the wrong person, they forcefully initiate a fight 4v1, summon a monster in the middle of your entire team, and deals enough damage to OHKO your party members with a basic melee, and can opportunity attack. So you just fought a hidden boss encounter at level 9 and had a tough time but did eventually win it, and now you're getting OHKO'd by a simple minion a single character can summon multiple of?  It's fun, but manually save every three to four minutes, before you talk to anyone, before you walk into unknown territory, and after every single fight. The games autosave does a rather poor job of autosaving, and will make you lose hours of progress because ""Oh you talked to this person and didn't know it was going to be a fight."" There are a lot of forced encounters, save often, know what you're getting into before you get this game and learn it will throw artificial difficulty at you."

No clue.  5.Autosaves only happen once when you stumble onto an area where the game thinks you might die. But if you wander off and only run into the encounter later, you won't be covered. Or if you accidentally click on a 0 value spoon because the NPC you wanted to talk to moved and now everyone hates your dirty, thieveing guts and you thought ""damn, i should reload"" - well, your last save may be an hour ago. It should have autosaves on area changes and timed every 5-10 minutes in addition to the encounter specific ones.  6.Everything that can be used directly in some way gets tossed on your quickbar as soon as you pick it up, cluttering the ♥♥♥♥ out of your life.

There are arbitrary limitations on mission completion that will have you checking the wiki before you do anything, and have lots of save points to avoid ""accidentally"" preventing yourself from completiong a mission you've been working on.

122,Maud'Dib,15,3,0,May 8,Not Recommended,62.3,"I was really disappointed with this game. I really wanted to like it, but my frustration came down to 2 issues:  1) Randomness of elemental surfaces  This is supposed to be a strategic, tactical game, but the experience is completely marred by the randomness of the elemental surfaces. You can carefully position units and use spells to create surfaces only to have enemies randomly drop cursed surfaces that overwrite everything else are very difficult to remove.  Overall, it's difficult to prepare for a battle or try various tactics when the surfaces are so random and difficult to control. The game designers seem to love the surfaces mechanic to the extend that the entire battle system practically revolves around it, and I found it kind of boring and frustratingly unpredictable.  2) Strange difficulty settings  The game is either way too easy or way too hard. I've read interviews with the devs saying they want the game to be hard—ok, then why did you provide difficulty settings at all? It seems like hedging on their design. if they want this to be a difficult game, that would be fine and I'd know it's probably not for me. Difficulty settings imply I should be able to tailor the experience, and that option really isn't there. It's either brutally difficult or so easy that every enemy dies in a single hit.  I want some challenge, but I have a limited amount of time to play games and I don't want to spend 2 hours reattempting the same battle. On the other hand, the easiest difficulty setting makes the game so easy it's not really even enjoyable (it's so easy I'd rather just read a book).  Overall, I was either frustrated or bored. The battles were never satisfying—only too frutsrating or so easy they were boring."
123,The 4th Survivor,107,91,7,August 7,Not Recommended,70.4,"I really wanted to like DOS2 considering it boasts a DM mode, custom community content, nice graphics, interesting plot, and DnD-like gameplay, however one thing completely ruined it for me after having already played DOS1EE, that one thing is the way combat is handled with the ""armor"" system.  Everything was shaping up to be objectively better compared to the experience I had with Divinity: Original Sin 1 Enhanced Edition before I even played Divinity: Original Sin 2. After playing it though the ""Armor"" system quickly ruined the gameplay and pigeon-holed me(and my buddy) into only a few styles of play. The  ""Armor"" system is basically a health bar for your physical and magical armor that prevents Crowd Control effects till its broken and has to be replenished the same way health is, sounds pretty interesting and good on paper right?? However, in practice this means that crowd control is impossible to use until enough physical or magical damage is given to the enemy you want to use an ability on in question which becomes a problem for people who wanted to build a tanky character or multiclassed character who will be unable to do enough damage to ever be useful when compared to DOS1EE.  The best example I can give to compare the versatility of building a character in the first game is when I played with my friend he went full on support(basically reverse engineered a bard class) mixing a bunch of different magical schools and he was always able to contribute to our mutual success even without using damaging spells(which he could still use but he decided to specialize more in healing/haste/dmg buffs&accuracy buffs etc) contrast that with my character who was built towards maximizing health and resistances whilst also using 2 handers, basically a tank who didn't use shields. We were both successful and had a lot of fun with it even though neither of us were focusing on damage. When we played DOS2 we very quickly realized that mixing and matching even 2 different focuses was hampering our ability to deal with any given situation as we couldn't do enough damage to use 90% of our abilities effectively thanks to the armor system.  My final gripe is that lone wolf was broken compared to DOS1EE. In DOS1EE if your friend decided to choose lone wolf, they could still have a single companion with then, and you were the one who couldn't use a companion. Makes sense and doesn't ♥♥♥♥ over your buddy because of your decisions right? Well in DOS2 if one of you takes it then you both might as well because if even one extra companion is in your party you lose the effects of lone wolf for whatever reason. Additionally just because you picked up lone wolf in DOS1EE didn't mean you were stronger than a party of 4, it was more an option for people that didn't want to manage more characters and preferred a different style of play. Not the case in DOS2 as we quickly found out that the most viable option in the entire game is 2 lone wolves going for a pure damage build, every other option is so much worse that you cannot really expect to have fun trying out anything that isn't pure damage and it is all thanks to how the ""Armor"" system was implemented combined with the changes to lone wolf making it overpowered instead of just different.  I never really expected to be so put off by the sequel when I had so much fun with the first game. In DOS1EE both of our characters were unique and well thought out and in the DOS2 our characters became thinly armored artillery cannons and battering rams out of necessity rather than ingenuity and that is why I am disappointed in DOS2. I really wanted to not only like it but love it but me and my buddy got bored and couldn't even finish our campaign compared to when we played DOS1EE we couldn't put the game down day after day until it was over.  Maybe Definitive Edition will solve these issues but I remain doubtful based on how the armor system was implemented, it's very existence will be practically sewn into the game at this point and even a second comb over from the devs will likely keep it very much the same."

129,Dobermann,595,No,0,April 28,Not Recommended,126.4,"Big fan of the first Original Sin. Had a lot of fun playing it through with two pads and split screen with a friend. This review is meant for fans of the first one and are looking more of the same. For those without Original Sin experience I can say I wouldn't recommend this game as a first Original Sin game.  So what has changed? Archery has been improved and is usefull in the beginning already. You have access to many skills that allow you to move full spell range from your enemies without any opportunity attacks to block you. Saddly, so has most of the enemy also. So you and your advesaries jump around a lot more than in the first one.  You have two different types of armor, physical and magical. Physical armor is meant to be removed before you are able to get health damage and extra effects like knockdown throuh. Same with magical armor and spell effects, just using different bar. This means you should use different damage on different enemies. It isn't challenging as much it is limiting.  A lot more different skills. Most of you won't be using at all. Not because they have far more useful counterparts, but also because you are introduced a memory slot system that only lets you learn a limited number of skills/spells. These can be changed out of battle, so with save/load scoutiing you can set them optimal before fight. So, not challenging, just limiting.  With creative usage of foliage and height differences your surroundings are much more lively than in the first one. Sadly I also found them more difficult to understand. Height differences should create tactical opportunities but they are lost because everyone jump around. Don't worry, the indicator is still the same white spot that you can't find in fiery surroundings.  You can't choose your fights as ambushes are used a lot. With save/load scouting and using indestructible foot high carpet rolls as barricades you might be able to capture a hint of the first ones strategical dimensions, but do note that enemy will jump around. Cities are not a safe zone. Game tries to irritate you into fight there propably even more than in the nature. Load will be used often. After you leave from first island, game will penalize you about loading with long load times. Don't dare to think what they would be without SSD.  You won't be using crafting much at anything. It has been downgraded close to zero from the first one forcing you to rely on drops and vendors with your gear.  Clear bugs that should not be in a finished product. ""Press B to end your turn"" indication is left to other players screen after battle. Game stops registering xbox controller that has been left unattended for a while. The quests also have a lot more unrefined feel to them compared to the first game.  The first Original Sin was difficult for us from time to time, but all in all it was rewarding. Can't say the same at all about the second one. A lot of clocked game time has been used looking at the same loading screen. Not just because of some difficult fights, but trying to realize if you were meant to fight with them at that point or at all as even your potential companions try pick a fight with you.  So, like I said earlier, I can't recommend this game to be the first Original Sin game. But I can't recommend it to be the second one either."

Custom characters are deprived of important story chunks and in game decisions in favor of the premade ones and party interaction is gone (it's basically tacked on multiplayer now, the game doesn't even acknowledge more than 1 player).  Might be a good single player game, but I was hoping for more of the same, which was disappointing.  Update after spending 70 hours in single player:  At some point around the 50 hour mark, the game started to give me errors while saving, though it would still save the game anyway. After that, my profile bugged out. Every time I booted the game, my profile name changed to Debug_Player_Profile_1 and the original profile was gone. The folder was still there, though. Copying saves to a new profile didn't work, and neither did the other solutions suggested in the Larian forums and Steam forums. The only solution I found was to back up my saves, wipe out the profile folder and make a new profile with the same name as the original, which the game suddenly recognized in the cloud and gave me my saves back. I managed to play for a few hours after that, but this morning there were no saves in the cloud anymore and the debug profile was back.   TLDR Broken game, stay away"

136,JayRob,503,20,1,"September 22, 2017",Not Recommended,41.2,"Beware hyperbole.  ""Best game ever"" this is not.   Story is pretty interesting, and the first act of the game is fun.    The combat overall is pretty poorly balanced.  The armor mechanic, while seeming interesting at first, really hurts the balance later in the game.  Crowd control is basically neutralized, as you can't apply any status effect while a character's armor is still up.  There are certain battles which require you to protect certain NPCs under a time limit.  The enemy will all tunnel vision on the one NPC you're supposed to protect, in some cases this is 6+ enemy combatants.  You can't possibly outdamage that many enemies so normally your strategy would be to use crowd control to delay them until the time limit is up.  However, due to the armor system, this requires you to essentially outdamage 6+ enemies AND apply crowd control to them BEFORE they can kill your VIP.  This is simply impossible, especially with a 2-man Lone Wolf group.  The issue here seems to be a lack of playtesting all the various options that are available to the player.  Many power combinations are too powerful and others are not competitive.  Look no further than the infinite damage loop bug that the developers almost kept in the game because it was ""creative"".  The higher difficulties just exacerbate these issues even more.  The combat overall just lacks nuance, it doesn't feel tactical, mainly due to a lack of defensive options i.e. ways to negate or deter enemy actions.  This is putting aside all the combat bugs which are incredibly frustrating, such as Attacks of Opportunity not triggering and your character's turn being skipped for no reason.  This is all very sad after hearing laughable claims like ""More strategic than XCOM.""  I've put about 40 hours (half of that being pre-release) in the game on the higher difficulties before I couldn't stand the poor combat any longer.  I may start over on explorer simply to experience the story, which was quite good in my playtime.  I will give big kudos to the developer for adding full voice-overs, as it enhances the immersion and engagement of the story ten-fold.  Maybe I've gotten my money's worth already, but I am overall feeling disappointed, and I expected a lot more.  Wait for the inevitable Enhanced Edition I guess?  P.S.

Act 2 specifically has some of the best side quests, world building, and characters of any game I have ever played. However the last act craps all over that. It switches from turn based rpg to more of a full on puzzle game, it is absolutely littered with generic npcs unlike the other areas, and all the fights go from tactical well thought out battles to games of ""find the gimmick that will help you cheese this fight""  On top of that they built up a phenomenal story with fantastic characters only for the ending to be incredibly bland and generic.

143,Pool,205,16,1,"December 27, 2017",Not Recommended,22.8,"Divinity Original Sin 2.  TL;DR: 6/10. Get it on sale.  The bad:  Writing: The writing for this game is muteable at best. It and NWN 1 share the 'main campaign is♥♥♥♥♥ syndrome. I do not like any of the NPCs, any of the quests or any of the plots. It lacks feeling, everything is so gray and cliche.  Barrel mechanics: The game is oversaturated in environmental hazards, most notably barrels. I feel these are to the game's detriment and I am loathed to see them no matter where they are.  Game mechanics: They're not very satisfying. It's over-saturated in magic, conditions and punishes you for being tried-and-true melee as opposed to being any sort of spellcaster or ranged combatant. Even the monsters are throwing magic. Quit that. There's also physical and magical armor, that halves damage and... huh? It's more convoluted than any of the DND rulesets prior to 5E, as someone who's played them religiously for a decade.  Lack of direction: The game sort of just... plops you in and expects you to find your way. The NPCs you do talk to basically mumble about nothing worthwhile before dropping bread crumbs of a quest in their mumble and expecting you to unravel it. Your friend? Where? Who? What? Where do I find them? Who are they? What were they doing that got them captured? Elaborate. Give me something to go on. But lets say for the sake of it that you decide to play along and actually adventure around trying to find what they're talking about. I personally could not care any less about the actual adventuring aspect, because the terrain is the same old ugly terrain that puts me to sleep to just look at it. It suffers from 'everything is samey and bland' syndrome, like Path of Exile.  Camera angles: Ungodly awful. To swivel and look around with it is a headache. Two different buttons just to pan your camera? Neverwinter Nights one called, they said they want to loan you the driving camera.  Bugs: There's so many bugs. NPCs will randomly turn hostile (even if you did nothing to upset them, no thievery, no nothing). Sometimes in the arena beneath Fort Joy, you'll beat all of the combatants. If you're playing with friends, you'll have to fight each other for dominance. Even if you win (or lose), sometimes you'll just be stuck roaming around the map because it won't pull you out, and you'll have to reload. The bugs steadily become worse and worse by act 4.  Poorly planned Multiplayer: The ability to play with three other people is a nice gesture, BUT, to play with them, you'll have to start with them at the very beginning. You can't introduce a character mid-game and have them scale up or down to the main character's level. Otherwise, you'll have to play some limp gimp premade NPC who the main player probably uses as nothing more than a loot mule and a bullet sponge.  ---- The 'meh'  UI: It's serviceable. It's not great, often times the chat box will get stuck where you're trying to click. Sometimes, when you're trying to control an NPC, it won't completely register what you wanted to do, and instead your character who's at the top of this post will instead abandon his post to chase a barrel.  The soundtrack: Generic Latin-lite choirs. It is so bland it is incapable of being offensive to the ear. It is unspired and to be truthful, I did not care for it.  Art Design: The game is bland and grey on the art design as well. Nothing jumps out and impresses. The cutscenes in which drawn characters do battle or things of that sort look far better, but the game itself is just... meh. It's clear that the armor was intended to be little more than just shapes to tell who was who when zoomed out at full capacity. ---- The good:   Initiative track: The game has a functioning initiative list, where you can join battles mid engagement, as well as ensure everyone has a fair turn. NWN had one of these but didn't truly work.  Moddable: Like Neverwinter Nights, you can mod the game to high hell and back, changing a lot of the problem I had with the game.  Custom modules: You can completely ignore the primary campaign and play different modules. There is also a DM feature, in which the DM can control NPCs, create pieces on the dot, make them talk and onwards. Much, again (if you haven't seen a running theme in comparison) like Neverwinter Nights and to the game's favor.  -----  Final verdict: The game is serviceable as an RPG, but not very fun to play. I believe the future of this game does not rest in the production of the company, but rather in the hands of the community."

Tactical combat full of choices and decisions, with a boatload of skills to combine with each other to get you through. However - battles sometimes start completely without warning, some of them are just unwinnable by design, others seem to expect you to save-scum to get your people into a winnable starting position.  Excellent story full of twists and turns, with excellent character design and writing. However - quests are poorly defined, goals and conditions to complete them sometimes comparable to the worst among point-and-click adventures. Remember the times when you had to scan the screen, clicking each pixel to find the one that's interactable? Now imagine having a huge, open map where you need to find the specific doodad that advances the quest - except you have no idea where it's supposed to be or what it even looks like.  Puzzles - some of them make sense, others are of the 'you got to be kidding me' variant. I stumbled over some solutions just by accident, others i finally caved and checked a wiki for.  I guess that's my main problem - the longer the game goes on, the more i feel myself drawn to consult a wiki to deal with frustration.  Having to consult an external source to enjoy a game is something i see as a failure on the design side - solutions to your game should be findable inside the game, not by consulting a third-party resource.  The game is full of awesome moments and great stories, and it genuinely entices me to explore it more. At the same time it frustrates me to no end with its design choices. It feels like one of the games I loved as a kid - full of character, deeply immersive, but also deeply flawed in a way sure to frustrate.

149,maats,113,6,2,"October 3, 2017",Not Recommended,181.4,"First let me say I played Divinity Original Sin through twice. I loved that game. So naturally I was looking forward to DOS2. Admittedly both games have alot in common but not everything. The big exception seems to be play balance. The play balance in the classic mode of DOS was nearly perfect and I played the entire gamne through in that mode. Classic mode wasn't so easy it would be boring and just difficult enough so you had to be careful about your strategy or suffer death. Not so with DOS2.   I started playing in classic mode at Fort Joy and found it challanging but not impossible. However after heading to Reapers Cove it became impossible to beat any mob unless there was some trick to it that permitted me to beat them without fighting. Each mob was at least two levels above me and they always got to attack first. Worse each member of the mob would have three or four moves even before I was able to attack. So with an mob of 4 guys they would make up to 12- 16 moves BEFORE I could even attack. Bythat time each of my guys would be low on armor, frozen, diseased, poisoned outflanked etc. That automatically put me in a defensive mode to heal armor and/or health points which meant I wasn't hitting back. When I was able to hit back my attacks did far less damage to them than they did to me. This doesn't include them using spells on me that weren't available for purchase or too expensive to buy.  So I figured I try playing in story mode which is so easy I could probably take on a voidwoken with a toothbrush and win.   I don't know what the developers did to screw up the game balance but it's not longer fun to play in either story or classic mode. I don't want to give it a thumbs down becasue I'm  going to play in story mode to gain a few levels to even things out and then go back to classic mode to see if there's a difference. But I can't give it a thumbs up either because things might end up just as unbalanced when I switch back to classic mode. Since I have to choose one or the other I have to give it a thumbs down based on my experience so far. Hopefully all will be well if I level a couple of times but I'm not keeping my fingers crossed.  Ok, heres a second take on DOS II. The game is buggy, and not in a minor way. For example the pipe puzzle quest doesn't work. Nothing flows into the pipe channels when I press the control tiles. I was able to get around it somewhat by standing at the right or left corner of the control panel and placing a transport pyramid on the other side of the barrier (I'm sure that's a bug too). Then I transported down to where the three valves are and manually turned them. That got the holy elements flowing into the channels.  Unfortunately they don't flow in the correct direction when I move the control tiles. I hate this. This is a game stopper inasmuch to the best of my knowledge I need to finish this in order to continue the main quest.  IMO there's no excuse for this. When the smaller quests are bugged it's irritating but I can get around them. But now I can't advance in a game I shelled out $40 for.  What a joke."
150,Phantus,289,27,12,September 3,Not Recommended,265.1,"This game's a bit of a mess.  The armour system is poorly thought out as is the leveling and scaling system.  The environmental hazard is out of control and Act 4 seemed like it was done by Larians B team.  Everything is on fire.  Everything is poisoned.  Everything is frozen.  Everything is steamy.  Having the environment react to elemental spells and abilities is a cool idea but if they cut the sheer amount of this by half it would still be too much.  Battlefields ultimately become a ridiculous game of elemental hopscotch.  It's hard to tell what's going on half the time through the smoke and steam.  It's comical after awhile.  The armour, weapons and level scaling is a self-inflicted wound for Larian.  The hours I spent going over merchant wares to find better weapons because mine had become obsolete after a few levels must have accounted for a quarter of my play time.  These topics have been done to death so I'll leave them alone suffice to say you don't have to reinvent every wheel you come across.  It doesn't make sense, it didn't work and sadly bogs down a good story, interesting characters and nice graphics.  It's a popular game and many happily overlook its faults so I'm happy for them.  I simply prefer effort being put into reasonable mechanics over trying to be unique at any cost."

Perma status have plagued this game to the point where it is happening so frequently it's becoming cumbersome to fix the game saves everytime. I have had trouble with: perma burning from cursed unique/legendary already removed, perma decay, perma wet and having characters be able to keep fighting when their hp is below 0.   It's a simple fix: extracting the save, converting a LSX<->LSF file and editng a rather large XML file to set status to temporarily if you have any programming experience. To the less tech savy I can see this being an issue, as I have had to do it quite a few times now. Would not recommend this game as great as it is till these issues are fixed completely.

152,Rear Fanged Venomous,29,20,2,January 13,Not Recommended,81.8,"While the game is very entertaining for some time, parts of the integral mechanics become unbearable over time. The AI of the enemy is insufferable, as they will merely walk around and drag fights out for seemingly no reason. While on this topic, the fights, while extremely interactive and unique, granted, take a very long time to complete. The ability to skip or speed up turns would go a long way to making the gameplay flow better. When completing questions, waypoints will appear and never leave; even when you beat the quest they will remain.  On the story side, I am torn. The lore in the game is incredibly in-depth with a plethora of supernatural powerhouses and somewhat unique powers, but the story itself is brutally bad. Do NOT read further unless you are OK with spoilers. While the first half of the story is very engaging and interesting, it completely falls apart half way through. Everyone who was bad turns good (except one), everyone who is good turns bad, the decisions you make don't matter. Anyone who you choose to kill will come back (if only to die again literally two minutes later) and there is nothing you can do to prevent this, despite the game tricking you into thinking your choices matter. The primary antagonist uses a weapon that is never mentioned once to beat you in one of the hardest ""this only happened because plot"" moments I have seen in fiction. For the final decision, the choice does impact the world, but at that point you don't get to see the effects outside of a minute long epilogue.   On the whole, the gameplay is generally good but has very irritating issues, such as bad NPC AI and permanent waypoints. The story, despite having an incredible potential and great worldbuilding, falls flat on its face harder than I have ever seen a story do.  TLDR: If you are in exclusively for the gameplay and are OK with long fights, questionable AI, and permenant waypoints, you will love it. If you are in it for the story or any of the aforementioned problems seem unbearable, skip this game."
153,Eyndra,70,24,2,February 5,Not Recommended,88.9,"I have some really mixed emotions about this game.   I'll start with the good.   This game's platform is very good. In a party oriented strategic RPG I have never played a game with better mechanics.   This game's platform for modding is left very open ended and mod-friendly, and user created content can really enrich the experience.   There is a lot of nuance in character builds, and you can make your character a useful addition to a team, or play solo in many fulfilling ways.  The bad?   Unless you're playing with the max of 4 people in co-op, this game will keep you busy for no more than 40 hours.   The story isn't open-ended, there is no new game+, and you can't revisit the world after the game is over.   The story is hilariously convoluted and you'd have to have a flair for tin-foil-hat levels of curiosity and tedium to be able to enjoy that aspect.   There is no gratifying ending available to you in this game.   Most interesting character development is walled behind ""speech checks,"" where you're given the option to choose several dialogue options that will impact the character's development; which isn't a problem in particular, but the developers were a little overzealous, with some character arcs requiring the correct permutation of up to 40 of these ""multiple choice"" options, with some details being so minute no blame could be assigned for failing them.   The developers added a ridiculous amount of detail to this game without actually adding any ""meat and potatoes"" content that is rewarding for the player.   You are expected to explore every nook and cranny on every map to be able to appreciate the story, with the continuation of some story arcs locked behind some buried pouch in some obscure and completely insignificant location.   Without the aid of mods, the game is seriously absent of balance; mods are the lifeblood of this game's accessibility.  In summary, as a single person looking to buy this game to without the intention of co-op, it is seriously not worth full price. There are more options to explore in the multiplayer arena that may make the game more fun for small groups, but regarding what the developers have provided us with, the game is sorely lacking and you'll end up paying for more than you get."

A few improvements to the original, but still makes all the same mistakes as the original did. If you liked the original, by all means, take the dive. But if you found the original frustrating, boring or hated the scavenger-hunt style of quest design, you will find nothing has changed. Expect lots of vague objectives and wandering around aimlessly for hours at a time whilst waiting to stumble on the solution to quests. Saving and reloading the game is the primary progression mechanic and the enemies in this game will routinely wipe you out instantly on anything but the easiest difficulty setting.   I recommend you avoid this game unless you're personally pretty sure you'll like it. It is meant for a certain type of gamer (ones pejoratively dubbed 'The Commentocracy' by game critic Jim Sterling) and I am not one of them. That said, it's likely everyday folks might eke out some extra enjoyment from the excellent co-op mode, which is the only feature that makes these games worth buying imho -- having a friend along dulls the impact of the terrible design issues the rest of the game has. Or maybe misery loves company.

164,Olnia,129,7,3,March 13,Not Recommended,71.5,"An honest review about Divinity: Original Sin 2.  Divinity 2 leaves me with bittersweet feelings about the future of storytelling in general for video games.   This game started off so amazingly well; the plot, gameplay and character detail in everything you did was what drew me into playing a top-down adventure RPG for hours a day.   In a time of completely over-the-top FPS games and reckless abandon-style ""story-driven"" RPGs about covert operation soldiers, as concieved by one completely insane Japanese man (ala Metal Gear Solid: 1-anything), this game is a breath of fresh air and the reason why I felt compelled to write a formal review for the first time ever.  The gameplay is top notch for a turn-based RPG; with tactics and interuption strategies taking precedent over gear investment and level-grinding.   This is truly the ""thinking man's RPG"", forcing players on higher difficulties to make careful decisions in almost every scenario.   Formulating balanced parties and covering individual weaknesses is key to success, as the game will take every chance to test your combat readiness.     The customization is very good; only lacking in some of the most abstract and long-term of considerations.   One such example is: min-maxing characters into specific roles essentially becomes non-existant after the second act of the game, as you find a way to alter and re-distribute character skill points into anything you like, at any time.   This really detracts from the overall committment I thought I was forced into making, as early on in the game I was carefully analyzing every level-up I recieved, so as to maximize my party's adaptability.     (SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARD)    That however, is only a formality when compared to the story and its ending: wow, I don't think I have ever seen such a great story completely destroyed by it's ending since the iconic Ultima series (ironic as I have compared this game series to our generation's Ultima).     The Plot starts off amazing; a quest to ascend and become gods, retaking a long-vacant, world-ruler throne as the new ascended Divine.    The notes of long-term D&D campaings called me into playing this game, as one of the atractions of playing D&D long-term is to eventually become a god of a particular focus and take up the responcibilities of said god.     This game has no intention of letting you rule anything.      I know I'm basically spoiling the ending for you, but this game was clearly rushed due to monetary restrictions.   The final act of the game, which should be the most diverse and spraling location of the entire world of Rivelon, is oddly boring and lacks any focused polish.   The endings of tag-line quests are scatter-shot in terms of satisfaction; some (mainly Lohse's quest) leave you feeling like something meaningful was acomplished and are now closer to your companion as a result, while others feel dull and rushed, making the entire story of traveling with this companion feel worthless.     The final ending: sucks.    It really sucks; leaving the players feel like they are in a rejected Highlander-style fan fiction, the ending boils down to convincing your companions to accept your divinity over theirs, overwise taking their heads in confrontation to prove that there can only be one.   While the final boss battle is epic and challenging, ultimately the choice boils down to several options that you don't care about and, quite frankly, do not represent the intentions of the players who invested almost a hundred hours into playing this game.   After everything I had learned from playing this game in its entirety; my ultimate decision to rule Rivelon was subverted by a speech desicion I had made two hours before the ending when I lied to someone to gain their favor, a decision which was made practically applicable over the course of the entire game and never punished me for making such a desicion.     While the game has its flaws (It has major flaws!!!) it is highly enjoyable to play alone or with friends in Multiplayer.   While I hate the ending that basically aborts all your work throughout the story, the game provides a combat/D&D replication system so addictive, that this is the first top-down RPG I have played in over a decade.   Ignoring the crappy ending to the story, this game is a great way to waste an entire week on the computer if you choose to get invested in its gameplay.  Thanks for reading"

Except, the devs still haven't learned some basic 'niceties' of gameplay.  Take a look at...any other game of this turn-based AP genre, and you won't find a single one of these problems.  Graphics 9/10 Story and Lore 10/10 Character Complexity 9/10 Gameplay 1/10 Combat Rules 1/10  1. Don't let me shoot into the floor.  Stop me.  Don't make me waste the AP.  This is simple stuff guys.  Yes, I can see that it says my LOS is blocked, but then why allow me to click?  You've trapped the error, now do something with it for darn sake. 2. Why does line of sight NOT work for bad guys?  They have no line of sight rules at all.  Shoot through a floor, a rock, a ceiling, a wall, no problems.  Reciprocal line of sight is ignored, and enemies have no penalty for low height apparently.  The algorithm clearly has a trap in it that says ""ignore the LOS step if it is AI targetting player'.  This is a design choice you have consciously made.  This is an admission of guilt by the devs that they couldnt get it right in gameplay instead. 3. Don't make my toons walk through stuff on the floor if they can get around it easily.  Make it easy for me to avoid.  The most common path in this game appears to start with ""Make a u-turn at Alberquerque and folloow the Basingstoke Roundabout"". This, too, is simple stuff guys.  Oh, but the enemies avoid it, so there is sensible pathing programmed into the game.  So why the hell can't I use the same pathfinding algorithm?  Oh yeah, reasons. 4. In trade, let me sell stuff off differnt guys.  Don't make me move it all into one inventory first.  Simple improvement in quality of life for me.  You will spend an extraordinary quantity of time just screwing around with bags in this game for ... reasons. 5. Yes, I am covered in oil and slowed.  No, it is totally unecessary to make my toon walk like a cripple.  I get it.  He's slow.  Now hurry the hell up and let me play.  Sigh... 6. I hide my Rogue.  The combat starts.  My rogue goes last.  So much for 'sneak' attack.  Its alsmost like smart tactics lead to dumb results according to the rules they apply.  If you are keen to have innovative tactics, maybe make them rewarding. 7. Height line of sight is totally nuts.  There are places that can see everything, and be attacked from nowhere, but only if you are an AI.  For no reason at all.  In the Fort Joy arena, yes, the enemy platform is totally invulnerable, since I cannot see the floor even if it were in range.  That's just garbage.  Oh, and when I am there, I can see...well...pretty much nowhere. 8. Hiding behind a wall, on the other side of the battlefield - no problems!  Enemy will suddenly have one hundred AP to walk on over and kill you.  Don't worry, not a bug at all.  Nice, fair, even combat, with sensible rules.  I've seen toons walk thirty metres and then use two abilities, even though they used all their AP the turn before. 8. Basic bugs - ""Blinded was removed by Clear Minded"" followed immediately by being unable to shoot because I am Blinded.  Hahahahahahahahahaha. Ox dung. 9. Enemy uses four two-AP abilities in a turn, and moves as well.  Yeah...umm...say what?  There are simply so many things in the turn-based part of this game which are pointlessly tedious, and so many things that should have been found in playtest, that I wonder if about half of the gameplay is you fighting the interface and stupidity of the toons, or the devs themselves.  Yes, this is a game where you fight everyone but the enemy at times.  The rest of the game, still absolutely awesome.  The lore and concepts are great, the maps are fantastic, the humour even has some bite.  But the gameplay niceties are totally missing.  Just like last time around.  This is the same kludge of rubbish, clothed in a pretty suit."
170,Herakilla,460,13,8,March 30,Not Recommended,61.1,"I loved the first game and played that multiple times as well as the enhanced edition.  This game starts out great.  The changes they made to almost all of the core mechanics are awesome.  But these changes have some serious side effects.  The AI is essentially too smart is what it all boils down to.  For example. there is no point in having a tank in your party because every class has multiple teleports available to it so your tank just gets ignored.  They have a lot of armor and health but what good is that if the AI just completely ignores them and uses teleports to go after your healer and damage dealers. You might think you can defeat this with superior tactics but there are just so many teleports you really can't put the AI in a position where it is forced to attack your tank.  On top of that the AI gets much faster cooldowns on the same spells that you have.  Your ability to knock down a target will have a 3-4 turn cooldown.  That exact same ability in the hands of the AI has a 1 turn cooldown so it can be used every single turn allowing the AI to put your party members in stun locks very often.  Good luck if you run out of either physical or magical armor.  And to make matters even worse the game has horrific loading times and still suffers multiplayer connection issues.  Expect to spend at least 5 minutes just loading your save.  Then your friends have to spend at least the same amount of time loading when they connect to you.  Saving takes at least half a minute most of the time even on a good machine.  And party members get timed out very often which requires them to once again go through the long loading process when they reconnect.  Very frustrating to deal with.  Putting the game on an SSD doesn't seem to help very much which is embarassing.  There are a lot of small issues that add up to a tedious experience as well.  Persuasion system is a step back from the first game (and I wasn't the biggest fan of that either) due to cost of the stat.  There are many times when a quest or objective is completed but only one member in the party has knowledge of that fact even though all of the characters were present and involved every step of the way, rather immersion breaking.  The magic pockets feature is extremely picky and doesn't seem to work with quest items and even some keys.  The AI always has an abundance of action points enabling them to take 3+ attacks during their turns even after moving.  The world itself isn't designed well enough to guide the players on a linear path even though if you try to go outside the path you should be following you will get murdered."

Apparently all of the rules are suspended for the adversary in the last game. Characters with NO status effects that would skip a turn get skipped over and over. Everything you learn is useless.

But something about it just grates with me. I find it frustrating as much as anything else. I’m not saying I don’t enjoy it, but the moments of frustration come too frequently to make it likely I’ll replay it. The lack of direction is fine, I don’t mind random exploring, except – the complete lack of logic to solve some of the puzzles unless you have stumbled on some clues is infuriating.  Like, you get into a tomb but can’t open the sarcophagus. There’s a pressure plate and 3 levers on the wall. If you happen to have gone first into the tomb with the clues, you’re good. If not, Save Trial and Error Reload - for a very long time, because there is no logic to the solution. And even if you had come across the clues, chances are you’d not have taken them in. There are far too many books to read, which makes us skim through some of them, which is a mistake, because 3 hours down the line you may just need the clues in one of a hundred books you didn’t carefully read. Some of the battles are unnecessarily long and tedious – a good example is the one in the Blackpits where you have what feels like a thousand bug things to take out. One after a-boring-nother. There are too many skills – it feels padded out – just how many poison skills does one Geomancer need? Maybe Larian should have considered skill upgrades? When you have a character with Geo/Pyro/Summon who has like 60 skills, often you need to get half way through a long battle to know you have the wrong ones equipped for that particular scenario. Unneccessarily complex imho. Bugs: okay, a few minor bugs are inevitable with a game like this – you know that when you buy it. But some are just too big to overlook. Tarquin – there’s a lot of Tarquin bug posts.   In my case he won’t leave the darned boat and go to the Graveyard and trigger his quest. I’ve gone to that graveyard so many times, but nope, he’s still hanging on the boat. I’ve already stumbled across the artifacts, lord only knows if I’ll ever get the chance to give them to him. And I read a lot where players say he won’t return to the boat – don’t know who’s better off lol.  I totally want to love this game, but am struggling to do so. I expect I’ll play it through to the bitter end, there’s enough to enjoy to keep me at it. But I will have sworn a lot, a very very lot, before I get there.  I'm not saying don't buy it - it's a lot of hours of fun as well as mind numbing vexation; I just feel I can't actually recommend it."

176,Rigel,170,14,0,April 29,Not Recommended,22.1,"I'll be honest: For the life of me, I don't get why people love this game so much. Clearly they do.... I am very, very obviously in the minority so far as opinions go here. But I played the first few hours of the first game and despised it, and decided to try this one out because a bunch of friends wanted in on it and I heard they fixed a lot of the pacing issues from the first game.  It's a carbon copy of the first game, near as I can tell. Mistakes included. The game world is INCREDIBLY cluttered, full of items and backstories and details that are not and never will be important. It has a ton of mechanics, only a fracton of which ever seem even slightly important. It has a bunch of characters with complex backstories.... most of which don't matter in the slightest. Every fight is either way too easy or way too difficult with no middle ground.   A ton of backstory is thrown at you almost immediately, more than you can possibly take in quickly and requires you to either slow your pace to a crawl - which is DEATH in a multi-player RPG like this where everybody needs to be paying attention and equally invested in the story, lest someone get bored - OR, for you to just skim through it as quickly as possible and have no earthly idea what's going on. A character early on got killed in cold blood by another character; I had no idea who either one was, or why I was supposed to care, though I obviously was meant to.   The mechanics, as I mentioned, are often over-complicated and irrelevant. There are food items everywhere, and crafting components, but they hardly seem worth the effort, so why bother having them at all? They're just more noise. The graphics are detailed, but usually display a whole lot of nothing, so everything just winds up looking messy. The NPCs try to come across as endearingly fleshed out and bold, but they come across way too strong right out the gate -before you care enough about them to WANT to hear them ramble or listen to their backstories - so every time you open conversation with a new one you just kind of sigh and dig in for a few more minutes of dialogue from people you don't care about, concerning a subject which may or may not have any importance at all. It makes me want to not talk to anyone at all, which is BAD for an RPG like this. It comes across more as work than enjoyment.  Characters can stick together and listen in on each others' conversations.... but as mentioned, a lot of the time the discussions don't go anywhere at all, and you have to either carefully pace things so that everyone can hear and understand it, or else power through, either ignoring the plot elements or being forced to explain it to everyone later.  The game just has way, way, way too much going on. You would think that would be a good thing - more detail and more mechanics means more interesting and unique potential interactions, right? But instead, the game just feels ike an outing at the garbage dump - full of stuff, but the vast majority of it not even remotely worth your time. Having lots of content isn't bad, but the pacing here is just.... miserable. Stuff needs to be introduced to players gradually, in managable segments, and when we are appropriately invested in those elements.   As it was, I was bored out of my mind the entire time my group was playing last night. To be fair, I was the only one who felt that way. Everybody else seemed to be having a good time, and the rest of the internet seems to love this game too. But, for the life of me.... I don't know why.  "

But for the average person, you likely will not enjoy this game.  I did not realize going I'd have to sink in literally hundreds of hours if I were to play this game to completion not to mention how text heavy it'd be (which would be great if the story was captivating enough but it just isn't).  This game is also very complex, not in hard way though, in a you're going to have to spend a lot of time managing everything to get the most out of the expirience.  Now the amount of detail that has gone into this game is truly amazing, like seriously, this game is a work of art; but it is wasted on anybody not super into this kind of subgenre of RPG.  So once again if you are one of the few people into this kind of game you will be in love like seriously this is easily one of the greatest RPGs of all time in that subcategory; but for the average RPG lover myself included it'll be too overwhelming and you just won't find yourself having very much fun or will be too daunted by the unreasonable time sink you'd have to put in to truly play through and enjoy the game.

181,Texas Ranger,83,4,1,March 14,Not Recommended,58.4,"Let's see, where do I start...  The controls are clunky. About a quarter of the time you don't click on what you want to click on. I've had characters run across the map instead of firing an arrow. This also applies to interacting with objects. Also, the inventory system is horrendous. Moving objects between characters is a complete pain, and you literally have to drag and drop if they're standing too close to each other (and the inventory screen 'conveniently' expands if you have lots of objects, so you might need to scroll between transfers). When trading, you can't key in the amount of cash you want to include in a trade so you're left with a scroll bar with ticks that are too large. Also, say you want to purchase an object for character 2, but character 1 is the one with the trading skills? If you change characters to take a look at their equipment, the trade closes.   It's buggy. I've had characters randomly lose the ability to talk to other characters - the dialogue boxes flicker on, then disappear, and you have to hunt for the latest save that isn't bugged.  It's slow. Like XCOM2, it wastes your time with pointless pauses between actions. A 'fight' can end up taking half an hour in the best case just because its so slow.  Lots of fake difficulty. There are plenty of fights where you simply can't plan ahead a turn or two, because some scripted event will take place. After you know it'll happen, you can exploit it and win. Typically, you're underpowered in fights, so its very luck dependent: if the AI 'decides' to focus your characters, you'll probably lose. Alternatively, if the enemy gets a few lucky rolls, it'll also wipe your party. And then you take another half hour for the fight because its so slow...  ""It's not hard. It's stupid."" Like flipping a coin until you get heads 100 times in a row is 'hard'."

Pros:  + Huge amount of content. + Options to customize the initial class of all the members of your party + Main story is interesting, and there are some side plots which deserve attention + Very good for hardcore RPG players  Cons: - Performance issues: be ready for long loading times, and fps drops whenever there are many enemies on screen, or fire. There's one place in the game where, if you decide to go to combat (there's a non-violent solution), it becomes just unplayable - Random encounters and combats: some of your team members will do your best to provoke the wrong people at the wrong time and wrong level - 'Fake open world' and excessive trial-and-error: the world is huge, but a lot of time is wasted iterating across the map until you find those missions you can actually do, which brings me to the next point - Progression system: there's a huge gap between a level and the next. If you are level 17, and your enemy 18, it's virtually impossible to win (unless it is a 4 vs 1 situation). Those differences are also reflected in the equipment you wear. Also, the game obbliges you to do many side quests which are irrelevant, or where the amount of XP is maximized only when you behave in a certain way. - Buggy: some items may not work as expected, some quests will not be updated/closed. It feels rushed, and I really hope they release a 'Definitive Edition' as they did with the first one - Clunky crafting system (does anyone even bother to craft?) and persuasion system (some un-persuadable enemies will give you dialogues with persuasion checks... what's the point?)  This is personal: - I am not a fan of the dual armor system, given that magic armor builds on top of the enemies elemental resistances.

187,Wolf Barrick,241,2,0,"November 12, 2017",Not Recommended,149.8,"Before I start, I want to say that I LIKE this game for the most part. This could have been much more great that it ended up to be, in my opinion of course. Just a side note: It's waaaay better to play this in single player even if Coop is available. Why? Well, I played with two other friends and we encountered many problems on the way, because the game seems to treat every character as a single player instance, so dialogs repeat for every single one of us and even Persuasion Checks has to be redone and since only one of us takes the Persuasion skill, everything goes to hell half of the time. That is really BAD! The game offers the choice of installing mods to ease up some of the, not so great, game mechanics. Too bad that those can corrupt your save file in a way that the game takes forever to load and your friends when joining (with the same mod installed) will have a huge desync problem. No hair, Nullify Resistances instead of Leadership, broken skills, an axe that for reason turned into a crossbow, a wooden figurine that is a spear that deals 2-3 damage... yeah, we've seen some weird stuff. We abbandoned the idea of playing coop again after this. Back to single player though, they made some changes from Dos1. Crafting does not require a skill, but it's still really poor in what you can do. You can craft yourself a new armor that has your level, but it would have been nice if you could create magic or even epic equipment to have some nice bonuses added to the, otherwise, fairly useless piece of junk you crafted. It would have been nice if I could improve my equipment through crafting too, outside of adding nails to boots, that was not bound to runes. Runes are nice, but I would have liked the chance to slot my equipment in order to fit them. They removed the Bodybuilding and Willpower skills and added the Physical and Magical Armor to protect you from ailments. Before we had a chance to being afflicted by CC statuses, now until your Armor is up you are completely immune to them. I seriously dislike this mechanism, the only thing that does is making enemies tankier and CC skills useless until you manage to break through their armor. No thanks, I know that having a chance calculated on a skill you have wasn't really great either, but I highly preferred that at that point. At least I could use CCs regularly to help me out. ""AI is smarter!"" Wrong, AI is either doing weird stuff or, especially during boss fights, shamelessly Cheating the system just to F*** you up. You have a maximum of 6 AP for turn, usually a normal character gets 4 AP a turn unless he has the Glass Cannon or Lone Wolf talent. You get a free point of movement if you have The Pawn talent. Well, you will see enemies move for kilometers and being able to use two spells (that usually costs 2 or 3 AP), move again and maybe even drink some tea out of spite of you. Everytime that happend I examined them with Loremaster 5 and found out that they had no Talents and their maximum AP was 6. Plus, some enemy doesn't seem to have any cooldown to his skills. That is just wrong... I get the idea of ""Battles are stacked against you"", but making the AI cheat to do that? That is just cheap, couldn't you do better than this? Let's not forget the times where a Melee opponent is able to strike you from way below you for reasons. I.E. ""Let's climb this ladder so he won't be able to strike my mage down since there won't be any line of sight!"", he attacked him anyway. Plus, if you play an undead character, nobody will know that you are one while in town an fully covered in armor. That is good, but if you enter combat, magically even the poorest sod in town will know that you are an undead and will cast upon you all sort of healing spells to wipe you out. That is cheap and dumb. Was the Loremaster skill on sale that everyone has it over the roof? I seriously disliked this. They added Character Tags in the game that adds unique dialog lines for your character and might help you doing some quests! Are they good? No. They're mostly useless and you won't need any of them except from Scholar and maybe Mystic. Scholar is direly needed if you want to complete all of the side quests you can find, Mystic is needed for one quest if I recall correctly and that's it. All the other Tags won't add anything to your game, the lines you say are quickly dismissed by the Npcs and won't open for you any Quest or available outcome of one. What was the point of them? Roleplaying the character. Sure, but it's pointless if most of the times your Tag choices doesn't create any consequence in the quest! Why should I bother? Combat mechanics are solid for the most part. Sometimes large enemies are an issue because of hitboxes, it happened to me that when I tried to hit an enemy, he would move for his animation and my character instead of attacking, moved to his side wasting an AP. Really want an Undo button for movement. I disliked the Source system a lot. Basically some skills, the higher tier ones, requires you to have and consume Source. You have a maximum of 3 points of Source that you can only acquire by stepping into Source puddles, using a Source fountain (there's only one for act, but it has infinite source in it) or using Source Vampirism on spirits, dead bodies or enemies if they are sourcerers. The skills you can use with source are good, but I felt way too limited since at some point every enemy mage will use Source Vampirism or Purge to drain you of all your source. Not a fan of Source, sorry. Quest wise the game offer you a lot of quests that you can complete. Too bad that there are a lot of quests, especially during Act 2 that are left unfinished and offers no satisfaction whatsoever and a feeling of ""That's it?"". There's a lot of breakable quests too. I lost count of the quests that didn't close in my journal because of reasons or quests that resulted in a dead end. It's nice that they added a lot of side quests, but it matters not to me if half of them are dead ends. Won't say anything on the story, since spoilers. I can say it's ok. The soundtrack is awesome, loved especially Lohse's song.  In conclusion, what I can say about this game is: Wait for an Enhanced Edition (if there's gonna be one) where MAYBE  they will polish this game and hopefully remove the problems I personally encountered.

Clicking on literally everything is very annoying, the camera is extremely annoying at times, and as someone who likes to experience the entire game, not just bits and pieces of it, there are too many quests that I can't really do without ditching a party member for another one or getting side tracked by another quest. This also goes along with not being able to do much if you're wanting to play a lone wolf. Some quests force you to travel with a partner. I get that you still get the lone wolf perk with one other companion, but this doesn't change that there are like... 5 different options for companions, all with quests. I simply felt there was too much going on in the first part of the game. I've no doubt this review will get bashed, but that is simply how I felt about it. The environment is ridiculous as well. I was constantly using rain to get rid of oil, fire, poison, etc. It is extremely annoying. I never really died to anything due to fire or oil, poison killed a couple of my characters, but I still ended up winning. To me it just isn't very well done and is quite the chore."

It's not a bad game per se, it's just the flaws in its design just become so irritating by the end of the campaign that I found myself just going through the motions and hate-playing it simply to finish the damn thing.  I feel like if you stripped out the campaign and left the assets and the DM mode and just sold it at a much reduced price it would really nail it as a multiplayer CRPG.  The irritations that got worse as I played was the lack of actual freedom in the game. Both in terms of dialogue options having no appreciable difference and the way that quests are intended to be done in a specific order. For example, if you are just free wandering through the map and come across a hostile NPC that is 2 or more levels higher than you, just reload your quicksave and make a note not to go there until you're 1 level higher than it. In each chapter there's about a 3 level spread that you need to deal with, and quests should be knocked off from easiest to hardest if you're not comfortable cheesing the heck out of the AI.  Each level represents a huge step up in damage output, resistance and general ability. I feel this is the weakest part of a game that supposedly prides itself on player agency. If you got rid of levelling altogether and made combat all about efficient and clever use of skills/equipment then the combat would be amazing.  Another annoyance that only gets worse is the journal. It's so vauge as to what you should be doing next, who to see, what level each quest is, and even if a quest can be completed in the current chapter you're in are completely omitted. Most of the time I ended up having to look through the wiki to solve a lot of quests. Half of which weren't even in the current chapter!  The voice acting is good, the writing ranges from passable to good. The plot is extremely generic. The graphics are pretty enough.

192,Szkeptik,216,7,4,July 16,Not Recommended,54.0,"As awesome as most of this game is I just can't recommend it because of the all-over-the-place difficulty it has. I play it on ""Classic"" difficulty (I guess it's supposed to be ""normal""). You might have a completely fun and interesting fight in one room, then move to the next and find yourself facing enemies with 3x more health and 2x more damage than your party have. They will often move first as well, and by the time the turn comes to you, your party is at half health and crippled/blinded/etc. I don't know if the devs intended these fights as a deterrant from higher level areas, but there's no indication that you are coming up against and unbeatable foe.   Not to mention a bunch of times the enemies will teleport in from nowhere with a proximity trigger like mechanism, so you can't even sneak up on them or know what you will be facing until you walk right into it. Even if you can somehow beat them, you can't do it immeadiately, but only after a couple of reloads when you already know exactly where they will spawn and what abilities they will use.  My personal assessment is that the level design was kind of sloppy when determining level progression and opponent difficulty. It's like you are always a level too low to face the next challenge and have to constantly backtrack to try and find some better gear or farm more XP in previous areas so you can progress.  I read that the solution is to itemise well, but the drops and market items are random, so you may or may not get the good stuff early. And if you don't you might as well start anew or reload some older save and try again because you will not be able to take on key fights. It reminds me a bit of the HoMM games where even on moderate difficulties you basically had to play a perfect game to have a shot at beating the AI.  All in all, unless you are some veteran RPG fan I'd definitely wait for a discount."

After four different fix attempts and a reinstall, the game still didn't work. The message from the devs on this was that they were looking into it...a month ago. Also, they recommend disabling anti-virus. I know you can grant special access to specific programs. The way they put it out, it was as if you should shut off your anti-virus completely. Just seems as if they didn't really give the problem due consideration and doesn't inspire confidence that they'd respond to user feedback either. It appears that many folks don't have this problem, however; I saw quite a few others on the forums in the same situation I'm in.

I really enjoy its story line, but the longer u have played, the more frustrated and angier u have gotten, because this game is containing a serious bug with missions, which caused your mission abort. I have wasted my half of the playing time because of it.  Pros: 1.******Great story******* 2.Nice Sound track 3.Mission rich 4.Outstanding combat style  Cons: 1. Missions bug, u couldn't finish the missions because of the missing dialogues' bugs. I encountered 8 mission bugs in driftwood (around 40 missions right there, 1/5 of the missions were abort at that time.), 6 in the Arya and 2 are about the main quests ( but lucky I could solve main story one by reloading the save.).  *** Really annoying*** u have to visit the game wiki online while playing this game, otherwise u got stuck. Save and reload couldn't fix the problem, even I restart the mission, the bug still caused your trouble. Thus, I had created 3 characters, one of them were deleted because of this ♥♥♥♥ing bug, another one's  for the experiment.  2.Dialogue/ sound suddenly went off. It could be another bug and need to be fix.  3.If you have ever played Fallout 4, then u are going to find out the same problem - Stupid dialogue option (not all of them, but it's around 40%), it usually lead to the same following dialogue whatever u have choosen differently.  For example, I was playing a male character, and there's a male npc blocking your way to enter the campus. At this moment, u had 4 choices( killing, persuasion, ***sexal attraction*** and leaving.) and I choosed the sexal attraction and it 's a success, but he described your male character as a female in the following dialogue, I tried this conversation with a female character and I got the same result. I am not sure it's a bug or not, so I gave another test with this npc ( High v.s. low persuasion), both of my characters still got the good result regardless the persuasion level.  4.Bugs on the buff states on your characters and allies. For example, a conjurer used a 2-turn damage buff on his pet.  1st turn: Pet action ended -> Conjurer used a 2 turns damage buff on his pet -> Turn end 2nd trun: Pet with dmg buff action ended -> dmg buff lost -> Conjurer turn -> Turn end Another example, u were attacked and got a burnning state by enemy. 1st turn: Hero action ended -> Enemy attacked your hero with fire ball -> U got a burning state (2 turns)  because of defeated magic armor -> Turn end 2nd trun: Hero action ended -> Hero burning state ( 1 turn) -> enemy turn -> Turn end 3rd turn: Hero action end -> Hero burning state lost -> ... There's the problem with the state turn counting between the + and - ve effect, + ve state last shorter than expected, hopefully, this is just a bug.  4. There's no difference on the enemy using charm / tanut skill, both skills cause your ally attack u. Charm- Causing your enemy attack his allies Taunt- Causing your enemy attack focus on u however, A taunted ally always choosed a high damage range skill or bomb to attack,  he wasn't focus on the enermy at all but on other heroes and dueling tons of damage on allies at that time. What a ♥♥♥♥ing joke!  5. Charm skill is♥♥♥♥♥♥ charmed enemy didn't do anything but walking around ( >50% time).  6. ♥♥♥♥ing stupid tags, different tags give different special dialogues, but only mystic and scholar tags are useful on the mission and u must have those 2 tags on the same chararcters to some missions. If u don't have a character with mystic and scholar tags at the same time, few missions u are going to miss or unsolve (only 1 or 2 can have an alternative way.). Two characters, who have mystic and scholar tags individually, couldn't solve the quest together, because u need a character with both tags. As a result, I have to build every character with those tags in each game.  What a regret on this game! I really wanted to recommend this game, but the mission dialogue bugs cause me wasting 50% of the gaming time, so I do not recomment this game at this moment, even it has a real ♥♥♥♥ing nice story. Unless there is a patch to fix the bug in the future, then I will recommend it."
206,devil,131,No,0,October 12,Not Recommended,112.7,"I'm not a fan at the moment, but that's just me. The game is pretty outstanding in most parts, but in the areas I bought it for, it seems to be quite lacking.  The role playing aspect looks pretty impressive. I'm not a big fan of some of that stuff personally, so I think a large part of the game has been lost on me. For example, the protagonist takes on a bit of a rebel/terrorist/survivor role early in the game and shortly after, I land in a new town/area. Someone from the corrupt law & order of the area calls me out! I've been identified! I have 3 options here. One is to surrender but that sounds lame, so I dont like that one. Second is to bribe them, but I want to hold on to my money so I don't like that either. Third is to attack the character who called me out, which I like! :D. But wait, the Entire Town goes hostile on me? Shop keepers to the beggers, everyone wants to kill me now... That quite sucks. From a role playing point of view, that makes sense I guess, but practicaly, this is a Terrible option! Totally lame! How often does an entire town go hostile if you pick the wrong dialog option? Why would they ever even put it there? Why would they put a mine in the middle of a peaceful road that insta-kills half your party? Why is there an area that enemies rediculously more powerful then you, 10 seconds of walking away from where you are supposed to be? Why is this bad guy who's 1 level higher then you able to 1-shot half your group?   Yeah, I felt like I had to reload my last quite save A LOT OF TIMES because of some variation of that. There are lots of ways to do things! But I felt a lot of them were a total waste of time.  So If you love role playing stuff, I think the game has a lot going for you.   Personally, I'm a big fan of the combat system and character development in RPGs. I had a lot of fun feeling like I was mastering the combast system in the first game and thought the new game would have the same combat system, or something basically the same but a bit more polished. Nope. Vastly simplified in my opinion and a lot less fun. I'm pretty sure that they wanted to more closely control the options that the player had for developing the plot, so they took a lot of complexity out of the combat system so that a level 10 creature can be beat by a level 10 party with a bit of focus, but no miracle. 1 level over? Pretty darn hard! 2 levels over? Just forget about it. 3 levels over? You're bascially trying to teach Mario how to swim in lava. The designers don't want to stop you from trying, but it's Very clear they don't want you going there. Likely because if you can skip areas, that will screw up your plot progression, which they put a lot of time and effort into.  It's like the game is giving me all these options of stuff I can do, wich is cool! But some of these options are apparently stupid and I shouldn't have picked them because I keep getting gibbed? Not a fan."

Enemies have high amounts of AP, less cooldown, and other cheats to straight up overpower your well thought out strategies. The game appears to only allow for a small subset of party combinations to be successful. Having little to no physical/magical armor in the beginning of the game is a huge handicap in combat.  The jump from classical to tactician modes is a huge leap. And it forces the player to cheese to even have a chance of passing. Expect a lot of reloads even on classical difficulty.

216,Terrainosaur,26,34,11,August 19,Not Recommended,138.8,"If DOS2 was a tabletop RPG, it would be the worst Game Master ever.  STAGED TRAPS Every battle is a trick. A lone person can call reinforcements from off-map who run right up next to you while you're stuck there unable to react. THEN combat starts. Ambushes are the most common fight. Sometimes the enemies aren't even there. They appear out of thin air to shoot you. Some situations are scripted, killing your whole party. You either get around them with exploits or avoid them. It's amazing how enemies always go first and have tons of action points, but if you try to ambush one of their sentries, their friends detect it from ANY distance and come running. You struggle to improve your basic gear and spells while monsters blast you with spells that are hard to find or create. Every enemy seems to be able to make opportunity attacks, but you have to spend points to get that.  STRAY CLICK? RELOAD! Undetectable traps kill your party. One was underneath a crate I accidentally picked up. I heard 'Look out it's a trap' at the same instant as the explosion. I wasn't even trying to move the barrel, I was trying to open it. If you accidentally click an item in town, the nearby NPCs immediately get a worse attitude to you. Sometimes they attack you, from just a stray click. This is a common theme. I cast poison the ground so my undead character could step on it to heal, but I didn't notice that was his last action point, so my click on the poison sent my NEXT character to run and stand in it. Then he was poisoned, the opposite of what I was trying to do.  HEROES NEED NOT APPLY Many NPCs will attack you if you fail your Persuasion check, even when you thought you were on the same side. There are no consequences of playing a serial killer. Nobody walks into a building, sees the bodies, and alerts the town guard. Lots of online advice is 'Turn in the quest, then kill the quest-giver for more experience.' I saved a man's life, then tried to put out the fire on his house with spells. He said I was damaging his house and attacked me. You don't play a noble adventurer or wicked thief, you play a scavenger. You have to enter every abandoned house and mouse over every spoon to see if it's worth taking. There are countless situations you can't do anything about, but they're designed to make you feel bad. Orphaned baby animals, children with incurable diseases, the poor and starving ... while you're spending piles of gold on the next magic dagger. I tried to heal a beggar and got killed for it.  ROLL YOUR EYES AT THE QUESTS Some quests are impossible to start unless you talk to the NPC with the right party member, or you're carrying the right random object, or you choose the right dialogue options. And you get one chance. There are lots of bugged quests, and quests you can't complete for arbitrary reasons. Countless objects seem useful but aren't, but you have to be extra careful not to sell things that later turn out to be quest items. The lore is garbage. So many books you find are random scribblings that have nothing to do with the story. Look at the title, it's a clue. 'Divinity Original Sin 2' doesn't tell you anything. The game encourages you to use exploits. It encourages you to break it not with tactics but with tricks like 'Teleport your whole party into a prison cell, then teleport the guards in, killing them one at a time. The guards don't have the key to the door! #lolsocool'.  AN EXPERIENCE LIKE CHEWING GRAVEL Expect to spend hours managing your inventory. No, you can't label bags to easily find your herbs. The load times are long, and I'm running it on a new gaming PC. The number of ridiculous, annoying tricks means you'll need to save and reload often. There's no way to speed up the animations. When the enemy summons skeletons which then summon more skeletons, you sit there for MINUTES before you get to act.  In short, Divinity Original Sin 2 is boring and annoying. There's so little PLAYING in this game. It's a non-stop joyless deathtrap designed to make you feel bad - while spending hours saving and reloading. I think the designers actively hate their own customers."
217,ElevatorEleven,203,3,4,March 19,Not Recommended,95.7,"The last time I played this game was a few weeks ago. I realized this when I noticed it again in my library today and came to the conclusion that I probably would never finish it.  I quite like this game actually. It promises rich story and narrative directed by player choice and obviously falls flat just like every game that promises such, but I could have gotten past it. Obviously a game can't have total freedom, and to its credit, Divinity Original Sin 2 has more freedom than most RPGs in several ways that can create some good fun.  The combat is nice too, turn based so slow at times, but with an emphasis on the planning and spatial strategy which compliment the lack of intensity. Battles must be won with careful tactics and preparation as well as using the current status of the environment to your advantage. A rain spell can make the ground wet, a contamination spell can poison the water, any fire spell can ignite the poison, another rain spell can turn the fire into concealing steam clouds, a lightning spell can electrify the clouds, etc.  Mechanically the game is alright, though not above bouts of occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when targeting and pathing and line of sight are concerned, but the narrative elements left me cold. Dialogue is a bit too ham for my taste and quality of writing is a few rungs lower than what I'd call acceptable, and it still ultimately trips over itself by promising too much freedom. By mimicking the style of tabletop as hard as it does it only shoots itself in the foot repeatedly when I keep thinking of things I ought to be able to do but the game engine won't let me.   A few examples jump to mind as particularly galling; near the start of the game a Bad Guy argues with a lady at the city gate and they give some exposition before the Bad Guy kills the lady and then leaves. It's possible to get into the town another way so the event doesn't trigger, and they stand there at the gate arguing basically forever until you come back. So it's possible to come back at a higher level once you've learned the spell that lets you teleport other people around. My first thought was to teleport the lady away so that the Bad Guy can't kill her, but the Bad Guy's attack apparently has infinite range, goes through walls, and doesn't require line of sight. One might suppose ""oh but clearly you're using an exploit if you get around this scripted event and try to come back to it later when you have a spell you shouldn't have."" But you'd be wrong, because it's possible to defeat the Bad Guy right there and she has dialogue for it and drops her super powered hammer, so obviously the designers intentionally made this possible but didn't think I'd try to save the doomed NPC.  I could list others, but really this isn't that big of a deal. For every time my friends and I got to say ""Man, they really should let us do this thing"" there were a good one or two times we got to say ""Boy I'm so glad they actually let us do this thing."" No, what made me put the game down was at the end of the first major chapter when I had the distinct displeasure of meeting Malady, an arrogant, boring, snotty and smug insufferable and invincible DMPC so obnoxious and poorly written that after being forced to spend the next hour of the game with her I could no longer bring myself to care what happens next in this story or to this world or to any of these other characters.   Every pretense the game had to offering me freedom was immediately shoved aside so the author's pet character could have the spotlight instead. An insurmountable problem appears (which I was well on my way to resolving on my own) and she insists we retreat because there's no way YOU could beat this enemy you silly little peasant, and I can't tell her to♥♥♥♥♥♥off and let me win this fight without her, she teleports us away and I can't call her out on it. She constantly acts completely bored with my saving the world from annihilation, she rubs it in my face how mysterious and wise she is like she has all the answers but won't tell me any of them, and if I even try to refuse to talk to her, she basically mind controls me into telling her what she wants to know. And of course, when I attack her, she just shrugs it off, turns invisible (preventing me from talking to her for a minute or two until she comes back, which stalls the game because talking to her is literally the only way to advance), and says ""Please, just don't"" like my attack that took off a third of her health in one hit somehow only bothered her as much as if I were a four year old kicking her in the back of the leg because obviously she's just so cool you guys. No other character has been invincible up to that point; you can kill shopkeepers, guards, random civilians, even the NPCs you can get to join your party if you talk to them, everybody you meet except for the children, which, fine, whatever, people get pissy if you let players kill children in your game I guess.  So naturally I immediately saved and quit and went to look up how to kill her and it looks like you can but only in a story cutscene somewhere so it's still on the author's terms and leads to a bad ending or something, and keeping her alive and talking to her a whole lot seems to be the only way to stop one of the recruitable NPCs who I kind of liked from dying later. Or something. I don't know the details of course, and I no longer care. I have the impression she would only get worse, and my involvement in the story would only decline as she took more and more center stage, because that's the kind of character she is, and even if I'm wrong about this it's already too late. Malady was such an awful and offensively trite character that she broke the spell, and my trust in the author is gone.  If you're some kind of deranged mutant who would like to explain to me why Malady is your waifu and are presumably someone who's never played Dungeons and Dragons with a crappy DM so you don't know how to spot one and haven't had the chance to ever feel that particular brand of hate and impotence, feel free to leave a comment and I will not read it."

220,ElevatorEleven,203,3,4,March 19,Not Recommended,95.7,"The last time I played this game was a few weeks ago. I realized this when I noticed it again in my library today and came to the conclusion that I probably would never finish it.  I quite like this game actually. It promises rich story and narrative directed by player choice and obviously falls flat just like every game that promises such, but I could have gotten past it. Obviously a game can't have total freedom, and to its credit, Divinity Original Sin 2 has more freedom than most RPGs in several ways that can create some good fun.  The combat is nice too, turn based so slow at times, but with an emphasis on the planning and spatial strategy which compliment the lack of intensity. Battles must be won with careful tactics and preparation as well as using the current status of the environment to your advantage. A rain spell can make the ground wet, a contamination spell can poison the water, any fire spell can ignite the poison, another rain spell can turn the fire into concealing steam clouds, a lightning spell can electrify the clouds, etc.  Mechanically the game is alright, though not above bouts of occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when targeting and pathing and line of sight are concerned, but the narrative elements left me cold.

221,Amigo,142,14,2,"September 21, 2017",Not Recommended,81.6,"""I have a study to explore...""   If there's a single word to describe this game, that would be the word ""TEDIOUS"". I didn't like the first one. I thought it was overrated. I wanted to try this one partly because there were no new RPGs around. I wish I didn't. This game is the same chore as the first one. Playing this game for me is like grinding through many obstacles just to catch a glimpse of that old role playing feeling which this game certainly has.  The story. At it's core it's really similar to that of Baldur's Gate. Take Bhaalspawn and put Godwoken instead. You even start at a prison. Except the story in Baldur's Gate felt epic. In this game it doesn't. In Baldur's Gate 2 you had the prison, the huge city of Alkathla with it's several districts, de'Arnise Hold, Umar Hills, Trademeet, Spellhold, City of Caverns, The Underdark, Forest of Tethir Areas, Windspear Hills, Suldanessellar, The Nine Hells. What do you have in this game? I don't know really. 2-3 maps? Oh yeah, I forgot. You have a study to explore!  The voice acting. I have no idea why they made the decision to voice act every single dialogue line in this game. Was it really necessary? They wanted to impress people and boost sales? They had an excess of money to spend? This was not necessary. Like everyone in this game speaks such perfect English it's ridicuolus. Lizards speak like they are gentlemen from Westminster Abbey. Skeletons - the same. All characters sound similar. That's not what's called good voice acting. Like come on all you had to do was to add a little flavour to voice acting. Make lizards have their own manner of speech. The same for skeletons and elves. Probably dwarves too. Just voice act one line of dialogue but add flavour to it and make it count. In this game everyone sounds as generic as they can. I still remember the voice acting of one character from Baldur's Gate 2 - Tortured One, in a prison. Or Minsc. Was he fully voice acted? No, but he was so alive and had a tremendously distinctive character. With vocie acting in this game all characters can transform into a single word blob.  The pacing. It's extremely slow. Fights take forever to finish. Characters move like they are premanenlty overburdened. Every turn of the road on the map has containers/enemies/NPCs. It is the core design. To create less and to make it feel like it's a lot. Even that ghost vision. Man, it's such cheap trick. Press a button and you'll get another bunch of characters to interact with in the same places you've already been. ""But, I have a study to explore!"", you say. Indeed you do.  The gear. Gear in this game? Honeslty I felt like I was playing an MMO. Who gives a sheet? You find a so called ""legendary"" item in a chest, equip it. And then you find a blue item which is better in a chest next to it. It's just swapping gear with higher stats, that's what it is. There's no excitement in finding a new good item because you know that soon you will find a new one, a better one.  Progression system. We all know RPGs are about getting your character to new heights, learning new powers, abilities, etc. The important thing for developers is to make a player feel powerful as he progresses and develops his character. Yes, this game has a ton of abilities and powers. Yes, you do progress and get new ones. The issue is you don't feel powerful. There's always a group of mobs with higher level than you ready to make a meat stew out of you. Every fight is a tedious struggle with enemy at advantage. It makes all your glorious efforts feel a bit useless.  I could go on pointing out other weak spots of tediousness in this game. Like inventory system (oh my God, it's awful!), companion management, UI in general, crafting (what crafting? wait, there's crafting in this game?) etc. But it all comes down to this. If you are a masochist hungry for a new RPG and not afraid of grinding your way through inconviniences with a snale's pace, be my guest - buy this game, play it, explore a new study. Otherwise - AVOID, save your time. Wait for other RPGs."

In another fight I was stuck with zero AP just because I used Fane's Time Warp (another well known bug).  I gave up the game at end fight just because I could not take it any more.

223,AARosson,975,6,1,"December 28, 2017",Not Recommended,12.9,"Divinity: OS2 has a lot of promise but in my eyes fails in one way that breaks the game. The enemies Scale to your Lvl. This might seem like something good to keep the game challenging but breaks the game when you realize no matter how many side quest you do, you will never be strong and gaining levels only hurts you. What’s the point of progression if you are always just as strong as everyone else...?   The game has good bones, its engine works great and makes you wish they could have made a D&D or Pathfinder game rather than the story given mostly because it seems like the developers didn't care to much about it. I have a hard time caring about the story because if you have played other Divinity games you find that they have changed the nature and back stories of the races in it. I loved playing Dragon Commander because I got to learn about the generals, politicians, races, and your wife in the game. If you played Divinity 2 you learned a lot about the races in the world of Divinity and it seems like all that got thrown out.  Does the game look pretty? Yes. Does the combat work well? Yes? Does the game have an interesting Story? Yes?  But I can Also Say,  Combat works well but you will never feel strong or any need to become stronger because the enemies will just be stronger.  The Game looks pretty but when you put on a hat you grow long hair and your face changes.  The interesting story, if you start asking questions and talking to everyone, contradicts its self and changes. The story jumps all over the place and makes you wish you could just pull out a fishing pole and fish at the ocean and forget the story all together.  In general, I love RPG's and I hate that I hate this game but that is that.   I am also appalled at all the great reviews. The game is not a perfect game by any means regardless if you liked it or not it has a lot of problems, reviewers today need to be more honest.  Why is this game getting 10/10? It’s not a 10/10… I rate things either Unplayable or Playable.   This game is unplayable.  As in, I didn't find it fun and what is the point in playing if its not fun. "
224,Jynx,122,17,1,"September 16, 2017",Not Recommended,93.4,"This game is not just not that fun to play. Everytrhing feels needlessly complex without a real payoff. The menus are a pain to slog through. I constantly struggled to get the camera in the right spot to see anything. And good luck findning anything. You have to press a key to see items and that doesn't show half the stuff you actually want to pick up. For such a complex game, you really need extensive intro to game mechanics to have the faintest clue what is going on and that is not present.  Just as an example, lets say you want to sell items. Great, so almost every NPC you meet is a vendor with some gold and items to sell. So that means you have to click on every NPC to see what theyre selling. And when you want to sell you have to move all the gear to the character with the bartering skill so you can sell it at max price. Theres a good chance that all your gear is actually on the character with thievery (because he steals stuff and opens chests) or the one with high wits that you use to spot hidden treause and traps. So have fun moving all your gear between characters that all have individual carrying capacity and inventories full of potions and scrolls.  This game seems to be meant for a small subset of gamers that like a really heavy story-driven rpg with super complex mechanics and don't mind all the difficulties that come with no limits on what you can do. There's a reason conventions like group inventory or merchant NPC's or skill trees exist - they save the gamer time so they can go do the fun stuff like exploring the world and story. Suffice it to say, I see the promise in this game and if some of its underlying gameplay was changed to be more user friendly I would gladly enjoy the story. Instead I feel set adrift among a host of unexplained, needlessly comlex game mechanics without direction as to where to go or if I'm doing something wrong."

226,Lithbane,37,9,3,"December 24, 2017",Not Recommended,106.4,"I was gonna write this long post about what basically ruins this game for me. Again, my opinion, don't get triggered. I think this is the most overhyped and poorly made cashcow of a game ever. The devs were so lazy in making the quests that even murdering every NPC in all of Rivellon doesn't even matter, they just respawn in each act with crippling alzheimer's syndrome making them forget it all. I dropped a deathfog crate in act 4 on top of all the paladins and they just kept walking into it giving me that sweet, sweet EXP. Then some random paladin woman asked me if I was behind the murders, which of course I denied, being a lone wolf character on the hardest difficulty and having maxed out finesse because stacking archers in this game with finesse + wits is entirely broken in every way conceivable, especially when Fane can just grant himself another turn after the first and always be first because wits = initiative. And I succeeded in convincing her that I was, in fact, not behind the murders of her ENTIRE PALADIN ORDER because I had 5 in persuasion, basically the only stat you need to max out every time. This kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥happens throughout the entire game, with most NPC's literally being useless and lifeless with no character traits whatsoever. Combat is a complete joke, rogues/summoners/necromancers don't even need to exist. Polymorph needs 2 points to access every broken spell in the game. The entire game's story has these insanely stupid plotpoints that are supposed to be shocking, like Dallis being Fane's daughter (foreshadowed exactly nowhere and cared about by exactly noone). It's like they are missing 50 pages of text in this game. I have so many examples of the bad or straight up missing writing in this game, it's like the devs used most of the budget to go on pool parties or something.   So basically, combat sucks on any difficulty (with tactician + honor mode basically being ""ENEMIES HAVE 50% MORE HP"" sort of lazy, typical♥♥♥♥♥♥that you should never find in a carefully crafted RPG such as this one). The story is a sad, unfunny joke, with few redeeming characters that actually make you care about them (only Lohse and Red Prince to my knowledge have proper endings to their stories, both being decently written. Beast's story can actually proceed without him being alive and end the exact same way it does if he was.) There are far, FAR too many characters that are interesting at first glance but, woops, look at that, some pages went missing! Too much effort to find those it seems! From Lucian himself to basically an entire camp of EXP fodder characters with barely any story related to them or ways to finish quests related to them without just straight up KILLING them. But oh, this game was definitely carefully crafted and wonderful, especially the part where I could teleport NPC's while talking to them with one character and make most fights an even bigger joke than they were initially. And finally, gear in this game is the most pathetic attempt at skipping work I have seen. They basically just put RNG loot everywhere and didn't give two flying ♥♥♥♥s about making more custom weapons or armor that are actually worth getting BECAUSE OF THE RNG LOOT EVERYWHERE. I also love it when talents become useless past the point where they clearly stopped trying, which is basically act 2, because they just couldn't be asked to  write anymore quests that are worth a damn (R.I.P Pet Pal). And let's not forget the always useful and prefered talents such as ambidextrous, which is great for when you want to do a grenade only playthrough with a one handed weapon only! Oh wait, that sounds tedious and stupid? Well, sucks for you, most talents ARE tedious and stupid, with no real usage over obviously better ones (Bigger and better). This game is only truly likeable by hardcore fans and people who tend to be bad at RPG's. Also those who like to delude themselves they didn't buy a crappy product that clearly has way less merit than people brandish it with.  TL:DR Combat sucks, story sucks with some small exceptions, class and talent balance sucks, difficulties suck, detailing on the world is poor gameplay wise and nothing you do has any impact on the ending and most, if not all of the game, including purging all of Rivellon for EXP GAINS is entirely viable and goes unpunished in any way. Voice acting is amazing though.  Final thoughts, do not buy this game if you like good story, a real, fair challenge or have played basically any other RPG with above toddler level difficulty enabled. Buy it if you have already managed to find the missing 100 pages of backstory and quest dialogue, as well have an idea how to patch the game into some form of balanced state where I can't oneshot the final boss in two turns on the hardest difficulty. Or, you know, if you just really like good voice acting."
227,Shabby,165,9,3,February 12,Not Recommended,111.3,"Cant recomend. While the first act is tight and well crafted, offering you some inetersting story bits as long as you are willing to search for them and have the right NPC for them. But to be honest the whole game goes down hill fast once you get to level 5-6 because some major things happen. Crafting becomes usless, you will never need to craft anything in the game (Except a rare potion if you are not running hydrosophist), nor can you upgrade your arms and armor anymore as you could in the first game. Now, lets encounter an interesting thing i found in this game near the end of the act 1. You will find and fight a particular npc, and i made sure he was dead, i killed him, made him explode in a burst of blood smoke and meat bits, as well as tearing off his face. Yet he apears alive and well a few seconds latter, while the NPC around it say: ""Yeah, you did not kill him, he is allive."" And once you kill him again the NPC go: ""Yeah... he escaped, his boddy disapeared."" At this point i realised that you cant kill any important NPC and nothing you say will influence the main story except at  particular key points. In another addition to problems of this game is: The tone is harsher, but it does not work for the story the game tells. Going in to minor spoilers the game deals with the questions of faith, trust, divinity (obviously) and use of mass weapons of destructions, bloodshed, racism, religious zelotry and just cruelty. I think you can see why the tone can be incosistent and why the grimer and darker tone does not work for the tail of Faith, Trust and Divinity. And the game really tries to keep hammering down the point that: ""THIS IS A GRIM WORLD, WE WANT TO BE LIKE DARK SOULS!"" But its more like salt and sanctuary, throwing strung up corpses and skeletons and other gory stuff to create an atmosphere. The perks got cut down and now there is way less of them and some of them are just pointless, like ice king and demon, or ambidextry and slingshot.  Persuasion boiled down from a little game of rock, paper, scissors in to a skill check that... granted, makes no god damn sense. If there is a persuaion event you will get dialogue options that will have [Strength], [Dexterity] or [Intelegence] or any other stat before them, and you know what? They might as well have removed those little stamps, because they do nothing, if you have 50 strength and the persuasion event requieres 1 persuasion and you have 0, you will loose. Some of them are imposible and some of them are an auto pass, and while it does make sense, it points to the fact that there is no need in having persuasion as your social stat, especially considering that you get so few points. Socail skills (or stats): The only ones you need are Lucky charm, Thievery and Loremaster. Everything else is usless, and not like it even matters, you can change your character stats any time you want once you get in to the second act. What else? What else? Ah, yes, the armor. Its an awfull idea, while the first game was more about resistance and chance, this game goes bananas and says: Its all or nothing! So you can get yourself stunned for 8 turns in a row and hate your life. Also there is... something going on with the game where you can get stunned or frozen out of nowhere. The quests are rather boring and there is not much way of completing them other then the single way it was ment to be finished. Some of them cant even be finished, for some reason. In addition i must add that there are major techincal problems like the game taking 5 GB of ram and dying, on the regular bases, stutters and freezes, and some times your saves might actually not save, so check for that twise, i lost about 4-5 hours of progress in a coop game because of that. The second act is a mess, its just a bunch of stuff thrown around with no direction, its like your high scool budy wants to create a DnD sandbox adventure, and does not make any hooks for quests, so you end up aimlesly wondering around and talking to NPC in search of a thing to do. Companions are wierd, while i have been playing a lone woolf with Ifan on my side i found that he takes my acts of friendship like an excuse to put something up his bumm. At one point we got in to a conversation at one of the ins, he got himself and my character a cup of ale (or beer, does not matter), and procided to make conversation, at one point he said: ""Its good to have you by my side"" or some such, and i decided to answer: ""I enjoy your company"", now i thought its going to be like: ""Yeah, its nice traveling with you, you are after all of great assist in battle and your sharp wits keep our spirits up during the travel"" Ifan took it as: ""You want smash?"" and procedeed to blush. I might add that i was playing a 2.4m male bright red lizzard. So the only one receaving smashing would be Ifan.  So far i got to the end of Act 1 and... i really cant recomend the game for any one looking for a good time with an RPG, i would rather sugest playing the first game and droping it half way thro. Thats the best time you are going to get with this series."

It probably is the single best isometric rpg for it's first 2 acts and then drops in quality. Hard.  Sadly even the definitive edition did little to fiix this. The combat system of d2 is briliant. The plot is great. the love for detail in the first 2 acts is awesome.  BUT: The 3rd act is an insult to people who played through the first 2. Questlines are not written out, there are uncharacteristic plot twists and very limited room to make any choices. The only logical choice in this act always seems to be ""just kill everybody"" as choices are just that black and white. The last act is again much better however disappoints in the end. Because d2 has no ending. The game just stops. The story is not concluded, your descisions seem to have had little impact in the final ""what happens after..-scene"", character developement seems to not have happened in the epilogue... a very confusing and lackluster climax of what could have been one of the all time greatest.  Voting ""don't recommend"" to even the odds here. In truth the game is very much worth your time, even if only for the first 2 acts. You can drop it after that."

243,tntwhovian,103,10,0,October 14,Not Recommended,28.7,"The first game was amazing. Sometimes very long and you could lose your way a bit, but overall great. This sequel lost everything that made the first so fun and unique. 1. Character decisions no longer affect the character at all. There's very little interaction between the characters period and few to no choices.  2. It's too easy to get into fights you cannot possibly win from the very beginning. The first game was about strategy and you were never forced into a confrontation you couldn't win. You could avoid it or put it off or do any number of things (with one exception). This game forces you into them ALL THE TIME. It's so stacked for the enemies it's ridiculous. Charmed characters can go through and use all your scrolls and anything in your inventory? BS.  3. It is ridiculously hard to find anything useful in the world. No potion bottles, no craft items, no place to cook. Resurrection scrolls are vital (considering how many OP opponents you face from the beginning) but ridiculously scarce. I've been stealing anything of value anywhere I go and I still have barely enough to do anything when I happen to run across useful items being sold.  4. It's almost impossible to figure out what you're supposed to be doing when. Map markers don't update, quests logs aren't even quests with directives.   5. The armor system completely removes the game from the original, more DNDesque combat type. In the original, status effects were based on a combination of %chance to resist (from your character stats) and %chance to succeed (also from stats) and then a random number roll from the difference. It meant needing to be flexible and have more strategy and plans because you couldn't guarantee a status would take effect. Now you have to deal with a disappointing selection of armor for yourself and enemies with 4x as much armor as you and status effects that will always ♥♥♥♥ you over.  6. The attribute and skill system was simplified so much it removed any nuance or character balancing. A tank can just stack on constitution and vitality and warfare and do nothing else. Except the combat makes tanks almost pointless anyways because you can only taunt right next to you and the enemies are never even mostly right next to you.   tldr; this is a terrible version of the first game, aka a typical disappointing sequel"
244,0000000,91,11,0,"September 13, 2017",Not Recommended,28.3,"Good, classic CRPG gameplay (with just a BIT too much emphasis on environmental effects, which at the lowest or highest levels can overpower all of your leveled-up and carefully decided weapons/spells/etc), with poor story telling.  The reason why Divinity always had an asterisk next to it (and why I never finished the original while finishing Dragon's Age Origins probably 5x or so) is because I never got the story, or, to be more precise, its setting. It was always very 1, cringey (Cyseal is a cringy name for a town, please, stop it with the lower class dumb English accents, same patterns persist here as well), 2, weird and scattershot (you'd have Colonial-era boats intermixed with swords and spells-type aesthetic, you'd have all kinds of races in the story with little rhyme or reason), there never seemed to be any reconciled, singular story of the ""world"" as it was, that made sense, like LOTR does, like DA:O does, like WOW does, like all of these pretty straightforward Fantasy settings do, 3, weird (the names ""Divinity"" and ""Original Sin"" always evoke parallels with the Bible, and I don't know about you, but for me the Bible is about as much at odds with Fantasy as anything can possibly be)  So please, whoever is in charge of the franchise, get rid of it. The legacy of the setting is so strong that it poisons everything around it. The ""Divinity"" franchise came out of the Divinity: Dragon Commander game, which doesn't sound like a good foundation to build ANY fantasy epic on. That's not a game to be used as a blueprint for future games, especially in the RPG genre for F's sakes.   Restart the franchise with a setting and a narrative system that MAKES SENSE, because I immediately disconnected from the first game, even though it was STRAIGHT up my alley, just because of how cringy and awful the setting was. And no, you can't patch it up and call it done, get rid of all of it, and start with a map, a world, a few races, a crisis, some supernatural figures maybe, and that's it. Look at LOTR or DA:O for reference. I just can't recommend a game with a story in this disastrous state."
245,Barabus the Grey,175,11,9,October 9,Not Recommended,42.8,"I am not quite sure where to start, as a long time CRPG player from the first Baldurs Gate to planescape torment and ice wind Dale etc, I find myself frustrated and board with this game. Now please note that I really wanted to like these games and I think I have given them a fair shot as i stopped DOS 1 on the 3rd act and this game on the 2nd. Firstly I got interested in this series because of all the Baldurs Gate comparisons and yet this game does not in any way feel similar or even distantly related to those games. The advertising was just complete BS, by trying to lure in the RTWP crowed and I feel a bit betrayed and sucked in. And the developers themselves saying this game is our Baldurs Gate 2 haha, sorry bros but DOS 2 can't even scratch BG2 butt let alone compete with it. In fact I find it kind of insulting that they can even think this piece of meh can even compete with that masterpiece.  Besides all that I did play the first game and I got to the third chapter and gave up due to boredom. In fact I enjoyed the first game a lot more than i did this one, it seemed to have more charm i'm not sure exactly why.  Now I did only get to the start of chapter 2 here so take my review with a grain of salt and understand that this is all based of the first third of the game. So anyways the pros:   I do have to give praise for the amount of voice acting, and having the narrator as well is a welcome and much needed aspect to these types of RPG's, and for the most part it's pretty top notch.   The atmosphere is well done and does a good job of immersing me into the world and enviroments.   I do love the amount of options this game gives you to get through any given situation and how it rewards you for being inquisitive and trying things you normally wouldn't in most games and I think that is admirable, and Kudos to the devs for putting in the effort. More RPG's need this kind of depth in their mechanics.   Cons: I am at odds with the plot of DOS 2 as it is pretty simple, but well told. However it is just not interesting, and I find myself just zoning out when the story parts are playing. Maybe it gets better later I don't really know but judging from the first game I doubt it. The whole game feels overdesigned and not in a good way, the weapons the armor the spell effects are so flashy that it ends up just looking stupid and over the top. So I find that it kills my immersion as usually I prefer more grounded and gritty styles. I will admit that this just a preference thing and is subjective but I just feel that it is flashy for flasy's sake. Again nothing like BG The graphics and art style are nice but most of the environments are bland and not very interesting to look at or explore. Music is hit an miss but mostly not very memorable  The combat is also one of the biggest issues for me. Now I don't normally like turn based combat so again this is subjective, so If you do like turn based combat then you will probably like this. I can tolerate turn based combat if the rest of the game is good enough for me to keep me engaged and I have played other turnbased RPG's and enjoyed them so don't get the wrong impression here, it's just that the combat here feels like filler to turn a 10 hour game into a 100 hour game and to me this is just terrible design over all. Now I love my RPG combat but this is all you will be doing for %95 of the game and it gets old fast. My biggest issue with the combat is that enemies have so much HP and they are just bullet sponges for lack of a better term. so every combat encounter takes for ever and it's just exorsting and not fun, which is a shame because i think this game has one of the best Tun Based systems I have ever played. Also nothing like Baldurs Gates RTWP system. In most RPG's if the characters are good I can forgive a middling story but unfortunatley the characters here are not intersting at all, except for the red prince who I did find intrigueing but it wasn't enough to carry mr through this drudgery. They are reasonably fleshed out with back storyes and personal agendas which is nice but again it just falls flat and they feel devoid of any personallity.    The trading and bartering system is a chore, simple things like this should not take so long and require so much effort just to buy and sell, jesus! Now I get that this game does not hold your hand and I appreciate that but crist a little bit of guidance here and there would be nice and go along way in making this game more enjoyable. Most of the time knowing what to do and where to go is half the frustration I have with DOS 2 and the journal is just walls of text with no helpful information at all. You can easily miss key information about quests during dialogue if you are not payng attention which is easy to do if your constantly zoning out due to bordem like I was, but at least give people an option to turn on decent quest hints to help those who may not care about reading walls of text. And some people don't have a good enough memory to remember small little details that they came across 2 hours ago in amongst 20 pages of dialogue for 10 different quests. Options are alwsys a plus.   Overall this game just feels like a cumbersome, frustrating, monotonous time sink that wants to waste my time, the game has a nice charm and good atmosphere to suck me in but all of it's mechanics and systems just infuriate me and psuh me away which is a damn shame because I really wanted to like this series and I did have enjoyable moments with it but they are just drowned out by all the bad.  Oh and yeah and in case you didn't get it it's nothing like Baldurs Gate.  "
246,Rassy,162,8,4,June 24,Not Recommended,176.4,"Divinity is a fantastic game, but I can't give it a positive rating after the♥♥♥♥♥♥hand I was dealt in the final section of the campaign...    The ending was completely rubbish in a multiplayer situation    The game was amazing right through, I played it through with one of my mates and we went straight through the entirety of Arx with no issues.  Only main issue I can see with the game is that many puzzles and sections of the gameplay felt as though they weren't fluid and extremely unintuitive. Many sections required me to browse the wiki pages as I spent ages puzzling over them and couldn't figure it out at all.   ALONG WITH THIS    The journel was pretty unhelpful and didnt tell us how to complete issues. I'm not asking to be handed puzzle answers but having nothing to go on makes the whole situation drawn out and irritating to complete   Rescuing Arhu was a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥mission, he spawned in extremely weakened and then was focused by Kemm and immediately killed, saving him was a nearly unatainable achievement.   Now...with my nitpicking aside...for the finale.   The ending obviously results in one of you ascending to divinity, however for multiplayer at least the ending is disappointing, not everyone is a loner who plays with 3 bots for a 100 hour campaign -_-  We spent forever fighting Braccus Rex and then we were treated to a tasty 1v1 where who ever got the first turn won. My friend won the fight due to turn based inconsitency and ascended.   As the loser, you are stuck on the sidelines. I didn't even get to watch the ♥♥♥♥ing cutscene for ascension, I was just teleported to the lady vengeance and expected to twiddle my thumbs while the other gets to watch. It sounds nitpicky but when you have spent ages working through a long♥♥♥♥♥campaign you need payoff of some sort. I got nothing, no cutscene or anything.   The entire game rested on a fight that lasted 10 seconds and went to whoever got the first turn. That is stupid and I cant accept how brief it was.   Its a fantastic game but for multiplayer there are changes that need to be made to the final fight. It was a serious buzzkill."
247,Erbs,90,8,1,"September 24, 2017",Not Recommended,84.0,"This is the first time i have felt the need to write a review of a game due to the total mis-infomation out there.     There are many reviews of this game saying that this is the best thing since sliced bread or ""Game of the year 2017""....  Do NOT believe a word of it, this game is far from it. That's not to say that at the heart of it this is not a great game, but this game is not a finished product.    Let me do my best to expain what is wrong with a few examples, I will do my best not to give any spoilers...  First is that many reviewers are comparing this game to the likes of DA:Origins, which was one of the reasons I purchased it myself, well it's not even close...  A game from 2009 has this game licked in every possible way apart from the graphics are slightly better in this but a modded version of DA:orgins sorts that too.  Right from the get go this game gives you no info or any real expalanation to anything from character creation to 10 hours into the game.   The fact it has no hand holding by itself is not a problem and to many RPG fans including myself this didnt seem like a hurdle, i've been playing games for nearly 30 years I was sure i could work it all out. Well im about 15+ hours into the game (Steam seems to say less but meh...) and ive realised my Team/Group and my lead hero are just total failure.   See once you play the game for a while you suddenly realise that the combat in the game, although feels tatically correct, if your team is not full of ranged classes then you will get wiped out for the most part. The problem is with the way combat works in general, as in enviromental elements are so massively more important than what class you play or what you do with it.  E.g you can have a rogue with everything going for it but it will hit like a wet noodle and constantly die.  Now compare that to a ranged Mage/Ranger that can fire a fire spell to light up the enviroment and just kill everything including ""your"" Melle :) This then brings you squarely to the next issue and that is the AI that you will be fighting.... It's good..... Great you say... Well yes but every single mob from a simple beast to a named Elite runs with that great AI so you feel like your fighting the same mob with a differnet skin.   Now couple that with the fact that every mob from a dumb thug to a Top notch wizard is given loads of abilities... SO everyone and their mother can teleport/stun/cripple etc etc What this means is you will find yourself in just about every fight dealing with stupid amounts of CC and fire and eviromental effects everywhere melting your team.  Thus why i mentioned earlier that you will want to start using only ranged and cheese fights which makes you feel cheap. All this then means that for the most part you may lose one or two of your team so you will want to res those people... Well thats not that easy, unlike many other games where once combat has ended and you have won your fallen comrads will dust themselves off and you can heal up and move on......    Not here, you will need to use a Scroll of Resurection on each of your dead team mates which are very expensive and rare.   What this means is even if you manage to get through those tough combat areas you are still going to have to re-load a previous save because you lost someone to some cheap mechanic. Now i do appreciate there are going to be people reading this and thinking ...Wow this sounds great and i like difficult games..... This game is NOT difficult it is Frustrating ....those are two different things.   I have been playing this game on ""Normal"" and the difficulty is bang on, if i want it more difficult there are 2 higher difficulty settings.   However banging your head against a brick wall due to bad design/cheap mechanics/bugs is just pure frustrating.  Talking of bugs and other annoyances.... and there are plenty, way too many for me to list. Some are just niggles but some are just a royal pain.   These go from bugs while in combat of spells not firing off and instead your character walks off into fire or does something else unwanted.  All the way to serious bugs in quests not completing having to walk away and back again multiple times until the game triggers something, NPC's not responding to completed quests until you re-load or click on them multiple times. This actuall brings me to another problem which is dialogue in the game, it is handled on a ""Per"" character system so you can actually talk to the same NPC with all your team members, in theory this i a nice touch e.g NPC X won't talk to me because im Human but will talk to my Lizard friend.  The problem is like most things in this game which are good in ""theory"" the execution is poor and what you are left with is a conversation which you end up repeating 4 times just to see if anything is different.  This again would not be a problem if it felt right but what usually happens is you just have to repeat all the same conversation choices you just did not knowing if the NPC will register your first characters conversation or the last. Once again this brings me nicely on to my next complaint.... Dialogue choices ... theres loads and they all feel great when your clicking on them until you realise for the most part it doesnt make any difference and there is only one outcome to the convesation then that is whats going to happen...period.  There are multiple smaller problems like UI is poor, Inventory is badly handled and quest/journal tracking is bad at best, none of which by themselves is that bad but once you start grouping all this with many of its other bad parts you end up with a mess of a game.  Now please believe me when I say I write all this with a heavy heart because the game makes you ""Want"" to love it and you will try everything to like it but there comes a point when there is just too much wrong. The annoying part is if the Devs took this game and spent a couple of weeks ironing out the problems, removing some of the poor combat elements and fixed bugs etc then this game could be something special.... the potential is there.... just not now and for the price tag of £30 .... hell NO.  However i do believe that maybe in 6 months time im sure the modding community will have this game where it needs to be and i can come back here and change my review.....  I hope..... "

Due to the nature of the autosave frequency, it could set you back quite a ways in the game by having to go back to a stable save.  As I said this has happened about a dozen times in the 50 hours I have lovingly poured into this game.

Within a few hours play you have 4 characters each with a considerable list of usable magic/skills, but as every battle is a slog where a wrong move can mean defeat trying out a new skill can often get you killed. Morphing an enemy into a chicken sounds fun, but not so much when it just fails and costs you the battle. Things are very poorly explained as well, maybe that enemy just can't become a chicken... who knows. It is a game that requires a lot of experimentation and trial and error, but gives little oppertunity to do this without frustration.   "

This is the first title that I didn't enjoy and didn't even finish. Why?  - The story and the characters are dull and too serious. It's lost it's sense of humor, making it just another fantasy RPG.  - It's too easy, even on the hardest difficulty.  - The elements are unbalanced. Water + aero is way way way more powerfull then fire + earth/poison. And physical damage is even more OP. A ""jack-of-all-traits-master-of-none""team just doesn't work here. This takes away variety in combat, making every fight feel exactly the same as the previous one. - Inventory management is a pain. - Lizards don't fit in as humanoid characters. I enjoyed playing undead though! - [FIXED] The final act is just plain boring. I couldn't finish it. Fortunately they're redoing the whole act in the DE.  - No Bellegar!!!!  (apart from a small reference on the starter island) and where are Zandalor, ZixZax and others? Only a companion from the previous game makes an appearance, but he's not very iconic to the series.   I wouldn't recommend this version of the game, but I have high hopes for the DE. I'll give that one another go and hopefully I'll find the immersion I'm looking for. :)  EDIT: Unfortunately DE didn't deliver what I had hoped to get from it. Technically they didn't fix any of the things that bothered me for pc and the combat is still imbalanced. I did start a new playthrough in DE, but didn't make it past half of Act 2. This means I haven't experienced the revamped final act, so I can't review that. One positive: they did make the story a lot smoother and they added a handy tutorial."

264,Za,332,2,0,"November 29, 2017",Not Recommended,5.9,"This is more of a first impression review as I've not even finished the starting area but so far I'm not very impressed with how the game actually plays. I enjoy the story fine and the voice acting is wonderful though. But having just finished DOS 1 I'm very unhappy with the direction DOS 2 took in many ways.   As  a huge fan of the original DOS I find it bizarre how much the mechanics have changed. Combat isn't everything in this style of game but the changesa are so jarring I'm not sure I care to continue right now, and even if DOS 2 was the first I tried the combat system is just not much to my liking.  My biggest complaint is the weird Physical Armor and Magical Armor split. Unlike DOS 1 armor doesn't provide a flat % damage reduction and instead In DOS 2 everything has 3 Health bars, but before you can start chipping into the actual hit points of a target you have to eat through either Phyiscal or Magical armor with their respective damage types. This means having a split party of Mages and Fighters is really ineffecient as you'll be pushing through all three health pools instead of just two, doable yes, but way worse than just running 2 characters with the right skills and talents who focus on the same type of damage. There is no reward for party variety and in fact punishment for it.   Further the mechanics of both types of armor are even more of a hassle by blocking all status effects from taking effect until the armor pool broken. For example you can't stun someone with a shock spell until magical armor is depleted.  This includes, for some maddening reason, preventing any enemy who has an armor rating from being Taunted. So tanking isn't really much use. Speaking of tanking being not very useful, each enemy in the game will auto target your weaknesses and more often than not focus fire the lowest HP member of your party. You can actually learn to use this to your advantage but really it's just frustrating.   Also for vets of the first DOS the system has totally redone action points into a flat 4 per turn 6 points max, with only a few talents and spells modifying this at all. Not exactly a horrible change honestly but it doesn't feel ""right"" coming from the first game.   Honestly I'm going to take a break and play some other games and try to come back to DOS 2 with a more fresh perspective, but I'm still giving this a thumbs down for my own personal issues witht the combat system."

274,DevilFish,77,10,1,"September 30, 2017",Not Recommended,178.2,"Lots of people are talking about pros so I'ma share some cons.  This game will waste your time away, and by waste I mean WASTE. For starters you have to be save scum to the max. There are elements in the game that are insta-kill, and it will destroy you as simply as opening an unmarked door. Some battles will made you replay over and over and over and over again. Also if you don't invest in teleportation, you'll literally be dropped in a fiery pit with no means of getting out. Who knew? Or perhaps you'll enter a new area, be locked in a dialogue with no hope talking your way out, then being pulled into a fight and wiped out in the first turn (of course the enemy goes first...).   Long battles. Some people love the strategy in them. But as deep as the mechanics go, it gets pretty stale by your 100th tangle. What also gets stale is how long it takes for moves and attacks to animate out. If there are 10+ characters and an uneasy terrain, a fight can take well over 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and if you lose you'll have to redo it! (Unless you saved -midbattle).  Levelling system means in order to stay well equiped for adventure you'll need to spend about HALF OF YOUR TIME managing your inventory and buying/selling with merchants. You grow no attachment to your items, there is not a smug of aesthetic customization as most items both look the same and you can't see them until you put them on. Plus this isn't Skyrim so you can't just loot whatever exists in the game. Its more old school and loot is either randomly generated or placed.  A lack of seriousness. Sure there's a bounty of comedy in the game. But as far as I can tell you don't really get attached to any characters or their interests along the way. Sure there isn't a forceful light or dark path for you to take, rather its usually a I-Don't-Even-Care kind of path you end up on.  Level design is nothing new. Dragon Age has more memorable places and more interesting map corners.  Psychic enemies knowing your weaknesses. You'll literally need a mod in the workshop to make it a little more realistic and not computerized. Also you'll begin to realize that some battles have pre-programed movesets for the enemies, such as a marksman immediately teleporting to some far-reaching platform right away. This both makes fights really repetitive and also very procedural. PROCEDURAL.  Quests that don't Close. There's about a dozen or so quests that just won't Close properly. If you have OCD this game might just kill you. Plus the instructions are stylishly like a journal - in other words - often do not provide direct instructions. Think this makes it more immersive? NOT WHEN YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOUR CHARACTER EVEN MEANS IN HIS/HER OWN JOURNAL.  Soul-less characters. Revenge is a common option in the game. Most of the time its meaningless if the characters are described to be stoic and unhinged til oblivion.  90% of enemies know magic. 90% of enemies have ranged attacks. Even 'swordsman'. FYI.  Hotkeys that shift around even after you 'locked' them.  Confusing exterior-transitions. Usually to enter a building you have to click move into a space that isn't revealed yet (until you enter). How many times have I accidently 'stole' something as I'm trying to enter a building....  If you can overlook these gripes (and some others), then I'll recommend this game..."
275,Cassette,445,3,1,"October 8, 2017",Not Recommended,53.1,"I wish I could give the game a Maybe or Mixed rating. It's not a bad game per se, there's a lot to be enjoyed here: deep RPG mechanics, lots of roleplay, decent story and characters...  But the fun stops with the combat, while the core elements of it are very fun with all the tactics and elemetal madness going on, most of the time it just feels cheap, unfair, unbalaced and so on and on and on. Enemies always come in overwhelming numbers, with too much health and armor, they also happen to be omniscient and know all your weak spots, have more Action Points and sometimes they even ignore initiative/round order among others.  The difficulty is all over the place, in Classic mode (Normal difficulty) a single enemy a level above you can cause very serious damage to your party if you're not careful, if they're a single level below, it's a cakewalk. But if you do lower the difficulty to Explorer mode (Easy difficulty), then there's no challenge, it's so patronizingly easy that there's no fun. There's a real problem with stats bloat here.  The armor system is just stupid, all it does is add a second health bar that completely negates damage and status effects until depleted, afterwards it's useless, you can restore it, but it'll go down again soon enough. I really don't understand why they decided to make it this way.  And somehow I always felt underleveled to most situations even after completing all the quests I could get and trying not to stray away from the path too much, it just felt very unbalaced by the end of it all. And while I'm completely against it, you can't even grind levels in this game.   I can see people enjoying the combat, but to me it just didn't felt right, I didn't felt the diffilculty was because of my (lack of) skill, but because of bad design. I've played lots of CRPGs, including Original Sin 1, but this is the first time I ran into something like this. It's a shame, because I'm really enjoying my time with the game, just not the combat, the polar opposite of the first game, where I really loved the combat but not much the rest.  There's other little quirks with the game, but I don't think it's worth mentioning since the worst aspects are already here.  I would recommend the game if you have the patience to deal with the crazy difficulty or if you just don't care at all and don't mind playing a very, very stupidly easy RPG while on Explorer mode. But if you're like me, and don't like the concept of tying the difficulty to levels and stats or just didn't like the idea of anything written here, then there's better CRPGs out there for the likes of us."
276,irrelevant_elephant,94,3,1,February 7,Not Recommended,160.5,"If wondering why I spent so much time and still gave a thumbs down it's because I enjoyed it at first, but during Act 2 things went downhill. I would have quit except I had invested 120 hours at that point and I was still interested in the story.     PROS  + Presentation  The graphics are high quality for an isometric RPG with settings such as DOF, god-rays, shadowing, and other effects. Environments are stuffed full of assets, giving your eyes plenty to take in. Armors are probably the best I have ever seen containing lots of details and some especially foreign fashions. The soundtrack is an unusual combination of typical orchestra mixed in with exotic instruments; the result is a unique listening experience. The dialogue is entirely voice-acted making for a welcome addition. I did, however, noticed some inconsistency in the recording. Occasionally while talking to someone, it would suddenly sound like the actor/actress was too far away from the mic which was a bit jarring to hear. For the most part, the voice acting is excellent. Overall DOS 2 has a unique style and feels like a triple 'A' experience.   + Story  The premise is intriguing enough: Rivillon is in danger of being invaded, and the only hope is for someone to become the new Divine. You have the potential to achieve divinity, but so do your companions, and only one of you can ascend to godhood. If you decide to play as a premade character, then you'll have your own background story to play through. The main plot has some surprises which entice you to go on, and near the end, there are some crazy plot twists.   CONS  - Inconsistent Difficulty  The difficulty in this game varies way too much. Estimating how hard enemies are before a battle is less predictable than you would think. Factors such as quantity of enemies, what skills they have, and terrain significantly influence the outcome. I've had battles where I should have lost due to being out-leveled and out-numbered and yet still come out alive. On the other hand, I had enemies I couldn't defeat despite being a higher level and outnumbering them.   - Fragmented Exploration and Questing   When it comes to exploring and doing quests, you'll often get interrupted by difficulty spikes forcing you to leave and return once you've leveled up. Now, this is fine in moderation; many other games do this enforcing a sense of progression. The problem with DOS 2 is this sort of thing occurs persistently. It's frustrating to frequently start a quest, progress some ways into it, and then put it on hold while you grind other quests. These other quests also require you to stop part ways in and come back to later. The result is that you are always bouncing back and forth chipping away at things so that you can progress a little further.   It's like watching a marathon of movies, but instead of doing so in sequence, you do it in a scattered manner. Eventually, you will finish watching everything, but because there are constant interruptions, it's hard to get engaged with any one movie. In your attempt to complete what you have already started, the game thrusts several more quests for you to chip away. At one point, I had about twenty in my log. Having lots of quests to do is good, just not all at once; it gets overwhelming. It's not possible to avoid this from happening either because to progress you need to explore thoroughly, but in doing so, you unintentionally trigger more quests thus overloading your log.   A way to streamline gameplay is to decrease the difficulty, but unfortunately, this makes specific encounters underwhelmingly easy. So you can either have a fragmented adventure or have a cake walk. This quandary is all thanks to the wild variation in difficulty which I mentioned earlier.   Another thing which bothers me is the inability to go back to previous acts. I had a dilemma where I was getting tired of the Driftwood map and wanted to move on but still had unfinished quests. If the devs had allowed a return to areas, then I would have carried on with the game and come back after feeling more refreshed. Instead, I had to make an unnecessary choice between forcing myself to finish those quests there and then, or move on but forever lose the opportunity to do them.  - Flawed Combat  Initially, I enjoyed combat despite its short-comings, but as time went on, certain flaws grew more irritating. Combat lacks what I consider to be bare-bone essentials of turn-based gameplay. For starters, there is no cover mechanic which means melee characters will be out in the open exposed to ranged attacks. Also, you can't set overwatch (attack of opportunity) by yourself; it's automatic. Characters don't even get it by default; you have to earn the talent for it.   Another thing that hurts combat is the initiation system. In games like XCOM, turns get divided by teams. During your party's turn, you can use members in any order you'd like. You can also partially use a character's action points and then after issuing commands for other members, come back to use up the rest. Part of the fun and strategy of this setup is deciding what sequence of actions is optimal. In this game, however, there is no such thing; turns get divided amongst individuals. Who gets to act when during a round is determined by the initiation; the higher it is the sooner your members get to go. Performing sooner than an enemy is obviously beneficial since you can apply status effects (ex. stunned) or even kill before it gets the chance to act. That being said, having one of your members perform before another is not necessarily a good thing; here's an example.   There is a mage who is just about dead, and it's your turn. The character you are using at the moment is a melee build and doesn't have enough action points to reach and finish off the mage. You do however have an archer who could finish the job, except you have to wait until his turn. It just so happens that the mage gets to go before the archer and uses healing thus avoiding death. As a result of this, the battle goes on longer than it should have and in the end, you end up defeated. Perhaps this example is extreme, but it gets my point across; it's a rigid system which prevents you from using your members in a logical and strategic order. It's possible to delay a member's turn, but this isn't very helpful since you can't use it once any points get spent. Also, it puts that member at the very end of the round instead of swapping places with another team-mate. To summarize, the initiation system is inflexible and anti-strategy which goes against the whole idea of turn-based combat.   CONCLUSION  Despite people praising this game for its flexibility, it's ironically rigid which made me feel like I wasn't able to play the way I wanted to. I wish I my final impressions were better, but there were too many flaws. Ultimately, I give Divinity: Original Sin 2 a PAR of 1.  IMPORTANT: I use PARS instead of a standard 1-10 scale.

If you have read anything about it you will know that it's a solid old school RPG that is relatively unforgiving and certainly not noob friendly. That is part of why it's a good game. You don't get quest markers saying ""go here next"" or tons of help with how to build or equip your characters. You simply need to figure it out. That is a large part of what makes it a good game. There are literally tons and tons of successful ways to play the game (and almost as many ways to nerf yourself) which is a large part of the fun.   The game itself is great. The game is totally voice acted which makes for a nice touch in the modern age of voice-overed RPGs. The combat is very strategic and makes you think (unless you're on super easy mode). The quests are not gimmes and you need to think through what you're doing AND the sequence you do quests in. There are lots of ways to play the game which is probably the best thing about divinity 2 overall.  The bad: Bugs. Bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs and did i mention bugs? There are several essentially game breaking bugs that will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off to no end.  The first annoying bug is the ""half my team goes into combat bug"". You waltz into an area and bang, a fight starts. You take a quick glance at the top of your screen to see in which sequence you will get to take actions only to realize that 2 or sometimes even 3 of your 4 characters are not even involved. wtf? They're literally standing RIGHT NEXT to the character that is in combat and yet they're not considered active participants. Basically you have to load at your last save (which by the way, is the biggest advice for divinity 2, save often plus more often).  The other frustrating bug is that if you're playing on steam (who isn't?) you will get a launch error 1 out of 3 times. Basically you will get an error code that says the game executable file is corrupted in some way and you can't play. You can try verifying the integrity of the game cache and it works sometimes. Other times you simply have to delete everything and reinstall. Remember to go into your steam library files and set the game to launch in compatibility mode as an admin and this may reduce your errors to 1 in 4 launched. Nothing i have done however seems to get rid of this error.   Basically Larian made a great game but didn't take the time to fix some seriously game breaking errors. The game itself is fantastic but unfortunately it has a few massive gameplay faults in addition to some monstrous stability issues. I would wait another 3 - 6 months before picking this game up. Preferably, wait till it goes on sale because in it's current form it is not worth a purchase at full price."

Where it falls short are the many design issues that I genuinely can't distinguish from being bugs half the time, namely;  A quest log that doesn't record if a quest is finished half the time, making it impossible to tell if a questline is  finished or not.  Enemies that are ridiculously strong even on normal. Being forced to go down to the easiest difficulty due to  running out of ways to resurrect your party members is not a fun game mechanic.  A UI and map that are utterly useless, quests aren't marked on the map at all. I can understand that in a game where you are encouraged to figure things out for yourself, but you simply can't when the quest logs are bugged themselves. There's also no way to seperate 'junk' items automatically, having to manually click dozens of items to sell them isn't fun.   I really want to enjoy this game but I can't with these issues (the broken quests are by far the most annoying, one example being me being forced into a loop where I had to return to a character who had died, making the quest impossible to complete).   Has amazing promise but is far too aggravating to play seriously."

One level below your opponent makes for an almost impossible battle; one level above your oppenent removes any challenge. Still too many bugs regarding broken quests and character interactions.

The sound and look are great, the gameplay is fun and hard and the story is nice. All that being said I do not feel I can reccomend it because of the consistant bugs with many of the quests. This may seem like a minor thing, but for a game where a large portion of the experience you gain and many good items you can get come from closing a quest the fact that some quests just can not be completed if you accidently did part of it too early while exploring is detrimental. Two examples:  the quest ""The Purged Dragon"" becomes impossible to finish and close out if you have killed the shriekers in the abandoned camp before freeing Slane  or  the quest ""A Fate Worse Then Death"" being impossible to finish if you give Gratiana ""the soul jar with a name you do not recognize"" instead of her name because it gets rid of that jar and doesn't let you break it so the last necromancer jsut respawn without ever being able to end the quest , and those are only the ones that we have figured out the reason behind the quest bugging out.  ""The Burning Pigs"", ""The Tribe of Saheila"" and ""Signs of Resistance""  also are all unfinishable for me and some of my friends. It really ruins the experience since these bugged quests can not be dropped and started again and once you move from one act to nother all non-closed quests will just end with no reward given and you can not go back to previous acts so if they bug out like the first 2 quests I mentioned then you are just screwed or you have to go back possibly hours of saves to remotely try and fix it or completely start over. My hope is these quests will be fixed soon and if/when that happens the game will fully be 10/10."

HOWEVER, it’s buggy af. Worked perfectly fine until the second act, then it started getting extremely slow, lagged, choppy to the point of being unplayable. (Apperantly an issue with 4GB rams) So I started all over again, 48 hours of gameplay down the drain but I didn’t mind, it was so much fun to play this game that I actually enjoyed doing everything again, but this time bugs started coming up one after the other. I had to start 8 times over and I’m done, I can’t do this anymore. I cannot go back to that first level one more time. I’ll wait until the next patch to even think about playing again. So consider this before buying.  Another complaint would be the difficulty level. Playing in explorer mode is so easy that there’d be times one character in my group would be able to finish the fight. There’s not much of a challenge and you can pretty much kill every single foe at first try. The classic mode however is so hard that you’ll go through resurrection scrolls like healing potions. There’s no middle ground!  So to sum up, a big middle finger to Larian for coming up with the best game I’ve ever seen and not letting me play it, and not getting back to any e-mails."

303,IronSnak3,343,5,0,"October 16, 2017",Not Recommended,52.9,"Very disappointed with this one. Worse than the first in almost every way. Larian basically took a solid turn-based RPG and made it into a JRPG.  The combat system is broken thanks to the new armor system, which makes characters immune to effects until the armor is completely worn down. This makes battles less fun and less tactical, as the only thing you can do in the first few rounds is chip away at armor.  The AP system has changed as well, instead of the 10-20 APs in the first game now there's only 4-6. The final version also saw some adjustments to abilities and AP costs - while the early access offered some variety (e.g. magic touch attacks compensating for limited range with low AP cost), now almost everything costs 2 AP.  So it's three actions per round and that's basically it, no matter what those actions are. Stats no longer affect the availability of action points, so those super-agile characters will move just as fast the lowliest brutes.  It's nearly impossible to win a fight the first time you attempt it without cheesing it one way or another. But the devs admitted they left the exploits in specifically so players would use them. Yeah, no thanks. Keeping a conversation going while everything around is burning to hell and back is just plain stupid.  Characters and their presentation are so cliched, it's like a 5 year old came up with them. Save for the undead companion, there's no originality whatsoever, nothing you haven't seen before anywhere you look. Walk up to a possible companion to say hi and oh look, you're railroaded into having a knife to your throat in the friggin' dialogue because the character you're talking to is supposed to be badass or something and the only way you can get out is by the equivalent of peeing yourself while reciting bad poetry.  The first D:OS had a lot of cliches, sure, but it thrived on them because it acknowledged them as silly and they became light-hearted fun. This one tries to take itself too seriously and falls flat.  The story is boring. I stopped caring as soon as I left the Fort. Immersion is completely gone. It's what happens when you pair a completely over-the-top combat system with what's supposed to be a serious storyline (yet is so mind-numblingly shallow). They just don't work well together. I can't get invested into the world and the woes of the characters when the next minute I'm fighting boulder-slinging crocs.  Dialogue, while it uses the dialogue interface, is roughly 50% (or what feels like 50%) the narrator intervening with some useless description of what a character is doing, or looks like. The 5 year olds that wrote the script definitely never heard of 'Show, don't tell'.  GM mode had a lot of promise, but it's basically just a limited create-your-own-adventure mode. I was hoping for more control over the main campaign; having something to start from rather than building from scratch wouldn't have been as tedious. The very few assets provided are just that - very few.  Quests are plentiful, but very improperly paced. You'll basically have tens of quests cluttering up the journal before you have a chance to complete one of them. Some quests and encounters are timed, meaning that the NPCs involved either die or move on before you have a chance to interact with them, missing out on precious xp that you have no other way of getting. Because there's no options to grind some xp, even a little, you're forced to minmax and metagame as much as possible to the point where it becomes a chore.  Also on quests, it seems like the game is designed to be played with one character only. Get a quest from an NPC and you can usually progress it only with the same character that initially spoke to the NPC if the quest involves speaking with the same NPC at some point, as having another companion do the talking will get regular greetings as if it's the first time you met the NPC.  Inventory and item management is carried over from the first game and suffers from the same problems. It's tedious, clunky, slow, and frustrating, especially with no way to tell which items you'll need for quests later on and which you can safely lose. If anything, D:OS2 has more items laying about, which wouldn't be a bad thing at all if it didn't mean you have to spend hours just managing your inventory.  The trait system from the first game is gone, replaced by tags. Sure, you can gain a couple of said tags through regular gampley, but it's nowhere as dynamic and rewarding as in D:OS. Tags are now mostly just an extra dialogue option that rarely gives better results than the default ones.  On the upside, the game does look good, equipment is more varied than in its predecessor, the levels are fun to explore, with many secrets and hard-to-spot areas laying about. Combat is fun, only nowhere near as fun as it was in the first game, and there's actually less of it this time around. Having multiple races to play with is definitely interesting, though the elves' corpse eating ability is squandered on meaningless dialogue - while at first it seems like great attention to detail, you'll quickly tire of the endless vague descriptions of past lives of unnamed, irrelevant NPCs. Yeah, I'm so disappointed by this title that even when trying to think of positives I end up discussing the negative aspects of the same mechanic I was trying to praise.  Save your $$$, wait for a sale."
304,c_bus87,17,6,1,September 10,Not Recommended,57.0,"I might be one of the few who genuinely does not like this game. Here's why:  1) I feel like there are 'gotcha' moments in dialogue. Someone asks a question and you are given a few responses. One of them progresses the quest, the other two end it because the person gets mad at you or something. There is no way of knowing which one is correct (by investigation, getting to know the person, etc.) or by coming back later. I can hear the devs going ""Haha you picked the wrong answer!!!"" Not clever, just irritatig.   ""Hey, do you like a, b, or c?""  ""I like a.""  ""You idiot! Now I don't like you forever!!"" -- a regular conversation, apparently.  2) An over-reliance on terrain types in combat. Terrain types should be an accent to a strong combat system, but this feels like boring fighting on changing terrains. It makes combat feel like a weird board game a opposed to a real tactical experience. I would rather see an emphasis on flanking, cover, team work, and skills. There are many battles that simply cannot be won without manipulating terrain type.  3) The game lacks immersion. I'm not sure I ever cared about the quest or main mission. The world doesn't feel lived in. There are to many jokes that rip you from the seriousness of the situation. The tone is chicken jokes, not end of the world or serious danger. Additionally, once an area is clear its clear for good.  If I remove a gang in the prison, is it likely that no one will fill the power vacuum? No more prisoners will come in? The world feels empty and unresponsive.  4) Growth happens slowly at first, but then very rapidly. I don't feel like I've earned a lot of my attribute points. The way areas are leveled also makes the game feel very linear, and, again, once an area is clear it's typically clear for good. No random encounters, which might make leveling up to face a tough enemy more rewarding.  "

306,lowenklee,41,6,1,August 16,Not Recommended,109.6,"As a quick matter of background info, these days I generally enjoy more action type RPGs, but I’m no stranger to the old school CRPG genre. That said, and as regards the D:OS series …   I didn't enjoy the first game's story, world space/mythos, or light-hearted touch ...but the combat mechanics were rock-solid and highly compelling. On the recommendation that the narrative and thematic elements had been improved while maintaining the original's strong combat mechanics I decided to give the sequel a go.  At about 50 hours invested, it's awful and surprisingly dull:  ~Mediocre and generic storytelling (admittedly better than most games but certainly nothing to get excited over).  ~Combat encounters all feel the same (i.e. jarringly arbitrary and ridiculous ...that everything reduces to fire and teleporting regardless of enemy type is only slight hyperbole).  ~The new armor system adds nothing but tedium.  ~There's a quest tracker that may as well have been completely omitted (not asking for hand-holding or map markers, but how about at least capturing the salient details after receiving hints/tips in dialogue on a consistent basis?)   ~And finally there's the unforgivably antiquated UI/Inventory truly worthy of nothing but scorn.  Much has been made of the game's difficulty, but difficulty is manageable (simply turn it down, prepare better, or learn better tactics); what isn't manageable are bad game mechanics, even when presented in a pretty wrapper.   Perhaps the GM mode and the co-op are the game's redeeming features. If so, fair enough. But, for my money as a single-player gamer, the game can certainly be fun with some considerable effort invested ignoring its shortcomings. But is it worth the trouble? Not particularly.

But I can only give a thumbs up and a thumbs down. So with that I guess I can only say that I can only give it based off what the average consumer can expect.  First off this game is linear, in other words, it seems like you can do whatever you want but you actually can't because you need to be a high enough level to do so in the first place forcing you to do quests and tasks in a specific order.  Then there are more issues such as some serious design flaws. The armor system (for example) is one of them. Because of how it works you can't really used a mixed party. You either go all in for physical or all in for magical damage. To make matters worse as long as the enemy has physical armor you can't cc them which is a serious design flaw.  Then it kinda gets a bit worse when we talk about how you have to cheese everything and chain cc to win or how enemies can cc chain you into oblivion. This is why you use a diminishing returns system, ie. the more you use something the less effective it is.  The story is honestly kind of meh but it does have it's ups and downs. Personally I don't have any complaints about it.  Honestly, the game doesn't have that many issues IMO, but the issues are so bad that it seriously tanks the rating that I would give this game from an 8.5-9 out of 10 to around a 7.7-7.8.  With that being said, if you are just some random gamer just looking to pick up and RPG then this game seriously is not for you. This game was aimed at more hardcore RPG fans which is why I have to give this game a thumbs down even if I want to give it a mixed opinion because for the average person this game probably isn't going to be worth it. That's not to say that this is a bad game because it's not bad in the slightest, it's just not good enough for the average person to pick it up and enjoy it.  I suggest that you watch a stream, gameplay review, or a let's play before buying this game because this is not like the first in the series either. So keep that in mind when you decide to buy this game. I  also put the game on the second hardest difficulty and was pretty much being forced to cheese my way through most fights which was very frustrating. It gets kinda better as you get good gear and stats but early on it's extremely difficult so keep that in mind as well if you are new to RPGs that you should not be cranking up the difficulty."

310,NanoByteGhost,354,7,0,"October 5, 2017",Not Recommended,111.9,"I have now finished this game and have rewriten this review.   I have included some tips to help you finish this game if you really want to buy it. There are some things the game just throws at you suddenly that will end your game if your not prepared.   They labeled this game an RPG when in reality its more of a squad combat game with upgrades. Focus on that and you will understand the game better.    Role Play options are very limited. The game really does not have much support for geninue role play and the support that does exist, really does not do much. It is all about earning experience to upgrade your characters for the next fight.   The characters background stories are weak and uninteresting, the main plot never really grabbed me.   I got the impression the game was designed before the story and they wrote the story to try and encompose all the fights the game designers had created.   There are for example nearly a dozen bad guys, not of which have any explainable link to each other during the game but get thrown together right at the end without any real explanation.   Many players who have finished the game consider the ending to be a disappointment and honestly, if your expecting a good story, your going to find it disappointing too.   Its a squad based combat game, plain and simple.   With that in mind, this is the core gameplay.   You fight, you earn experience points which eventually leads to you leveling up. At that time you get awarded points that can be spent improving your character.   I found it useful not to spend all these points right away due to the games ""One way to do some stuff"" problem.   Each area you explore is filled with bad guys which you have to kill, once dead they do not respawn. The experience you earned killing them is the only experience your going to get from them. So make the most of it.   If you can get 1 level higher than the bad guys your fighting, then the game is much easier, if your equal or even lower in level than the guys your fighting, its very hard.   What characters you choose for your party may appear to be a free choice on your part but its not. That is an illusion because this game needs you to have certain things in your party to stop you either dying a lot or just not being able to process past some quests.   Without a Mage in your party for example every single fight is like a BOSS fight.   Makes are like EASY MODE on Hard difficulty. Explorer difficulty is what most games would call ""Very hard"" difficulty.   With a mage in your party things get slightly easier and you manage to avoid most of the games bad habits.  The developers favourite trick is putting you up against impossible odds that you cannot win without playing the system, eg abusing fast travel to heal, reloading saved games when a spell does not work as intended, so you can try again.   There are no easy fights in this game, in fact most fights are extraordinarily hard.   Especially if you do not have a mage in your party.   AIs at your level typically (not always) have twice as much health, twice as much armour and twice as much magic armour than you. They also seem to have far better spells to cast at you.   Source which is used to power the most powerful spells, just seems to be sucked out of you and used to power the AIs most powerful spells. So having any source on you, is like giving the AI ammo to shoot you with.   So imagine what an insane idea it would be if you had unlimited source for spells.... That would seriously suck when the AI pretty much uses your own source to kill your entire party over and over again.   Thats not rhetorical btw....  Stun, freeze, charm and shock are all spells that cause you to miss a turn, you will spend most of your game watching your characters being slowly killed without you ever getting a turn because of these. A mage helps defend against these but they still happen and are far too common in this game.  It makes fights boring.  Some people consider Teleport to be optional, but there are many locations in this game where you simply cannot proceed without it.  Blood rain or any pool of blood is also needed at one point so if your a solo character without blood rain, you game will end pretty abruptly.  Also developing your characters relationships in game is important because if they are not best buddies, you will lose some of them at a certain point in the game and that party you worked so hard on for 3 acts, will just no longer exist and it happen without fight or any choice on your party.   The game makes the same mistake Divinity 1, Pillars and Wasteland all made, they make every battle very very hard unless you stumble across the right party combination and spell combination, then the game becomes easier.  RPGs of old scaled well with difficulty, this game does not, its 24/7 hard hard hard.    If you want to try something different, you will probably find the game kicks your♥♥♥♥♥ at several points and stops you progressing. Though this game is less prone to that than Divinity 1 was.  Puzzles tend to be vague and badly explained, you really have to second guess the devs intentions a lot in this game. A sign of bad game design.  At certain points you have epic battles with an areas main boss, given most fights feel like boss fights, you can imagine how much harder these guys are.   So imagine reaching a point in the game, worked around all the bugs, learned the system so the game would not just end suddenly on you. Only to find your self facing every frigging bad guy you previously killed later on, not 1 at a time but all at once and this time they are level 20.   That is not rhetorical either....  You will be left with the impression the devs didnt want anybody seeing the end game which tends to reveal the games story is very very adhock nature.   If you still want to buy this game I suggest you take at least 1 mage in your party, this makes the game much easier. I also suggest you take the teleport spell, the blood rain spell and learn to use the Pyramid fast travel and map fast travel to send characters out of combat to heal during the worst fights because you will need that advantage.   You need the learn the system to beat this game, between the insane difficulty and bugs you cannot finish it without knowing how it all works or how to abuse that system.   I am sure their are cheats, god mode or what ever available but I dont know them, so I played the game as is and I can tell you without specialist knowledge, this game will last you about 110 hours first time around.   Finally save often and make it a new save, do not over write other saves because you will find you have to go back quite far some times to work around game bugs or that sudden case of ""cannot progress without something"" problem that this game has.    So, is it a good game ?  It is squad combat is good game but the battles are stupidly hard most of the time, so you end up getting more frustrated with the game than anything.   The original Divinity Original Sin was only finished by 6% of players according to steams stats during its first 2 years. The Directors cut/Enhanced version was slightly easier but still very hard.   Divinity 2 is a lot like that, most of you will never get to the end of it.  I found this game to be more frustrating then fun, it wears you do until you lose all interest in playing it. That is how most of your games will end.   I only finished it because it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off and I was not going to be beaten by a badly balanced game.  I think the game engine is good, the ideas in the game are good but the gameplay difficulty is stupidly hard with clearly unbalanced features common place.   Especially in combat when an AI mage hits you with 1 spell and destroys your magic armour in one go, then hits you with another spell and just kills you out right.   That happens a lot so take a lot of resurrection scrolls.   I cannot recommend this game unless you love that feeling of frustration."

However my sole reason for writting this review in the first place. Is that due to some unforeseen error. (that i can only assume is either divine intervention or just the worst luck possible) Your camera can lock perminantly into darkness. Note this is only if you having a super fun time with your perma-death difficulty enabled characters in split-screen mode. (it's rumoured to be whenever your playing split screen mode you run a risk of this, it has only happened twice so far to be fair however the entirety of your save file is thereforth unplayable).   So as I was saying(ranting, excuse the emotional nature of my review, me and my freind have just lost all progress of a finely tuned epic playthrough due to an error we can't fix no matter what we've tried.) So to contuine forth in our playing of the game would be to admit we don't care for the 40+ hours that it has taken us to get to this point.   You will most likely enjoy this game if you have ever played a turn based game prior or enjoy Dungeons and Dragons. However let me reiterate the reason I am not reccomending it, is due to the sheer heart break that may be fall you if you happen to become prey to the same bug.   (which I'm more than 100% certain is simply the camera deciding it wants to go subteranian and never reapear again)  To summerise     -Great Game    -Not worth the time  "

I LOVE THE FIRST GAME AND I LOVE THIS GAMES WORLD. but honestly this game just feels like its punishing you for playing it. unless you want to take in every detail and take 10 minues deciding every move the first game is much much better. easy is like dumb as hell. and classic is a grulling struggle to stay alive. honestly yuou hit level 10 and the game just stops being fun. basically play a team that does one dmg type either physical or magical or struggle almost every big fight.  as a big fan of this game, i find it super annoying to se such an amazing expirence lose its self trying to be this hard game. if you can make an actually hard game do it, but making a game with bloated enemy stats late game and encounters literally designed to kill you until you figure out the ""gimmick"" (i dont use that word lightly) to win. this results in a rinse and repeat strats that kill any immersion the steller setting this game gives you. for a game that lets you do anything in many senerios, the fact that leveling kills your exploration, and guides you through thte game in a basically linear path is pretty sad and goes to show the developers had ""this need to be hard because ppl like the hard stuff"" in mind which goes so against how the rest of the game feels.  like i play games when im high and trying to relax, i like a challange, not getting but ♥♥♥♥ed for making the wrong action selection because i didnt pay attention to the five minutes it was the enemies turn....... for anyone whos played  it the oil to fire voidling fight is  a  good example of my point. unless you know whats going to happen in that fight you will die even on easy mod.  thats not fun, thats lame game design."

The quote-on-quote moral choices you make don't seem impactful at all when this narrative is driven forward no matter what. The dialogue, which is besides the combat the bread and butter of the game, gets extremely preachy and tiresome very quickly.

You are always out numbered at the start and it seems every encounter has atleast one or more npcs which either summon adds, or the game just cheats and throws more adds in as the battle progresses. 2. NPCs played by the same rules as the characters.  an NPC the same level as your character will always have more HP, will always have more Regular Armor and more Magic Armor (these are two seperate things in this game) will always have more skills and more resists and this is at the easiest setting.  Also NPCs can cheat and shoot arrows and cast spells through things that block your attacks. Like wise human like NPCs seem to have infinite special ammo (like fire arrows and poison bombs) and Monstrous NPCs constantly spam their AOE/status altering attacks. 3. Every battle ground is staged against you.  The enemy always has the high ground for ranged attacks, requiring you to navigate 2 or 3 turns to get on even footing and away from the preplaced barrels of fun that get exploded for your enjoyment er uhm death.  All the while your enemies, enjoying all this carefully placed stuff are wearing you down and spamming the entire battle field with fire / ice / poison etc.. 4. Even if you are the kind of person who enjoys reloading and trying the same battle over 10 times or more to figure out how to beat any particular fight, you will still be upset when the game crashes while your doing one of those reloads, or the save you have been reloading over and over again gets corrupted and cant be loaded, Or you finally win the fight only to discover that one of those negative status effects that got applied during the battle, never comes off afterwards, oh and the quest that was supposed to be updated / completed doesnt get updated or completed either.  All that said, there is a real diamond in the rough here.  Graphics are amazing, Music / sound is nice (i havnt been tempted to turn it off yet,) and what little i have been able to see of the quests / roleplaying part of the game has left me wanting more and more (which makes me ever more frustrated with all the above that keeps me from persuing the actual game.)

329,johnqwilson,60,2,0,August 4,Not Recommended,123.3,"I really wanted to like this game. I love Divinity: Original Sin--the original. Not the Enhanced Edition, but the original was 10/10 for me.And I do grant that D:OS 2 is beautiful, has a very wide variety of interesting skills, great skill combination possibilities, and it is obvious this was a massive effort to put together.  But.   There are four problems I have with this game:  1 is the lack of crafting. In D:OS original, most of my end crafted equipment was superior to any dropped item. My craftworks didn't have all of the properties of top drops, but for what I wanted to do, my crafted equipment fit my strategy. Life was good. In D:OS 2, crafting is useless. Why bother stockpiling loot? Crafting is one of the joys of any D&D Style game, and it is sorely missing here.  2 is that combat is boring. D:OS 2 suffers from the same problem as Dragon Age II. The only way to get through toughest tier combat is to play each battle multiple times, memorize the spots where enemies spawn, and position in advance accordingly. Or, watch a video that shows spawn points and positional tactics for that battle. This is a horrible approach to combat. D:OS original had some very tough fights that required real strategy to survive. D:OS 2 requires no strategy, just watch a video for each fight, position as the video does, use the same spells, and the fight becomes almost too easy.   3 is the insane power spike of each level. A level 16 fight is impossible for a level 15 party, and piece of cake for a level 17 party. This makes the game too linear, with little freedom to explore, and the only real way to tell the right order to do things is...watch walkthrough videos! In D:OS original, I rather liked having my lvl 6 party take on lvl 8 char-boned archers. In D:OS 2, this is not possible. Your level provides huge differences in base stats, the stats of any equipment you buy, etc. It's too much.  4 is the lack of any engaging story. D:OS 2's story feels like an afterthought. In D:OS original, there was real character development, truly original twists and turns, and I was left with an inspired fantasy of something that felt like it could have really happened. D:OS original had a Silmarillion-esque quality about it, or the AD&D descriptions of the nine hells and seven heavens. D:OS was interesting reading/watching on its own right, to really contemplate an alternate theory of cosmology and the universe. D:OS 2 tries to copy the same story pattern, but there's nothing really interesting about it. D:OS 2's story ""reads"" like a typical Choose Your Own Adventure book.   So...there you go. I almost feel bad, because a lot of people put a lot of time into this. But most of what made the first game special, is missing in this. Spell combinations is probably the most interesting thing about D:OS 2, and it really is impressive. But for me, that's not enough."

Played with 3 of my friends, from the beginning, restarted a litany of times in order to play as different characters, and finally beat it today. And wow, was it a bad journey.  Don't get me wrong; The multiplayer aspect was fun. Working with my friends tactically to take down enemies and out manuveur them was insane, but the joy was constantly sucked out by the many choices you could make to ""break"" this game. The freedom of choice is phenomenal and will draw plenty to it, but compared to other CRPGs of the time, the story was broken (quite literally at times, with our group not even finishing Sebille or Fanes backstories; My own, playing the Red Prince, seemed to get stuck at the end though it seemed to be finished), the action was often split and far between long sections of players do whatever they want and exploring, and there was a fair amount of time where I didn't experience the story at all because other players went left when I decided to go right.  Now most of what I mentioned as problems were intended to be features of the game. Carve your own path in a multiplayer in which everyone can participate on different sides of the same story; Do what you want when you want, and solve problems in unique ways. This prospect was the same thing that I loved playing Divinity OS 1 with my brother a while back. And you can find aspects of this game that mirror those exact design goals. But Divinity OS 1 handled this with a voting system that at least made sense, and the chaos of four players with different mind sets often doing what they want, that you could miss out if everyone isn't tied to each other as they advance forward, and the fact you could completely end another person's gaming experience by doing what you want in a quest and ruin what they intended to do ruined this game for me.  This entire review could be taken as the a twisted view on the positives of what this game has to offer, but honestly, I have a hard time imagining a group of friends / gamers playing the game without ruining it by devolving it into a race to see who gets to experience the game first.  If you are looking for a fun tactical romp through the Divinity universe, look no further. If you are looking for a unique multiplayer RPG that takes your choices into consideration and provides a wonderfully in depth RPG system, get ready to fight your friends and watch what little your teamwork means in a game that forces you to fight against each other to decide the end."

The developers have no interest in actually moderating and things are being tossed around in the forums that would get you perma-baned in other forums, let alone a soft ban... How is it supposed to work? A) Someone posts suggestion B) People agree or disagree civil like, possibly being a simple as +1 or -1. What shouldn't happen? Fan boi's rush into any thread critical of any aspect of the game and proceed to destroy not only the suggestion, but more specifically the person giving the suggestion (AKA Alinsky rules for radicals, ad hominem, ect) People have been reported multiple times and nothing has been done.

They have a road map and are doing what they set out to do, nothing more nothing less. If you are buying into the Early Access you are purely playing as a ""bug finder"" in which case Larian should be paying the players, not the other way around...   A2. DOS:EE was one step forward two steps back and three to the side of DOS: Original and DOS2 is following the same path. If you loved DOS you might like DOS:EE and you could possibly even like DOS2- but are the games similiar enough to support purely because of this now? No. The game is changing at a rate that frankly you don't know what you will have at release and supporting the game purely from a franchise view point is beyond risky.   Bottom line is that if you are in group one don't waste your time and money. If you are in group 2 don't take the risk (you can only play act 1 which is only 10-20 hours) and wait until the game is fully released and it is clearer.  EDIT: Once again in another EA game people are reviewing a game based on what they ""hope"" the game will be and not what the game is currently, while ignoring the community and input-giving aspects entirely... Those are literally the only reasons (as I point out above) why you would support a game in Early Access and currently the game is not worth risking an EA buy in- wait until the game comes out and read some reviews at that point in time and make your choice then."

Really do not like how many of them there are. 4) Complexity. Classic mode is not what it was from previous game, it's much harder. When switching to Traveler/Explorer mode it's very easy. So there is no suitable mode for me which really upsets me. 5) Bug: Sebilla's equipment inventory doesn't get shared items from common inventory after some time in game. 6) Have a feeling that sometimes enemies can shoot precisely through the edges of the wall/obstacle while I cannot because I am just a human. It's because AI can calculate exactly the exact place where to stand to shoot. I think that developers need to make enemies behave more like humans in this concern. 7) Frustrating diary logs. Too many records in the diary can be highlighted after some event occurs which is not good. 8) Battlefield becomes hardly visible if fire, smoke, poison are present. Especially - fire. I see that fire effects were greatly improved graphically but battlefield becomes hardly visible after all these effects. 9) Voices of NPCs are good but I have a feeling that compared to previous game they are not so distinct/clear. It's especially important for me as I am not native English speaker although I do understand English if person's voice is clear/distinct. 10) Waypoint. Why not making Waypoints links directly on the map? And why putting Waypoints menu to the main menu game? It was even better positioned in Original Sin 1.

If the fight has your party outnumbered, your health pool will not be sufficient to handle the focus fire that comes with the CC, and you will lose party members. Lose party members, and it is not likely that you can revive them successfully without repeating the cycle. It is possible to play with a solo talent that gives more actions and armor. This makes the game much more balanced early on if not too easy. In reflection, I feel that the experience to level is simply too steep and that if the levels would come quicker everything would be much more balanced. Around level 10-12 armor gets MUCH more powerful and the game seems like it balances back out before it gets easy end game.   The real issue I have with the game though is that in order to make your character powerful you MUST focus your attributes and skills sufficiently. If the attributes were slightly less dominant, then it might be possible to build a more broad character and enjoy the resulting flexibility. In the end, this was simply extremely difficult to do, and the balance issues noted caused me to stop playing. Too a long time messing with various character configurations before that point though."

This game was released absolutely broken however.  Do not spend money on it now if you aren't a diehard divinity fan, it will frustrate you with all the broken quests, broken mechanics, spelling errors, and story glitches.  Most, yes most quests are bugged in one way or another, and trying to complete them in the not perfect order, or heck even talking with the wrong party member, will break the quest and it'll never be able to be finished.  For an rpg, that is unexcusable.  Simply put, wait for a month or two, they need to essentially come out with 2-3 more major patches to fix the game.  It'll be great someday, for now its just frustrating."
349,Homongoloid,579,6,1,"September 29, 2017",Not Recommended,115.6,"I can't recommend this game in it's current state. It's currently so imbalanced and glitchy that I can't even properly enjoy it, it just frustrates me. If horrible bugs and horrible balance don't ruin the experience for you, and you're fine with the game feeling pretty indie (Conversations are entirely dialogue, for example, and actions are always narrated without ever even slightly matching what the models are actually doing) then it's a great game, and you should buy it on sale. But if you're picky, or annoyable, then I'd wait for them to fix these issues.. If they ever do, they were brought up before the game was released and they did nothing about them. I'd recommend the first game if you're going to get either, which has it's share of issues but not as many as this game.  If you want some very detailed information on this game, read this thread. It's very informative and goes quite in-depth to the balance issues of the game, but doesn't really talk about the glitches:  http://larian.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=621419&#Post621419  The thread summarized is how forcing enemies to go every other turn prevents strategy and can make killing enemies detrimental, the AI is both smart enough to be psychic to know everything about everyone while also stupid enough to walk away from you to hurt themself before turning around to hit you with an attack they were in range for the whole time, the new armour system hurts team compositions that aren't entirely physical (and preferably 2 lone wolves), the old defensive abilities were deleted in place of this new and bad armour system, there are tons of useless things that you should never level up / obtain, the butchering of the attributes and slaughtering of any depth or complexity, how initiative is completely useless, and a few other things.  What that thread doesn't talk about, however, is the bugs. The horrible bugs that are everywhere. Moving might sometimes take 1 more AP than it said it did, ruining your turn. Moving might hit you with an attack of opportunity, even though it didn't show the indicator that it would and you were hugging the enemy. Moving might make your party members run off in separate, random directions and engage combat. Moving through anything that is detrimental is incredibly annoying, since the pathfinder will do it's best to force you to not step into anything hazardous for even a millisecond (even though stepping in it does basically nothing), yet will have your followers loiter in shrieker death-zones for an hour until they die. Clicking on yourself to buff yourself, when you are clearly on the middle of your character, might target a corpse behind you and give the dead enemy armour instead. Clicking an enemy to attack them a second time will instead make you move if you clicked just slightly too quickly. Dialogue will sometimes not happen at all, skipping an entire part of the conversation leaving you confused, and when it does happen it may or may not have even half of what was said. Dialogue automatically starting and being unjoinable for party members, so only one person can enjoy it. Or how vital NPCs may not spawn, triggers may not happen, and your dialogue choices won't register so you keep repeating the conversations repeatedly.  Even without counting how annoying all of the bugs are, the game's balance is still undesirable at best. You're given 4 Action Points per turn, which is what you use to do your actions, and it has a cap of 6, meaning you reach the full extent of what you can do in one turn in 1.5 turns. In the first game you had 7 max AP and every point of Constitution you levelled up, you would get one more AP. This let you actually do more things than just punch someone twice, or walk a little close then punch them once. In the first game, you could actually allocate your stats to what you think would be best. There were defensive things, offensive things, spell things, a bunch of stuff. In this, it's basically +5% damage or putting it into a spell school so you're better at casting that kind of spell. You can't increase your baby-sized AP unless you halve your party size, you can't get abilities to resist CC since the armour removes any anticipation and just makes everything ""Definitely"" or ""Definitely not"", you can't do anything about how you build your character other than ""Slightly stronger"" or ""Can now also get this school of magic"".  There's a mod to give you 8 max AP, but mods disable achievements. There's a mod to halve armour and add it to VIT so that mixed teams can work, and crowd controls ever see any use. But mods disable achievements. There's a mod that lowers the cooldown of mage spells since mages are severely underpowered... but mods disable achievements. There's a mod that makes it so that things don't just constantly get spammed onto your hotbar, filling up any open slot there is even if it's before the end of the hotbar, making the hotbar the most disorganized thing in existence that requires constant upkeep to make it not horribly ugly, but mods disable achievements. There's mods to slow down levelling, or lower the huge difference between levels because currently you have to swap out gear every level because of the giant bloat between levels, but mods disable achievements.  I know I'm forgetting at least half of what I want to write about, so I'll probably update this review later. If they fix enough of these issues I'll change the review from negative to positive."

359,C Swords,189,6,1,"September 23, 2017",Not Recommended,15.4,"Let me start with this game is beautiful with some amazing music and a great story. There are many things about this game I do love, and I think the developers have done a fantastic job on the it.   I however cannot give it a thumbs up for a few reasons though, and can I add that this review is purely subjective to me.   Firstly, and mainly, this isn't the type of game you can stick on and play without reserving time out of your day. You need to spend actual effort into playing it, and what I mean by that is that the game gives you vague clues on where you need to go and what you need to do. Most quests are cryptic puzzles you need to solve by yourself. I currently do not have time in my life to put on my Sherlock hat due to having a 2 year old who takes my day up, and on a night I like to play something that I can play spending only 50% of brain power on. Now this you could argue that I am clearly not intelligent enough to play the game, and to that I wouldn't argue with you.  The game is advertised that decisions you make effect all aspects of the game. Well, I dispute this fact in it's entirety. When you are in the prison island, there is a local gangster who aparently controls food supply and has thugs etc. Well, I killed him. Not a single thing changed from this, the only thing I noticed was that I couldn't trade with him or his dead corpse anymore. Now once again, you can argue with this fact, as if you look at it closely, the gameplay was infact altered forever as I have lost access to a trader. If that is the case, then bah! He only sold a couple items that to me were of no use, and this is a trivial change to the game.  Source points, oh source points. I would have assumed that once I lost the collar, I would have been able to naturally cast spells. Nope, you have to find these source points, and once you have some, they are one time use. They do not regen over time and that was not what I was expecting. Now this complaint I can understand is only something that could bother me, but after all the effort I went through to find some, I would have hoped for them to be more useful.  With regards to skill points/character points etc, you do get plenty, that's not an issue, the issue I have is not knowing what would be useful. For instance, there is a crypt, the same place I found my first source points, and in there, there are some tombstones you can move. The thing is you need a character with a higher strength level than what you start with. This all sounds logical so far, but here is the issue. The game doesn't tell you that you need strength to open it, you have to make the assumption yourself, and even when you do, it gives no clue on how many points in strength you do need for it. Now I could have missed something here, but given my 50% brain allocation, I couldn't see anything that suggests otherwise.  That is my essay review on Divinity OS2, and why for me it isn't a breath taking game. It is in many ways fantastic, brilliant and genius, but in many other ways, for me, and yes that's a personal opinion, this isn't the best."

379,Clown Baby,304,4,1,May 18,Not Recommended,27.9,"Sorry guys, I don't see why this game is so well loved or recieved.  The balance is horrible. Magic is pretty much worthless, except necromancy, which takes the entire game and runs it over. Play melee, bows (which do the exact same thing as magic), and necromancy or die. Don't like it? That sucks. It's not like it's impossible with other builds, but you will have a frustrating time, I promise you. You WILL find fights that you're not allowed to escape from that WILL kill you, completely randomly, which is where resurrection scrolls come in, and they get their own section later.  The story is well written, but horribly paced. Prepare for loooong swathes of gameplay with very little story actually going on, as you jump from sidequest to sidequest, using an interface that was apparently designed by a man with his head stuck in a filing cabinet. After 20 hours, I really just found myself not caring about the overarching plot. I kind of liked my party members, but their sidequests take just as long to get going as everything else. It's a lot of ""I think we'll find this guy is Crapville"", but Crapville is three acts and 30 hours away.  But by far the worst design decision are the resurrection scrolls. This game kind of has perma-death, but not really. Rather than killing a character and making you get a new one, your character dies, becomes locked in your party, and this ghost...soul thing hovers in place until you can bring them back with a scroll. Don't have one? That sucks, go craft one. The things to craft them are totally random drops? Oh, then you're up a creek without a paddle, my friend. You cannot dismiss a dead party member to replace them, and you can't do anything about them if you can't get a scroll. This means that, best case scenario, if you don't have a scroll, prepare to go walk to town, talk to everyone to buy one, then walk allllll the way back.   Why not just have a priest in town to bring your character back for the same cost as the scroll? If you want to punish me for messing up, that's fine, good on you, but this can render the game unwinnable, especially if your healer goes down and you can't pick them back up. A game mechanic that encourages me to savescum over and over again until I either get RNGesus to not kill my squishy mage before I can move or quit is NOT good game design. It's frustrating, easily avoidable horsecrap.  The environments look fantastic, easily AAA quality, and the voice acting is nice, but the gameplay is a complete mess. After nearly 30 hours of play, I'm just done. I'm sick of hoarding scrolls for no reason. I'm sick of being bored because necromancer is the only way to play. I'm sick of the plot going at a snail's pace. I just can't do it. This game feels like it was made 20 years ago, and that's not a good thing. Stuff like this isn't in RPGs anymore for a reason.  Say ""git gud"" all you want, it's doesn't help. The game isn't about getting good. I never felt like I was learning the combat or different strategies. In fact, I felt like I was actively punished for saying ""maybe I shouldn't rely on this all the time"", because then I'd have to buy a dozen skillbooks to be brought up to speed in a skill that I hadn't used.  I don't get it. I don't understand the love, I don't understand the fun that can be derived from this.

While I don't consider myself to be entirely helpless when it comes to role-playing games in general, I feel absolutely helpless here.  The game tosses you into a completely open world with no clear direction on which path you're supposed to take, with a battle system that punishes your lack of mechanical knowledge and immediately scales into party-killing fights within the first two hours.  I felt that I had two options going forward - replay the game on the lowest difficulty until I could understand it, or invest my time elsewhere.  I choose the latter."

If you like organizing and cleaning, this is the game for you.    That being said, the RP aspect of the game is very solid.

398,wm.j.olson,138,33,5,"September 15, 2017",Not Recommended,26.3,"This issue of the game has serious balance problems. Virtually every fight early on you face opponents who individually or in the 'army' they can summon immediately overwhelm. There is basically no way to win confrontations with over-powered enemies. Enemies you stumble into are always levels above you or your team, armed with better weapons, have more skills, and better protection.  The learning curve depends on saving every turn and reloading when you lose, only to stumble into anothr no-win situation.   In the meantime, because everything you can buy is overpriced and what you sell mostly sells for peanuts, you can't earn money to buy better stuff.  Nor is it possible to complete missions and engage in combat to improve skills. So constant save and reload to dodge encounters, which of course means you can't earn experience just rinse and repeat hoping for the best the next time.  You can create your own character but you can't save it.  So, if you want to start again, you can't load the character you created.  There's basically no in-game tutorial that helps or explains what's going on or what to look for.  The few things covered have descriptions that are next to useless.  You can choose various skills with weapons that require certain attibutes, like finesse.  Fine.  What weapons does that support and where do you find the answer?  Someplace like YouTube or discussions elsewhere other than the game.  Compared to the other Divinity games, this one comes up short.  There's a system to identify collectable objects, since the game world is full of things, but the system doesn't cover much of what is there, so it's trial and error, hit and miss.  The game is now out of early access but it feels and plays like much remains to be done and it is not clear if the developers will respond to the need."
399,Tjaranis,181,10,0,"September 17, 2017",Not Recommended,37.7,"Ok so whats wrong with the game:  1.	Controls are really bad in combat, you can barely zoom, clicking your characters to do something is tricky and I’ve had 3 times I’ve lost an extremely long and hard fight because the game didn’t register that I clicked a character with a skill and instead just walked like an idiot. 2.	Skill/attack look is boring/bad It looks/feels exactly like the style of game before 2000, there have been done nothing to make it feel like an actual battle, so combat looks incredibly dull and boring. 3.	Balance is utterly crap, like every DnD based game you either build exploitive and become OP as hell, or build as you like “rp wise” and suck hard at the game (stats means so much bc dnd system). 4.	It is both exceptional linear and at the same time there is no redline to follow. So you need to progress and the game is all about getting from story point A to B and there is little to do in between, but the guidance of the story, motivation and making you feel there is a story at all just isn’t there. So I must admit after 5-6 hours in the game (19hours played) I had +- given up on the story, not because it would be to hard to follow but because it was pointless as nothing I did had any effect (killing all guards, prisoners still just stand stupid. Winning arena, npc only remove neck from your main ignore the rest of the team. Interactions are very limited and there is no feeling of atmosphere or reason to do anything or not do something. Its trail and error on what works and doesn’t). 5.	Its locking all your costumization on ONE click, so better not misclick when checking what stats does or you have to reload/reroll. Costumizations are like all other DnD systems “read a guide or replay a LOT”. edit(you can costumize later on a ship, but even here switching companions will be insanely expensive as they dont have the skills and thats another issue with skill pricing and acquirement) 6.	Battle’s difficulty goes from “easy mode one fight” and 2 seconds later it is just “2war,2wiz,1boss,2 monster” and roughly double the power of your team. Not impossible but the absurd difference is just ridicules. 7.	NPC’s and You. It doesn’t seem at all like they tested stuff, so as an undead I’ve had someone ask me to bed by touching me, had the text say I got drunk (even though I am immune), having my heart beat quickly etc. idiocy… 8.	The game just isn’t fun, it is average when its good and rage worthy for every time you reach bugs, misclick, unfair fights out of nowhere, etc. 9. it feels like you are a creature from another dimension and nothing you touch or do in the world changes in the dimension the npc's are in, so you can interact with them but nothing you do to the world around them ever changes in their mind/dimension. this also makes it feel very immersion breaking.  So I cant recommend it. To much focus on recreating an exact copy of the pre 2000 rpg’s instead of improving much more on it both animation, story, and living world wise.  edit: explosive corrected to exploitive, not sure if it is a word but we all know what it means ;) and typo's. added 9."
400,Gordon the Otter,576,10,1,"September 20, 2017",Not Recommended,392.5,"edit: i recomend playing past act 2 of the game to fully understand what i mean in my review, because acts 1 and 2 are amazing and i know many people will see that over the later parts of the game  the game starts out fantastic, but it solve dissolves into crypic riddles and secrets yoru just suposed to know. the puzzles start giving less hints and arent connected to anything at the finial part of the game your suposed to figure out all on yoru own where a serect vault is under a house to which that is the only information given to you as a hint. and near the end you fight enemies in which respawn apon death, i had to switch to the easiest mode to pass them due to the glitchy mess some late game areas are, not to excuse their lack of explination. the endings are also a muddy choice of ""because i was told do to"" and none of the characters properly respond to why you did somethign, only that it was done, i cant become divine for them and help them and myself, the game assume i became divine to help only myself. the only time the game mostly sees you as a hero is when you basicly kill yourself, to which again no character properly reacts to it [explination is a spoiler]  you can kill the current god than choose to remove source [what the current god wants to do] and the game rolls with the idea you just submitted to the current god, rather than kill him   the game as of this moment is worth playing, but it does not feel  worth buying.  If you had the intentions of playing with a friend, be warrned the game treats both of you as the main player so both of you have to talk to the same characters a lot of the time. another warnning if you planned on playing any hybrid characters, like a battlemage, expect to be behind in eveyrthign from health to damage to utility forever, or untill you use a magical deivce which lets you respect your character as many times as you like after the first act  edit: i dont think its a bad game, just not a game i can recomend, but id love to hear other peoples thoughts on what i said."

402,Robobob,80,9,2,"October 2, 2017",Not Recommended,61.4,"I want to love this game so bad but just found it needlessly difficult and time consuming at just average difficulty.  It seems like every single enemy is capable of range attacks, area attacks and teleporting around the battlefield.  Every battelfield is littered with oil, fire, ice, poison, etc so that you can't take a single step without taking additional damage.  Why is does every single range skill have splash damage and alter the battelfield. You have to laugh at a game that gives you a half a dozen resurrection scrolls by level 2, because you know it's going to be a struggle.  The fights aren't impossible it's just that after 45 hours I'm at level 8 and that's half the time spent at mastering and completing games like Skyrim, Dragon Age, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate.  As an experienced RPG lover I find it insulting to drop the diffculty to easy just to playthrough.  And normal difficulty is too much so I guess this game isn't for me.

There's no direction. They want you to fail and die over and over again. They want you to be frustrated when their unreachable archer is pounding you from the top of the stairs with no LoS to get or attack him back.  They like stopping your movements mid way with stupid errors like ""Path was blocked"" and not refund any of your AP. They think Spacebar is a good place to put ""End Turn"". They like their combat system prone to mistakes of a single mouse click. Oops! I didn't mean to move or attack that, stupid game...  If you like to constantly save before every person you talk to, every cave you walk into, and after every thing you do, just to know that you'll be hitting F8 to reload it in no time. Dumb game systems. Very unpolished, unclear, and unfair combat.  The whole beginning of the game has no linear movement. They want you to ""figure out"" that you can't do that quest yet by dying or failing it and come back later. Every fight you are outnumbered and overpowered. Dumb system.  This game purely likes to waste your time and make your life more difficult, when it could make more sense.  WAY OVERRATED  No refund either. Steam has a ""2 Hours Played Or Less"" policy that they are strict with. 2 Hours LOL. That's the amount of time it takes to patch and restart the game and create your first character.

404,elise_paulis,38,5,3,"December 27, 2017",Not Recommended,135.5,"Been looking forward to this game for a long time because I loved the previous Divinity titles. I love the combat style, the humor, the dialogues, but sadly the game has become completely unplayable due to the worst optimalisation I've seen in years.  Even on a relatively new PC it´s completely unplayable after Act 1 due to long loading times and stuttering. It´s a common problem which hasn´t been patched as yet. The game demands an unreasonable amount of processing power. My PC has a i5 processor and a GTX 1060 graphics card, which should be well within minimum requirements, yet it's still a massive slideshow even at the lowest graphics settings.  It´s a real shame, because I really enjoyed the game at the start. Act 1 was great to play, with a lot of winks and nudges towards the other games in the series. But as soon as I got off the boat in Act 2 the game became completely unplayable, taking up to 5 minutes to load a savegame and half a minute to pick up a single item. Updated my graphics drivers, got rid of old savegames, set all graphics settings to very low, but nothing helped to ease the demands on my CPU.  I had to abandon the game after really enjoying the first part :(  Don't leave your fans hanging, Larian Studios, please patch this game!"

Bugs are literally everywhere, be it in combat, in menus, everywhere. Some are minor, some are major, some are gamebreaking. I bought it, but if i knew how bugged this was i wouldn't have. If you buy this game you're supporting a company that after MONTHS in early access could not fix something as simple as quests not updating in journal, player-created undead not getting their immunities (bleed immunity, suffocation immunity etc.), and even some crashes. As a QAF tester myself i can assure you most of these bugs were in fact reported, the developer just didn't bother fixing them thinking they could get away with fixing them in future patches, or not fixing them at all.

406,Asriel~,138,4,2,October 13,Not Recommended,262.5,"(First off, I'd like to say that I'm not a troll, and am merely attempting to provide decent information as to why this game is, as said in the title ""pretty bad"".)  I've played this game for around 150 hours, and during that time I've discovered countless problems. The main one that has caused me to lose faith in this game is it's weak plot armour. Sure, they've implemented the fact that if you kill anyone the game doesn't stop you from progressing, but there are a select few NPCs that are either unkillable or transform into a dragon and fly away (I'm looking at you Dallis). It completely broke the immersion for me, even though I know she's required to further the plot, it just feels rather improvised and that Larian could've found a better way of portraying their immortality rather than a variation of ""Rocks fall, everyone dies"". Hell, I would've even preferred Physical Immunity over this. The second larger problem with the game in my opinion is the combat system in general. I could list off a couple pages worth of issues with said system, but instead am going to give some of the more noticeable ones such as stealth in combat, which for the most part means cooldown reset button, the armour system, which is pretty self-explanatory, and AI's damage output, which for the most part rends the only thing between you and getting stunlocked to shreds. There are like I previously mentioned, quite a number of other less ""cheesy"" issues with the system that I won't cover in fear of making this a full-fledged book. Now that I've finished naming the two main problems with the game in general, I'll get into listing some of the smaller bugs/problems with the game that are less pressing but still somewhat irritating. Frequent crashes on loading a save, doesn't matter if you have mods or not, this will always haunt you. Difficulty system just makes enemies more spongy, including their armour, which makes them almost impossible to kill when trying to solo the game. Teleportation skill in general can be pretty OP especially when used in a form of ""Hit And Run"", allowing you to whittle down the enemies ranks before facing them as a whole. Crafting has little to no use in the game, unless providing boosts to weaponry. Linearity didn't bother me for the first couple playthroughs, but past that point, It can get pretty boring. Quests provide little to no information on where to go or what to do, instead causing you to blindly stumble around, hoping to discover the answer to a question, or key to a door. Thievery gives no difficulty whatsoever, allowing you to take what you please without any chance of being caught. Talent values are incredibly unbalanced, where some give you gamebreaking skill boosts, others do next to nothing. Experience is given in very small quantities when completing quests, meaning in order to keep up with the enemies, you have to kill a decent amount of NPCs, which can be pretty immersion-breaking when attempting to roleplay as somebody besides a mass murderer.  Hope this has helped at least a few people save their money."
407,StrangestSilence,102,3,0,July 17,Not Recommended,49.6,"Please consider reading, It is a long but easy to read and informing opinion of a disenchanted buyer. I used cheat engine in some parts --it doesn’t contain spoilers, obviously-- Remember that in all my playthrough I looked forward to use the least ressurect spells that I could, because they are pretty expensive to buy and steal. This is very important on the criticism that I have  The story seems to be nice and it revives aspects and character from the first game (which is not required to play in order to understand this one), and certain things that bothered me in the first still continues on this game, like the little lore things being only explained by the books, traps in ridiculous places (like under a sinked boat. A sinked boat….) and the unclearance of ---certain--- quests, I say it cause the first game didnt give you at all, sometimes you selected any random dialogue cause you get bored by the voice of the character, the way she speaks or even cause she speaks too much and even tho you can still do it, the journal and the map helps much more  The skills are better to learn, requiring you to just level up your memory in the attributes menu instead of levelling a skill to its maximum to find out that you can only learn 3 master skills like in the first game. Also, there is no distinction over the rank of a skill, a skill is just a skill like its supposed to be.  The traits are now a dialogue option, but you don’t get them so easy and as far as I played I only get “hero”, not even giving me bonuses for my conducts  The beginning of the game leaves you stranded on the island youre supposed to get with only the items of the class that you chose, and it stays like that for pretty much the rest of the day. And I mean it, at the end of the day (if you get immersed in the history and the dialogues) you will find yourself wearing the same clothes, cause is hard as hell to get money to buy things for your characters and you only start getting things after lvl 5 or so. But don’t think my complains make no sense, cause it takes some time for you to get there and actually nice items are only in act 2 forward   You got to choose neo, rather this armor go to this fighter or this knight. At the end of the day someone is going to die anyway…. Jokes on you for buying resurrect scrolls!  “Oh but I can pickpocket” No. just, no. you can only pickpocket NPCs once for character. I couldn’t find a reason for that cause you can get high amount of money in late game, which translating is about 15 hours to 30, if you don’t take a thievery skill right at the start youre ♥♥♥♥ed up, the next point in ‘civil abilities’ will be only at level 2 (it means a simple fight at the beach), then 6 or something. If you want a thief in your crew be sure to skip all combats as soon as you get to the island and ask Sebille to join you (at the south, right before the sand next to the doctor)  If you pickpocket someone to get items at the beginning, you wont be able to do it again for the rest of the game with the character chosen. This game is all about choices, a full dps character? A dirty thief? A support mage? A tanker? Should I get this skillbook that my party really need or this chest armor that my warrior need in order to keep ♥♥♥♥♥es away from the source of damage? Cause I don’t only have WHEIGHT limitations over what I can steal, I also have VALUE AT THE SAME TIME. Of course it upgrades, but till that point is 20 hours of pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and in the back until you don’t even need to pickpocket anymore    That’s why I don’t used to pickpocket resurrect scrolls  “But why all of this items matter? I can be polite and educated, and thus, avoiding battles!” You’ll have to battle sometime. And the battle changed for worse, much much worse  —DOS 2 adopted a system which you need to be pretty much a NUKE in order to crowd control or even kill someone.—  You have armors now, which means that you can get a battering ram in your face and not get knocked down (if it don’t break through you armor) and you can walk in fire without get burned, sounds good enough, right?  WRONG, FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKE NO  Remember when I told you that for the time that seems like an eternity you will get no equipment? That means nothing or close to nothing protection while the enemies have around 100. So the choice gets harder now, cause a thief isn’t really helpful in early battle if you want it to be a proper thief from the beginning, and a tanker wont deal the damage like the thief does   My first battle issue was with the AP bar, that makes you do everything with just one AP and just use the rest to walk or use skills. It gives too much power to one point and limits me in a certain way instead of making walking more easier, for example. Sure you can walk further more with this system, but walking does not deal damage. I look at a bar with 6 AP and it makes me desperate, im in a fight with 6 guys, has to control them, my armor will vanish by the second turn, and the enemies cleverly do not target the tank, and just one AP sometimes feel to turn the tides of the battle. Sometimes I believe that it was intentional, as the elves got an ability to recover AP points  Another battle issue is that DOS 1 doesn’t requires you to talk to everyone in normal difficulty, when it’s the first time playing the game its actually nice to talk and to know everybody, but when you are playing for the second time (or created a second party cause you didn’t know what the game was like in your first playthrough) you want to skip some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and jump right to the almighty battle (which is the best, damn the game just nailed it). I am talking about the first game, in classic mode, in the first location, that lets you go anywhere that with some effort you manage to kill the enemies. BUT, if youre going to play on tactician mode, the game makes the path in which you are supposed to follow very clear, it makes a crowd of enemies with 3 level difference almost impossible, depending on who youre fighting with DOS 2 is always in tactician mode my dudes. Always. If your strategy is not the best (especially in the first act) prepare your♥♥♥♥♥ cause you are the lucky boi that depends on luck and luck alone.  Luck that you will hit that strike, luck that the AI wont strike that character, or wont go that way, or luck that he will slip in the ice (most likely wont) luck this and luck that. Unfairness   It makes me force to load and save almost constantly, which is something that I barely did in DOS 1 (except for those ridiculous rock paper scissors minigame, im glad that they’re gone)  DOS 1 has a scalling problem with skills, the game gets easier when you start the second “act” or second map, I guess the armor is a lazy way to balance that out  Now, I guess is time to explain cheat engine issue. There is no better situation than the boss that finishes the first act, it goes like this:  You are greatly outnumbered and can use the scenario at your favor in one specific place only, so you do You struggle to create a crowd control because  	1 – you are two levels below the boss and this hasn’t being a issue at all until now 	2 – at least 3 guys got a armor almost the size of your health 	3 – you cant pierce through any armor, cant stun, cant knock down 	4 – only one character has teleportation, but only one doesn’t know how to climb down stairs anyway You manage to not get anyone of your party killed in 3 rounds, isolate some guys and seems to be doing fine You finally pierce through the boss physical armor, but the jokes on you because now everyone is blind The whole party got half of HP A GIANT WORM GETS OUT OF THE EARTH AND IT HAS DOUBLE THE AMOUT OF THE BOSS’S HP AND ARMOUR, THE ROOM BEHIND YOU IS CURSED AND THE OTHER ON YOUR SIDE GOT 3 OHKO JESUS WANNABE ***YOUR TURN***"

409,Hagaroth,10,9,3,June 24,Not Recommended,49.7,"So after about 40+ hours in a single playthrough of this game I got to the end and just quit. This was a slow build up to me quitting that started with the end of Stage 1 of the game. At the end of stage 1 it turned out that I had missed about 5-7 quests and 2 party members that I did not know existed or could have even been party members. So I had 2 less options in party members right off the bat. This is because in this game you have to go through the grueling task of talking to every single character, read every single book, click every single opbest that can be clicked, and read through every single piece of dialogue. However, doing all of those things is not rewarding at all. It's not like there are 5 objects to click and 1 of them leads to a quest. No, there are 100 objects to click and 1 leads to a quest, or rather a single part of a 20 long chain of quest updates before you can actually finish 1 quest.  The dialogue in this game is highly acclaimed by a lot of people as being in depth and complex, but it is not. Everything you say comes down to light side or dark side and there is no in-between. I started out the game reading every single line of dialogue and carefully considering every choice I made, until I found out that simply mashing 1 did the exact same thing 99% of the time that I wanted to do anyways.  Combat is slow and there is no way to speed it up. It is also boring because while the game's creators boast that there are so many skill options and build options (which to their credit there is), only about 3 are viable. I started the game on the middle difficulty and lost the second fight of the game 3 times. That should not be possible. So then I went to Google and found out that apparently I chose the weakest build. Yay! After getting the right build (and scaling down the difficulty to the lowest setting) I found out that combat was a simple ""if A, then B"" and then you win. Not very strategic. Even on the lowest difficulty though I found some fights taking over an hour to do, most of that time being spent watching the enemy move slowly and casting animations. Even if you love this combat style, it is so slow you will come to hate it.  Exploration is a must in this game, but it becomes really tedious. The quest updates are unhelpful and vague. Not even Morrowind vague like ""go southeast and the object is in the Cave of Whatever"". It is more like ""Huh, the object isn't here, we will have to find it."" Great, where do I start to look for it? Everywhere, is the game's response. Go everywhere, talk to literally everyone, and after 3 hours of that you just might find it, or Google it. I started the game loving the exploration, and ended it by just Googling everything because 40+ hours in a single gameplay, the vast majority of it was running around the same area I had been in before trying to figure out where to go next. That is where your time will go. Not exploring the wonderful world they made for you, but running around bored out of your mind because you just want to finish the quest and move on. This occurs for the main quests too, not just side quests. The side quests range from super easy to get through, with flags on the map telling you where to go, to forget trying to figure it out and just Google it.  Play time is boasted as 100+ hours of gameplay. Not really. If the game was as simple to follow as Skyrim and the combat about as quick, the game would be about 20 hours long. Instead of it being like that they make things purposefully difficult to find and follow and get through so that you have to spend more time. It didn't make the game richer for me at all, just boring.  Quests get worse and worse as the game goes on. All of the great stuff that you can do and how seemingly innocuous things lead to big quests are literally at the start of the game. That is because each quest has progression points until you finally finish it. That is all well and good at the start of the game where there are 3-5 things to do to finish a quest, but after the first stage of the game it becomes like 10-20 things you need to do to finish 1 quest, and each section of the game has 10 quests. The quests are also set up like the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Do A, which leads to B, and so on until you are done. However, unlike Witcher, doing A gives you no clues at all as to what B is. So each quest takes forever and a day to do, unless you just Google it, but then all of the fun of figuring it out is gone, but if you do try to figure it out it takes so long that it isn't fun anyways anymore.  Puzzles are scattered throughout the game, but they are Skyrim levels of ""Just Google it"". Basically the puzzles go ""hey, guess the 5 letter combination,"" so you try 1 combination, die, reset, try another, die, reset, rinse and repeat. Fun.  Story. The story is the same as every Elder Scrolls game, and Elder Scrolls does it better. Seriously, without posting spoilers, it is literally the exact same thing.

414,Arnuph1s,181,2,0,"September 29, 2017",Not Recommended,11.9,Great story let down by a poor game experience.  Let me start by saying I love Larian Studios. I like their style and ideas. I have been playing since the first Divinity. However my favorite entry in the series is still Divinity II. I loved the third person engine in that game and it felt like a step forwards for the series. Sadly the last two Original Sin entries feel like a step backwards. Not in story but in execution. Try as I might I just cannot get into the Isometric style of this current game. The story is great but the gameplay is frustrating. Not being unable to climb up onto a ledge that is one foot higher than the one I am on just got too frustrating. Especially when on the very same map you can traverse a rock slide. After the umpteenth 'Cannot Reach' message and having to spin the view around to see where I was I just gave up. I enjoyed Baldur's Gate as much as the next person.. back in the 90s but please for the next one (and I hope there is a next one) consider a better engine. Or just improve on the divinity 2 one.

I have to say it hasn't been an enjoyable experience. In fact it's been masochistic. It's almost as though the developers wanted to punish the gamer for playing this style of game.    It's been a laborious grind to achieve levels, forcing one to kill all types of NPCs to gain levels simply to take on the progressively demanding elements of the game. The parsimonious way in which leveling opportunities are availed to players is frustrating. Creatures or challenges do not re-spawn and paired with the weak continuity of the game narrative, a player is forced to roam haphazardly throughout the world in search of clues. Essentially an exercise in wasting time.   Not a game I recommend if you like fluid continuity in the gaming experience. A good example of a game that flows is Grimm Dawn.   Furthermore, the camera angles are terrible. It's almost as though the developers got lazy and didn't wan't to render a horizontal third-person perspective. I've honestly never seen a game where such a perspective isn't included. And I think it's a poor way of increasing the difficulty level of a game.  One could argue that eliminating a mouse, keyboard or decreasing the viewable space of  world could increase difficulty but that is truly low hanging fruit.   I truly don't see what the vast appeal of the game is. And because there are no trial versions of the game You'll have to risk playing the game before you'll know if it's for you.   Good luck."

I did my research and thought this game sounded nice. I started on medium, and I realized two things. One: the battles are stupidly hard, you barely stand a chance against things your own level, Two: the complete lack of ways to gain XP or make money make progressing a slow druge through terrible battles that I just have no time for. Sucks they decided gateing the story behind tedium was the way they wanted to go.  I understand a lot of people enjoy this type of thing, but for my taste this is FAR too slow. The witcher 3 I think is an example of a game that does this right, it feels difficult but it also feels like you can do things to curb the difficulty when you need to, grinding or going on side quests. This game does nothing to point you toward any side quests or even give you options to grind for gold / xp so you can progress. Sad but to each their own. Enjoy guys, even if I can't!"

That and the world of the game doesn't seem interesting or even all that unique.   I've heard that the ending is pretty bad, but I couldn't even get to it.  Not that it's too hard, I had to stop because the game world made me very depressed.  I've played bleak games before, but in those games I could always make some sort of change for the better.  The gameplay was good, but the story made this unenjoyable.   I regret buying this.  It surprises me to see how many people like this game.  I'm not entirely sure why I feel so horrible when I play or even think about this game, but I am sure that I don't like it.

Here's mine: Beautiful game with a lot of potential for modders. Most of the game I was annoyed and waited when the fun part starts and it never did. Story and it's ending was not interesting, Lohse was the only one that made me emotional (mostly because of the song), everything else was somewhat basic and hollow. It was just my own expectations but I waited there to be good humor like in D:OS 1. There was nothing funny in this game, lots of intestines and exploded monsters on the streets at the end and no one even joked about the ""gore"".   Spirit vision should be 'on' most of the time or you'll miss a lot of information, even necessary. Crafting was dull,♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of material but nothing else useful but scrolls and basic potions to do. Runes that enhance your armor/weapons can be placed only to some specific pieces and that pretty much settles what you are going to wear. Also most of the usefull or even moderately powerfull stuff to craft is available just in the last chapter because of drops, and it would not have been OP to have them earlier since the crucial drops are rare anyway.   Combat was boring and annoying and the best way (sometimes the only way) was to cheese the battle, even at the normal difficulty. Doesn't really make you feel that you ""git gud"". Also it became obvious very fast that when you see 4 enemies in the area, there will be at least 8 of them in the battle EVERYTIME.   I hated the physical+magical armor pools logic; if enemy has even 1 point of phys armor left, ie. knock down automatically fails and when there is none, it always succeeds, that system felt ""cheap"". Some sidequest lines seemed unfinished and left holes to the story (of course they were the ones that were interesting IMO). Skills felt very much the same no matter what skill line it was from; same♥♥♥♥♥♥in different package.   I think the biggest problem all in all was that there was too much of everything and nothing was made well enough, like an unfortunate compromise. I guess it's good/ok for most of the people but I'm not gonna play it again, in comparison D:OS 1 is now third time under completion. But hey!

Many quests are poorly implemented, with no direction given.   The difficulty levels are poorly spaced.  ""easy"" mode, is ridiculously simple, and makes it virtually impossible to die, while ""normal"" requires substantial prior knowledge of the game's spells, tactics, and item locations, and encourages cheesing of fights.  There is no ""I want a challenge, but without googling 3rd party sites every few minutes"" setting.

428,Lockebone,43,6,2,September 6,Not Recommended,5.1,"only spoilers are for the first couple hours.  Its definately just me but this game is not as good as everybody says it is.   The story is rather dull, and almost breaks the 4th wall multiple times in the very beginning hours. I see how little hours ive played but that doesnt count the time I have also spent playing on the console versions of both games.   Besides that. The story is plain, dull, and possibly gets better the deeper you go. But with 10 other games I want to play that have come out, do I have time to care about a game that can not set its hook in me after the first 10 hours or so of gameplay.   Having played and beaten tons of games of this genre. Let me explain why I feel this way.   1. The 4th wall almost being broken really perturbs me. Maybe I am interpreting things wrong.   2. The dialogue is veryyy boring, pretentious, makes fun of gaming and ADND type playing. Another thing other people don't see but I felt that way. Mostly when dealing with the NPC's and the reactions and way they are represented.   3. The interactions between charactors. So I am a source connected (potential terrorist) to the people in control, I am captured and sent on a ship to prison, basically a genocide camp. At this camp, the people are allowed to just wonder around, with that, they are allowed weapons, flasks of poison and fire are ALL OVER THE PLACE. Really? Wtf kind of government allows its feared people that it has already illegally arrested to wonder around with weapons.   4. For example. A magistar is killed right after you get to the island, I think partially to give you story info with eating her body parts as an elf or something, also to illustrate the pure cruelty of the magistars. Forcing one of there own kind to publically cut out her own tongue and then just blast her and kill her.  But me a source connected guy who OPENLY disobeys everything she says is allowed to just walk away, with a group of weapon wielding adventures on my heels.   I am sorry. I understand why everybody likes the game. It can be a lot of fun. But also. its not a 9/10, objectively its well crafted, with difficult controls even on a PC, excellent graphics, that show you details of items and people that have probably never before been seen or done in this genre of gaming.   But I cannot get over what I would call poor effort into the Sociology and Psychology actions of the environment and people living in it.   Weapons, flasks, potions and all those things should not just be lying around all over the place. Prisoners are never allowed to roam free, empowered mythical beings with magic powers and weapons of great power would NEVER allow insubordination such as I provoke go unpunished. The controls are tight but also complicated, detail orientated, and not for people who have trouble seeing small objects. As you can indeed zoom in, try playing an rpg like this zoomed in.   All in all, its a love story to classic games of the same genre, with twists put on the traditional gaming tropes related to fantasy games that seem to be put there merely to throw the trope away.   Such as the lizard folk being the intelligent ones and the elves being wild humanoids that devour body parts. Completely reversing how this traditionaly would go.   I guess my overall point here is this, like mass effect, the choices you make and things you do, to me almost seem pointless as the story will push forward no matter what, its overly complicated JUST TO BE COMPLICATED, which makes the mechanics not fun but more of a chore required to be used to play the game (my past 30 years of ADND and RPG gaming experience should be enough).   Not downplaying the amazing work done here for the genre and the fact that many if not everybody will probably have a good time with this game.   But ehhh. It could have been better. Stop riding the bandwagon so hard and really ask yourselves. Objectively.   Is this as good as everybody says it is?"
429,CoolestCat,144,26,2,"September 15, 2017",Not Recommended,36.2,"Great game, awesome voiceovers and story potential for party play. However two major issues that don't cut it for me:  Backtracking The level and gear progression seems off with the amount of content there is per area. You need to be EXTREMELY careful not to miss ANYTHING or else in the next area you'll get the message the mobs are too strong and get completely overwhelmed in sheer numbers and power.   For people that like to explore and check every nook and cranny this is not a problem. For people that would like to just get on with the story it's bloody annoying going back to old areas to kill mobs that have been skipped to catch up levels and farm gold to upgrade gear. The progression in this game does NOT feel natural at all.  Oversimplified combat The combat feels nice and original at first. But sooner or later it became clear that a few tactics that worked at the start can be readily applied to 90% of the encounters. I was expecting combat where planning and strategy were key to victory.  It lacks diversity and variety that could have been done much better.   It is cool that elements can be used as a combo e.g. oil + fire. The cooldown of skills need to be looked at though, because often I cast my spells and use my abilities, and then it's back to normal attacks for a few turns (not for all classes) which is boring and limits strategy if my only option is to autoattack when all skills have been used and are on cooldown for all partymembers. This is especially true early game, less late game when you get more skills.   If these points don't concern you then it's a great game, otherwise it feels unpolished and lacking."

433,Vorx the Siegemaster,448,5,0,"October 11, 2017",Not Recommended,83.3,"It visually stunning. It has some good voice acting and some cool backgrounds to the heroes. It even has some fun skill building strategy. I have over 80 hours in this game and more than that in its predecessor. I enjoyed the first one.  But that's where it ends. There are tedious puzzles (the ones at the very end of the game being the worst) and illogical mechanics (for example, you can't take any items from dead party members, so if they went down with the Ressurection scroll you're screwed.) The worst is the quest design which means a lot of wasted time running around trying to figure out what ridiculous element you missed so you have to load a save from three days ago. There are also issues with NPCs disappearing after certain points in quest so you can't follow up and close the quest line.   Top it off with another tired and boring story about the main protagonist being touched by divine power and his ascent to godhood. YAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWN. That's been old since before Baldur's Gate. So why not try to mess with the formula and do something different? I was hoping they would be a little more creative with a tired trope in CRPGs. I expected too much.  I gave this game a lot of chances to impress me, and in a few rare instances it did. But it felt more like a chore."
434,Nemo,19,10,0,"September 21, 2017",Not Recommended,5.2,"I brought this game to experience a traditional Western RPG with elaborate dialogue and detailed world building that I heard so much about. Hasn't disappoint on the dialogue front so far but ... I can’t say much more than that.  I started playing on Classic, the 2nd lowest difficulty, my success rate in battle has been about 30%. Maybe this is old hat for veterans of the genre but as a newcomer this has been absolutely brutal. There is little to no introduction to the combat mechanics - it has really made me appreciate the “handholding” most AAA developers like Blizzard and Square Enix provide.  Maybe I will give the game another shot in a few months - too late for a refund anyway.  Recommended if you have experience with the genre. Not recommended if you are a total noob and like getting into games quickly without too much fuss.  On a technical front, it runs pretty well on my setup. No problems there.  PS: I selected ""Not Recommended"" assuming you are someone like me since ""Yes"" and ""No"" are the only 2 options provided by Steam - it's really more of a ""It depends.""

438,Serpent King,117,4,5,October 5,Not Recommended,350.8,"I will be honest - I started out loving the game and went straight for the taction difficulty. It was a breeze until Act 2 when I arrived at Reapers Coast. Then it suddenly became impossible; every single enemy was 3-5 levels higher than me, they all had 4 times my shields, 2-3 times my HP, and 2-3 times my DMG not to mention I was always holariously outnumbered...   I decided I must have done something wrong because the game was supposed to be challenging, not impossible so I restarted it. I did some research, read about what people were doing that works well, and made a better line up. This time Act 1 at Fort Joy wasn't just a breeze, it was a joke. I made sure to be very thorrow discovering all the secrets and completing all the quest. I was sure that this time I will arrive at Reapers Coast more prepared and will be able to get around. But no, wrong again. This time I was able to defeat the weakest enemies around from like 10th attemt. The game went something like this: SAVE, DIE, LOAD... REAPEAT!!! This went on for hours until I slowly discovered half the map, talked to a bunch of NPCs, and did the easiest quests. And of course I had to skip about 90% of all combat because most of the time my party was wiped out during the first turn.  Now I find myself stuck. I can not progress any further for this reason or that, mostly because I get wiped out by enemies who are on average 2-3 times stronger than me. And honestly, I find myself out of will to even try. I grew up playing strategies and am not accustomed to being defeated by a computer, especially if I spent hours researching and making sure to do everything by the book and even better. The undeniable truth here is, the difficulty of Divinity 2 is COMPLETELY 100% ARTIFICIAL. Meaning it is not hard because the computer is a better strategist or because I am making any mistakes - it is hard because the developers decided to give the NPCs a completely unfair advantage. Even the enemies of the same level have anywhere between 1.5 to 2 times my shields (4-8 times my magic shields which is absolutely insane), 1.5 to 2 times my HP, 2 times my DMG, and higher initiative meaning they always go first... All I have to say is this - if you are going to make a game and call it strategy, don't be a moron and give one side such a huge advantage. So hey devs, what would you say to a game of chess? A game that I will start with 4 queens and you with 0? Cuz that is pretty much how you made Divinity 2, at least on Tactian Difficulty.  Also, almost all of the ""Boss"" fights are so rigged they are killing any enjoyment of playing the game for me. I am talking about the Hanag fight where she opens a bunch of void portals and my physical DMG party has no way of closing them so the only way through is a 4 vs 20 fight. The Gwydian Rince fight at the blackpits where the only known way to fight against 3 magisters and 20 voidwoken is to abuse a flaw in the game (such as teleporting the idiot into a tent and body blocking his way out and even then he manages to friendly fire my team with his stupid lightning bolts actually causing more DMG to me than the enemy) otherwise he will literally suicide by running through fire for a mile to ♥♥♥♥♥ slap an oil blob. Or the Alice Alicseon fight where she literally 1 hits my entire party on her first move... In the end I defeated all of them but I get no enjoyment whatsoever from having to restart a dozen times every fight until finally abusing a flaw... I have read that a lot of people struggle with these fights even on the easiest difficulty and what do the devs do? Nothing therefore personally I am never purchasing another game made by this studio ever again."

There are spots which are just too difficult to be called fun.  And there is no way to do as in most classic RPGs, where if something is too hard, you go elsewhere and grind up a level or two and give it another shot.  For a game with a limited about of NPCs they are all very cardboard.  Dialog options are limited.  Their ""shouts"" as they sandbox is worse than a half decent modder would accept in Skyrim.  The UI is awkward.  Like a odd mix of very old school RPGs.    Mostly this game feels like a reworked less fun version of Baldurs Gate.

Also HATED the combat since not a single combat every felt remotely balanced. Just not a fun experience.   Update: This game certainly is better with a full group of players, however, I'm changing my rating from a thumbs down to 10 thumbs down. You'll enjoy it at the start and hate it by the end.   Do you enjoy spells that don't do what they say they do, like last 1 turn when they're supposed to last 2? How about enemies that have more AP than you'll ever have and can attack you 3 times before it's even your turn, so that you start the battle nearly dead? How about having to game the game in order to win a fight since you're nearly always outnumbered by more powerful enemies?   This game also has spells that will be blocked by your enemie's armor but bypass yours like it's not there, enemy attacks that will go through solid object like walls and floors, enemy attacks that will wipe the group in 1 hit, chat options that completely ignore actions you took previously like they never happened, and a final boss fight that is so ridiculous and rage inducing that 9 out of 10 cardiologists recommend avoiding this game.  Yeah you get a lot of playtime for the money, but you won't get the fun or enjoyment that should come with it. If you're a masochist and play this trash anyway, I recommend using an undead elf that can talk with animals and focus on a strength build. You'll be OP and may stand a chance.

But combat is what eventually will let me drop the game after about 20 hrs into it.  Two major issues I have with this game:  1. Side-quests are pretty much not optional. If you don't do every side-quest you can find and if you don't spend time fine-combing the environment for gear and XP (which takes considerable time), you will fail at the inevitable boss battles because you are underpowered. You can compensate a bit with clever use of skills and the environment, but at the end, you need to squeeze every bit out of the area you are currently in. In an RPG, I want to be an explorer and not an (XP) vacuum cleaner.  2. A lot of trial and error, especially in boss battles. For me, an RPG is supposed to tell a story. Battles should be challenging and give you a sense of reward and progression, but this should not rely on the players to trial and error through a fight, ideally with repeated dialogue that cannot be skipped. Throw in friendly NPCs with the AI of a rotten tomato that add an additional random factor to each fights progress and you end up with a time sink of enormous proportions.  There were other minor faults, like targeting in fights that could be overlooked, due to the interesting story and the engaging setting but sadly, I don't have the time to play Alexandar or Lady Vengeance fights over and over again until the stars of (friendly and hostile) NPC align in a way that the battle is won.

It is really the exact same story with the factions just having different names. Graphically it is in no way a step up from Dragon Age 2, not even comparing to DA 3's graphics. Combat systems it is not even competitive with other RPG's with its faulty armor system. Patches tend to break more than they fix.. and tend to screw up save games.   This game does have some good aspects to it, the Origin characters and their individual stories are interesting enough. You are not bound to a specific class, giving you greater build freedom than in most other RPG's. The game is far from linear. And you can either kill anybody you want.. or be their errand boy/girl.   Recommend vs not recommend is not really fair.. I am not condemning the game. But at a purchase price of 45 USD, with the poor support you receive from Larian Studios.. your better off waiting on huge sale to purchase this game."

It seems at first glance that the graphic quality coupled with the RPG action would be enough to sate desires, but as an avid player of Neverwinter Nights 1(CD not the online or NW2) I can say there is no reward in playing this game. It doesnt feel fun and engaging like NWN1 or any other game ive played over the last 15 years. Turn based gameplay is outdated especially when you can afford to include more freedom of movement during fights and when you restrict that movement at its most vital essence (the combat) the rest of the game begins to lack significantly . Ive played roughly 17 hours of this have failed to get into it. Why is it I can look online and find a story driven RPG more worthwile in action combat dated 2002 for free when this game retails for $40 and fails to suit my RPG needs."

483,Paddy Mayne,85,3,2,April 26,Not Recommended,126.0,"Don't be beguiled by the large number of positive reviews! While there is a lot to admire about the size, content and look of the game the fundimentals are a mess and ridiculously unbalanced against the player. Forget thinking you have found a great new piece of armor or a splendid weapon that's perfect for you character, before long at least by the next level up it will be a vulnerability, stats too low yet barely worth selling. Every fight you are the underdog. Enemies, be they simple slugs to ghastly demons are vastly more powerful than you. It gets worse and worse as you move through the game as there is little consistency (in scale or the self contained universe) to the abilities and stats of enemy groups. There are few chances to adapt or plan unless you save every 10 seconds and replay every encounter over and over until maybe on some occasions you get a break. More and more its a case of flee or reload and avoid. My last encounter before I quit and wrote this review in utter frustration 2 of my party died in the first attack before I even got to have a turn. <Update just had a ONE hit party wipe out by goodness! ...whhhhaaaattt!> A fair and full review would need to be vastly longer than any here allows but in my personal opinion have now tried DOS 1 and 2 you best be aware its NOT D&D, its not Baulders Gate or Neverwinter or anything like.  You will quickly wonder why its goes from slow and ponderous especially in the first chapters of both games, to frequent gob-smacked rage in frustration at the perfidious onesided, almost solely armor based combat.  For a confused narrative very partially about stopping the use of magic its ironic even a slug knows more ridiculously wide-ranging spells than your party.  Occasionally my wannabe 'Gods' seemed to have powers to match their status. They could sometimes fight on an 'near' even basis, their stats miracoulsly creeping up to 'HALF' their opponents and given my careful planning and assessment. But then that was when I back-tracked to areas long by-passed or completed narrative-wise.   My advice: Only buy at a huge mark down, like 70%, or if you are a pedantic soul who spends hours studying stats and comparisions by your own work or using the (for this game) poor wikis and on line sources. Thats just me and I am in a minority.  Just try to be aware of what you are in for, the out pourings of admiration are I believe a product as much about the general state of PC gaming. I have bought it and will try hard to enjoy and play as much as I can, I don't like to waste money after all. It can be enjoyable and interesting and engaging but would I get my money back if I could ?... yes for both Divinity OS 1 and 2 and I wouldn't lie awake regretting it.  I am not a big fan of games that require you very often to leave the immersion to seek outside help with beating a game. To have work out what deals with a particular fundimental game mechanic with rarely any in game hints or advice sources.  Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen was an exception I enjoyed despite that.  DOS2 though I haven't bothered researching help much, it just doesn't seem worth the bother."

Thus summing up my first two hours, and only two hours in game.  Divinity 2 is a shinier old school RPG, that suffers from awful mechanics, and relying on save scumming. There is nothing to do when running into a problem besides loading an old save. While some may scoff and say GIT GUD, I simply say get a better RPG like Witcher 3 a game that is also complicated and deep without being aggravating, and relying on mechanics that were outdated in the 90s.

Edit: Picked it up again because I was bored and wanted a good RPG. I have 130 hours in this game, got near the end of the game, and, for some reason, only then realized that everything past the first map of the game, Fort Joy, was a waste of time. My main gripes would be:  -The initiation mechanic which killed any sense of balance within the already mediocre combat system -Zero roleplayability  -Story is poorly explained and executed. I tried caring about the plot early on, I really did, but it was just such a trainwreck of unexplained fanfic.net material that I stopped caring about quarter way through the game  -Massive railroading -A complete lack of space to roam around and do as you please, see above -The camera angles are worked in a way which made me constantly turn my neck to try and get a better look at what was happening. Never experienced this from any other videogame. -The suddenness of the lewd scenes compared to just how little romance actually takes place before them. Felt awkward and abrupt, but this could be due to the lack of interaction between party characters, which leads me to: -Lack of likeable characters. This is pretty big in a role-playing game, where gameplay is usually supposed to take a hit in order to allow more resources to be put onto branching paths of the story, characters, making everything else an enjoyable experience, etc. I only liked one of the six characters and later grew to like two others, but even then they had so few lines and barely reacted to the story that I felt like they weren't really there.  -Enemies often get massive advantages, both in numbers and quality, and near-always get to have their strongest character move first combat regardless if you attacked them first out of combat or not -Still fraught with glitches despite being out for several years now, had to keep restarting the game due to my turns being skipped.  -Has the worst quest journal in any game I've seen: ignore it completely and use Google -Large difficulty spikes are common  A few good things about the game though: +Tig o' dwarf bitties +You get a randumb squirrel riding a cat companion that sometimes gives you stuff +The plot actually got me really excited one time for about three hours +There's a lot of content if you're willing to put up with all the negatives. +You can be a skeleton  +You can bang elves +You can genocide elves  +Lizard babes +You can genocide elves  3/10 would not recommend, if you really want it then get some friend to buy it for you during steam sales for a quarter or something, idk, go read a book or something"

Even if everything else were perfect, this would make me dislike the game. Now regarding tactics, I don’t want to get into details. The two kinds of shields are really strange.

489,The Edge of the Map,134,3,1,July 1,Not Recommended,32.7,"Don't get me wrong the game is not bad and I'm not desperate for my money back. However, I can't reccomend this game when there are alternatives much cheaper and about the same quality,   First off it's very difficult for a new player. The game punishes you hard for things you couldn't be expected to know. For example there's an item you need to pick up right at the begining which is really easy to miss. I restarted 3 times and missed it every time. I only found out about it later when reading a guide.  Most importantly is the combat system. There's a lot of variety of things you can do. The big problem is the armor system. It makes having a mixed party of magic and physical damage much harder than having all physical or all magical. The fights are really hard. The enemies don't seem to scale very well but as soon as you get to the next level they become extremely easy. For example the first boss I spent 3 hours trying to beat at level 3, he was able to one shot my characters. I gave up, left and came back as soon as I hit level 4 and did it first time, easily. As I progressed the fights again became unwinnable to the point that I had to lower the difficulty level, something I never do. With the difficulty level changed the fights were then all far too easy. So the difficulty is either near impossible or no challenge at all.  If I could get a refund I would choose to take it but I'm not desperate. The game isn't bad but it's nowhere near the amount of hype it has got. I haven enjoyed it less than Dragon Age origins which is much cheaper."

I waited for months till the enhanced edition came, i was happy to play it on the couch and enjoy the wonderful world Larian studios created, they really did.   But for me the game crashes every 20-40 minutes, sometimes if i save after a fight. After 9 hours and ""redoing"" a lot of fights, i'm done. I can't do it anymore, the frustration is to big.   You should try it if you in that kind of games and if it starts crashing every 20 minutes, request a refund.  The crash is game releated.

513,Rage,140,2,1,September 9,Not Recommended,83.9,"This review is for the Classic version of Divinity: Original Sin 2. There is a new version of this game call Definitive Edition was released while I was still working my way through the Classic version.  The two versions aren’t compatible and I can't comment on the new version.  Divinity is a somewhat open world 3d isometric turn-based RPG. Think sort of Dungeons and Dragons with a different system. You create a character with certain classes and attributes and off you go!  The game gets a lot of things right.  A relatively decent story, great characters, fantastic voice acting, and lots of places to explore. There is so much charm to this game and so many things that I want to like...  However, all of this is really overshadowed by some other terrible things.  The first is that you never really know where to go. You spend considerable time simply bumbling around the world. The way the world is set up if you go into the wrong areas at the wrong time you will get absolutely beat down without mercy. There’s no way really to tell if you can do a mission except to the area and see the level of the enemies and if they are too high you know you are in the wrong place. There are also some areas where you have no idea where to go and just wander around aimlessly. This kind of stuff I call “wasting the players time”.   No wonder I’ve seen people say it takes 100 hours to complete a play-through, you spend a considerable chunk of it lost! The older I get the less tolerance I have for this kind of mechanic.  I just want to get through the game in a reasonable amount of time, and the game is already pretty long.  The second is the fact the game is so dang hard. I played on normal and I never rage quite a game as many times as I did this game. The disparage between your party and a group of enemies on +1 levels or even levels is astonishing. Many fights feel like the hardest fight ever. Even with the best gear I can find or buy my squad feels constantly outmatched. Fights can often come down to simple opening positioning and which side gets the best initiation. Nothing like the enemy getting a great initiation with big spells into a 3-4 man 2 turn fear that leads into an easy team wipe. It’s rage inducing and it happens a lot.  You feel you need to constantly quick-save because you’re afraid you’re going to walk into something and get 1000% wrecked at literally any moment because it constantly happens. To me, it’s super un-fun, but maybe if you are into that kind of thing this is up your alley. I’ve given up after 80 hours and will never finish the game.  TLDR;  A solid RPG that is marred by bad mechanics and crazy difficulty. You’ll love parts of it, then question your sanity, then rage quit, then makeup excuses why you should continue playing and eventually give up and curl into a ball and cry."
514,FUNKY FRESH BEATS,115,36,9,"September 15, 2017",Not Recommended,78.4,"Game has tons of issues. To start, combat. It makes me want to strangle the early access players for not bringing up such blatant problems. Almost all enemies in the game have nearly twice as much movement as you do, forcing you to constantly scramble around in fights, and never having the upper hand. Because of this, positioning becomes worthless. Trying to bottleneck or choke off enemies doesn't work either, because they'll walk straight through a blazing fire up to your backline and annihilate them. Then you can only run back 10ft, while they can run 20ft, and still attack twice. Enemy missiles tend to ignore solid objects completely, screwing your position. They also have twice as much range as your characters do, giving them multiple rounds of free hits off. Sometimes you'll both be on even ground, staring right at each other, with the same weapon, but the enemy can fire over objects while you can't because 'line of sight obscured.' Enemies also tend to hit much higher, despite being the same level as you, with only minor equipment differences.  Abilities are too weak to even merit use. You can hold two wands with poison/fire, and spam the auto attack, which will poison then explode the area around the enemy, as opposed to spending twice as many skillpoints throwing oil on them then fire. The only good skills are ones that involve movement, like teleportation, because as previously stated the positioning in this game is god awful, and having a spell that lets you immediately reposition is broken.  On top of that, the armor system is atrocious. The devs claimed that diversity is key, but what they really meant is that everyone in your party has to be hybrid otherwise you're ♥♥♥♥ed. And it only gets worse and worse, until basic enemies are just bloated sponges with upwards of 2-3 THOUSAND armor. And this time around, armor denies everything but flat damage and blinds, so basically your CC is worthless until you spend 3 rounds busting their armor. 99% of situations are better off being handled just by dogpiling and blowing all your damage abilities at once, hoping to burst the enemy down.   Drop system is bad too. You could spend 15 minutes fighting higher leveled enemies, carefully planning and strategizing, only to be rewarded with scraps of wood. Despite the fact that they are wearing nice looking plate armor and carried shiny, big weapons. Avoiding conflict is a better choice almost always, because rewards from actually killing enemies are non existent.    And finally, the RPG system, the biggest draw of the game, is horrendous. You have two options. Play like a nice guy ♥♥♥♥♥, or fight 10 people at once. Standing up for yourself or trying to be heroic is always met with getting gang banged. 90% of the time, dialogue will always lead to the exact same ending, no matter which choices you make. It might come to that ending through different means, but it never feels like you actually influenced anything.   tl;dr, the game fails in both aspects of what it was meant to be. DO NOT BUY until it has been patched, re patched, and then sewn back together. I foresee many refunds in the near future."
515,Rooba,306,4,1,"September 28, 2017",Not Recommended,95.5,"It's interesting, long, packed with turn-based combat and a lot of dialogs and hidden stuff you have to explore. Now, when we are done with typical overhyped idiomas, let's talk facts.  This game sucks, especially when compared to the first Original Sin.  Unfair: you play as a living skeleton, but you're not immune to bleeding, though similar skeletal enemies are; should you take Glass Cannon as your talent - you'll be the #1 target for all enemies' status effect skills; your enemies ALWAYS have WAY more AP than you do.  Weaker: this game is missing personality system that was there in the first Original Sin. Your characters talk to each other after some things happened, but all for nothing. New physical and magic armor system is plainly stupid.  Diablo 3: remember your tank had 3k HP in the first game and it was awesome? Now you need more then 10k to survive barely, or even more. Waiting for 330.3M damage numbers to show up. This is followed by a simple problem - items of level 19 are significantly weaker than items of level 20, for example, and mind the cost in gold.  Co-op is broken: some aspects of the game are ridiculously broken in co-op, like NPC getting stuck in dialogs, fights, where you skip the first turn because or something etc.  Bugs: a lot of them. The farther you get the more broken it gets. Looks like someone got quite a rough night trying to finish the game faster than possible.  Too damn long: game does not show nothing new to you. We played 80 hours and it's still the same broken game. You just get tired of it at some point, as it gets boring as hell.  To sum up. I love Original Sin 1, I tried to love Original Sin 2, look at my playtime. Me and my friends struggled a lot to go through and see the ending, but looks like it's impossible. Shame on you, Larian."

I was amazed. open world. randomized goals for every player in the party which allows traitory to archieve it. I saw huge existing worlds. so much ways to trick the other players. there was no end to the possibilites... everything staged.  Now you have linear layers of maps. The same story. non of my friends and me were able to play it for a 2nd time because the replayvalue of the game is non existant. nearly no encounter matters. its always the same. your goal and way is the same (not like they showed in the past).  My first playthrough was amazing. All great thats left now is the amazing fight system.  Nothing is random generated. One playthrough and then never again.  It would be soooo awesome if there  would be an open game mode. throw in the great fightsystem. a nemesis system for different parties like the magisters or black ring. let them affect the world. then fight them, shape the world with a smart AI system that plays against you. random encounters guranteed. it adds some great survival and endless fighting encounters over time. getting strong. rewarding. and then imagine they realy put in their acted and staged randomized goals for each player in it which they showed in the past, what could have been.  But nope. their effort went into a borderline open world and linear questline.  I recommend to buy this game when its like under the 20€ because its only worth one playthrough.

And the Combat being among the best Games that I've ever played.  However, it has several design flaws and bugs that really bugged me and ruined my experiences. I'm going to give this a negative review until some of them get solved.  - It's too hard to keep track of ongoing Quests. During exploration, I would encountered some Quest specific Events, without knowing that I did. Leading me to do things that I should not have done, result in the quest became close and unsolvable. Displaying a warning beforehand could really help. I know that it's Player driven narrative, but I prefer to have my quests solved.  - Shovel in Fort Joy. Even if there was a hint, I couldn't find it. And I didn't want to bring the Dragons along just to dig things.  - Trial & Errors Dialog result There was really little hints in the dialog that could show how the result will end up, making me do Save&Load again&again just so that I can clear those quests. In this kind of game, the results can be swayed by the traits of your characters. Thus, how the Players develop their characters became a fun part of it. But in this game, additional choices from traits do not guaranteed benefits. As such, I do not feel that traits are fun to play with. Please reference Shadow Run on this.  - Map & Key Object Display It took me too much time just to clear Fort Joy, with more than half the time spending on finding that exact thing to do in order to progress. I went pass both the drawbridge lever and the fort tunnel, because I didn't realize they are there. And then end up slaughtered the entire Fort before I could progress on.  - Bug - Not everyone in the party Entered Combat If a Party Member entered combat or flee, please teleport everyone in,  instead of having to make me select and manually move them one by one.  - Bug - Party Members don't follow Player This occurred sometimes. Party Members will just stand still and didn't follow. Coupled with the above bug really ruined it."

If you're planning on playing co-op I don't think you're going to enjoy It very much with the ridiculous loading time. It increases and grows as you play with friends, It's absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥ing stupid to sit through a 5-20 minute loading screen everytime you want to reload a save.  Let's say you make a mistake, your whole party dies and you'd obviously want to reload to a previous save where you can reposition yourself better to win the fight, load a savefile wait like 20 minutes for you and your buddy to load in and play.  This in my opinion makes multiplayer/co-op no longer fun, loading times shouldn't be this long just to play a game together.  Oh and not to mention there's alot of missing voice lines, images, and misspelt dialouges, I've screenshotted a few which proves it, I don't understand how Larian Studios can release this and say It's out of early access, while there's a ton of missing features as mentioned earlier.  If you plan to play this game solo and you don't mind a few missing features then go right ahead, you won't have much of a problem.

There are a lot of issues with early level encounters being too based on enemy moves to really be ""fun."" Some classes seem virtually unsable at the beginning of the game, for example if you choose wizard and take the fire spells you are recommended to choose you are essentially useless in most early encounter as enemies are 100% resistant to fire damage and plague damage actually heal enemies (a mechanic carried over from the original, but not implemented until a character has enough economy or experience to buy different types of wands for different situations). 3 hours into the game and I have only gotten plague wands which makes me feel useless in undead encounters or a certain set of slugs. Also, the campaign is very ambigious as to what you're supposed to do, and with the dialogue not being voiced reading endless text for hints that you cannot access after exiting paces the game very slowly.  I love D:OS, but I urge fans of the series to exhaust the first game prior to buying this one. While the multiplayer allowing you to play with three friends instead of one is a huge selling point, I would still heavily recommend the first game. 4/10 currently atleast as a first impression.

This is the single most boring game I've ever spent $45 on.  -Story elements are incredibly weak, lack uniquity -Placeholder plots are stupid -Character choices are very limited -Combat is bland and uninvolved -Progression is unrewarding/unsatisfying -Graphics and effects aren't bad but nothing to brag about -Sound design is nice -Dialogue writing is not nice -Controls are questionable; click-to-move is obnoxious at best and unplayable at worst  I have nothing to praise this game for.

I have played the game where we did well, forgot to save, had to replay doing all the same things and ended up doing terribly. This game feels like an RNG sim with no stratergy applicable. You can face the same thing with the same odds and constantly end up with different results. If I liked real llife gambling, maybe I would like this game.  It's hard to come back to, it's hard to enjoy in the first place, it's hard to get better at.. I just, don't get why this has such high ratings.   Okay enough critisising without any actual evidence to back up my opinions. Here is some in depth critisising.  I don't know about you, but I seem to fall into the same ""do gooder"" attitude when I'm playing RPGs and I've started this game from scratch a few times and every time I've restarted; it's completely different. The battles change dramatically, but the story does not. Like magic I guess. The story changes depending on the way you answer questions sure; but the experience in gameplay, battling and whatever doesn't change. No matter what; the battles will either be in your favour or not. When the battles are not in your favour, they suck; reload and try again because they will change dramatically. it's seriously random and seeing as you can basically control the world by saving and reloading, do it and keep doing it because it's the only way to progress. Otherwise YOU ARE LITERALLY GOING TO START THE GAME OVER THINKING THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT. The hardest battles can be beaten by this method and that's the reason the level scaling is so high. 1 level lower than you're oponent? The odd's are NOT in your favour, 1 level higher? The odds are. The thing is that if you want to challenge yourself and fight a higher level opponent, the only reason you will win is out of luck, not skill. This is not a skill or stratergy based game and by using stratergy I have failed numerous times. For a strategic player, it isn't fun. It's a gamble every time no matter what I do and the cost always feels far too high. Fighting lower level enemies is the only way to progress without having to reload and redo..... (which I have done far too much)  It took me far too long to figure this out so I'm posting this for the people that enjoy a real challenge; not a fake one. Fake challenges suck and aren't fun. Make a challenge that is actually satisfying to overcome and you have a good start to a game, people look forward to the next challenge. This battle system sucks. It sucks because it is so random and so unforginving. Real life isn't like this. In real life, You try harder to beat the things you think are going to be hard and a lot of the time, you do overcome them. And when you don't overcome them, it is completely devistating; SO MAKE IF F****ING DEVISTATING. It makes you want to do better!!!   My thought... I dunno. Take'em or leave them   :)"

That is until I reached the Reaper's Coast. The difficulty spike is ♥♥♥♥ing massive. I'm not talking about a little, I mean almost everywhere is a giant boss monster that can literally one shot your team with ease. The only method of killing them is to cheese them like throwing dozens of fire bombs to prevent regeneration, talking to them, then teleporting them to an extremely overpowered friendly NPC, survive waves of enemies so the portals finally dissapear while a character literally pours instant KO lava onto your characters, or somehow killing 6 wolves that give the already massive enemy a buff that increases almost every stat on almost every turn they get.   I grinded, and grinded, and grinded. I rebuilt my characters, I even got better gear, but these fights only introduce rage. As a Lone Wolf character, all these fights were impossible, since I could only have a max of two characters, including my own. I've gone through this game thus far using my wits, and patience. I've won fights that I was actually too low for, and even underequipped because I built my characters right.

At first I thought it lived up to the hype, but after playing through it for 50 hours, it became really tedious and annoying. It's pretty much impossible to play without cheating and looking quests up online, which can really take you out of the game. No, I didn't know those three random books of hundreds would be useful hours later. No, I didn't know that thing I sold was actually a quest item.

565,BlindIdiotGod,31,4,2,February 7,Not Recommended,28.2,"According to Wikipedia, this game is widely regarded by critics as one of the greatest role-playing games ever. On the strength of these glowing reviews, I bought the game at full price, although I wasn’t able to get around to playing it until much later.  Had the game been released in the late 90s, it would probably be worthy of such glowing reviews. But if you’ve ever played a Bioware game or … well, actually any other CRPG, you couldn’t possibly believe such nonsense after playing this. The first real problem is the interface. I've played a few isometric games in my time, but never have I found the view so restrictive. It’s impossible to get any real sense of where you are in the world. This might have been resolved with a decent map system or compass but what there is just beyond awful. It feels utterly claustrophobic.  The camera controls are wholly counterintuitive. Eventually, I found the control to enable you to move the map by panning at the edges, and this improves the situation a thousandfold … meaning the game is now simply boringly mediocre rather than staggeringly awkward.  I say eventually because there’s barely any documentation and the in-game help is about as useful as flood defences in a desert.  The graphics are okay, but nothing to get super excited about. The music is likewise mediocre. However, that’s not really important if the playability is there. After all, I’ve lost more hours than I’m willing to admit to Nethack of all things, not to mention the Dominions series.  But is the playability there? Sadly no.  I got brutally slaughtered on my first foray into combat. It’s rather demoralising to be killed in the game’s tutorial bit on the ship. At first, I put this down to my ignorance of the combat system, but as I pushed forwards I began to realise that the game’s “deep” combat system is just another word for “hard”. If a fight to the death between a special forces commando with a black belt in every martial art known to man and a morbidly obese hamster took place in the Divinity system, then the AI controlled hamster will systematically break every bone in the commando’s body, pull his entrails out through his nose, and grind the rest up for burgers.  (It’s at this moment I expect the fanboys to chip in, bragging about how the game is “too easy”, how they beat it on super hard iron ball buster mode, one hand tied behind their back, blindfolded and being hung upside down by a pair of nipple clamps. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we’ve all heard it before. You’re so tough and good at video games. Yawn.)  You have to be a tactical expert because the slightest mistake results in watching various internal organs being spattered over the landscape. This is, of course, extremely realistic. It’s also extremely dull.  Because the combat system itself is not “deep”, at least no more so than any other game. Gosh, there are cool-downs? Yay! And different damage types?! Oh my gosh! Optimised attacks work well against some enemies but not others? Oh, my gosh, I haven’t seen anything like this since … umm … Pillars of Eternity? Every Bioware game ever? Third edition D&D? Or any other game in the last twenty years!  C’mon, the combat system is bog standard. That’s not a criticism – these things are tried and tested and there are only so many variations on the theme. It all seems to work well, other than being bone-crushingly hard – but it’s hardly earth-shattering innovation.  Then there’s pathfinding. You “chain” your characters together so they follow each other. And follow you they do. Well, sort of. Because every now and again, for no discernible reason, they stop following you. So you switch control to the lost character and move him to rejoin the party. Except now the whole party moves to follow that character (again, sort of). And because you can't find anything because of the godawful camera system and the godawful mapping, it’s like watching a bunch of spice zombies stagger around a British town centre.  And that reminds me. What is it with all the regional British accents? At first, I made the assumption the studio was British and almost thought it was refreshing not to have American accents in a video game. But the more I listened, the more affected and mocking the use of these accents seemed to be. And the studio is Belgian. Is this some kind of massive pisstake because of the Brexit vote?  So given the gameplay is utterly mediocre, what could it be that has inspired all these reviewers to practically have ♥♥♥♥♥♥s over how amazing this game is?  It must be the plot, the characterisation, right?  This is the first game in the series I’ve played and there was no effort at all to explain anything about the setting at all. I wake up on a ship, with a collar around my neck, to stop me using magic, magic is bad. Why is magic bad? Why am I in prison?  In games like Pillars of Eternity, Skyrim, Morrowind, Baldur’s Gate, etc. you were slowly introduced you to their mythos, until you become immersed in the culture of the setting. But not this game – I feel like I’ve started reading the Wheel of Time from Book 8 and I’m desperately trying to work out what the hell is going on. I realise there were prior games in the series, but it shouldn’t be a requirement to have played them in order to get a handle on what the hell is going on in this one. Who the hell is Lucian and why should I give a crap about him?  As for the characters, they have rich backgrounds and a complicated tag system. You mean in-game characters will respond differently to me depending on selections I make at character creation? Oh my gosh!  Again, this is hardly earthshattering and even less so when the application is a parade of walking clichés, badly animated, badly voice acted and poorly conceived.  And once you get in-game, you have the really annoying narrator telling you about how the person you’re talking to puts their finger up their nose or picks their bum or has another foible that is meant to ADD CHARACTER. This is a stock-in-trade of writing but it should be a subtle organic outgrowth of character - instead, it feels like I’m being hit over the head with a brickbat. “Look, see how I pick my nose? This means I’m not a stock character who’s going to be dead before this scene is out. It means I’m a living, breathing component of a real, persistent world. Don’t you see that I HAVE REAL CHARACTER.”  They don’t, of course, because most of them die before the scene is out or are otherwise singularly unimportant and as for the ones that don’t … well, you quickly wish they did.  And this oh-so-important characterisation isn’t remotely consistent. Let’s take Sebille: the cold, ruthless assassin. She turns StingingTail into sausage meat if you let her talk to him. Yet, if you prevent her murdering him – a slight she will never forgive! – you then have the chance to rat him out to Griff. Lohse and the Red Prince both object – the Prince for cultural reasons, Lohse is just a softie. But Sebille, who wants the guy dead, pipes up that snitching on him is as good as murder!  The woman is an assassin! Her entire life is orientated around murder! Even if you conceded that’s she was compelled to do this by her Master, why would she be trying to defend the life of someone that she herself intends to kill? It’s one thing to say “I want him dead by my hand” – at least that would be in character – but instead she sounds like a trainee vicar dumped with a street gang and shocked by their terrible behaviour.  So far I have found myself trapped on an island, with no clue as to what to do next, no driving narrative, forced to take up with companions that make the office bore sound interesting, wishing that the big tentacled thing had gotten me after all. It must get better, I told myself. It just must! It’s the greatest CRPG of all time. But hours later, to quote Father Jack, “I’m still on that fecking island!” and so thoroughly depressed I’m starting to see why he was permanently drunk. "

I continually find myself much lower levelled than any opponent I find in the game, and am so limited by what I have to do that I can never easily find what is next.  I spend so much time wandering, and wandering, and dying, and dying, and this is all on the ""Normal"" (Classic) difficulty.

The woman is an assassin! Her entire life is orientated around murder! Even if you conceded that’s she was compelled to do this by her Master, why would she be trying to defend the life of someone that she herself intends to kill? It’s one thing to say “I want him dead by my hand” – at least that would be in character – but instead she sounds like a trainee vicar dumped with a street gang and shocked by their terrible behaviour.  So far I have found myself trapped on an island, with no clue as to what to do next, no driving narrative, forced to take up with companions that make the office bore sound interesting, wishing that the big tentacled thing had gotten me after all. It must get better, I told myself. It just must! It’s the greatest CRPG of all time. But hours later, to quote Father Jack, “I’m still on that fecking island!” and so thoroughly depressed I’m starting to see why he was permanently drunk. "

The new combat design philosophy is: ""every combat encounter must have screen-wide poison cloud explosions alternating with screen wide smoke on turn 1 and every turn thereafter. All enemies must constantly cast environment-effect spells (even turtles, alligators and dogs)"" Also, in tactical mode (the non cheesyeasy mode) instead of initative order turns, you now have alternating turns with the enemy group, which I think was set so exactly because of the new combat mess system.  It's a chaotic mess which looks awful and feels broken. Can't find the fun of it.   Can't really recommend."

578,Minde-LTU,102,2,1,"September 19, 2017",Not Recommended,169.8,"Very nyce game. It just has to much bugs. I seems that this game was released 3 months to early.   There could be some spoilers:  I found maybe 30 smaller bugs, and sevarl bigger: The final buttle to escape from Island - after I saved the game dissapered all my allies. Actually I did not realised, that's the bug, finished my several stories, come back, and they all missing. All my saves where used after that bug. Ok, I solo defeated the final bosses and escaped from island. But just because in classic mode the game for me was to easy, archer did not used any special arrows, I just used 1 ressurection scroll. All fights I finished with 80% helf. So the fights in classic mode are to easy.   And it's not tactical game. There are so much posibilities, that is not tactical game. For example enemy has teleporter. There are only sevaral common tactics. Put the archers on the top. And I used the trick to close the door. So I killed all magisters easy beeing  lvl 3. I let one magister fighter in the room, closed the door disabling magister archers and mages. Yes, that magister fither with dual sword was dealing damage 55, so with one critical hit or 2 normal hits he cut kill instantly my companions. But I  used the tactic that archers removed his armore (used the hart for double action points), and after that just knocked down him. It was the hardest fight for me, The second one hard fight was against the wich. But also, no oned died, I did not used any special arrow in any fight (just saving for hard fights).   I tried this game in hard mode. And hard mode is 2 or 3 times harder then cllassic. I prefer some game mode between classic and hard.   Yes, game is fune. If you fix one the most anoying bug and release more patches , I probably will delete this my negative review.   And the most anoying bug is fight vission system. It completely fails on some grounds. For example if some character is under the ark, he is out of vision in any way. If 2 charcaters are very close each other, but one is under ark, the second can't heal him or resurect or buff.   I could write the list with small issues, but I believe, that the developers already know them, there just prioritize releasing as fast as possible.  Ant this game is finished 98 or 99 %, but that 1% is annoying. I hate the bugs and hate rusing to release unfinished games."

585,Xaymar,386,3,0,"October 8, 2017",Not Recommended,50.3,"If you want Bethesda or Ubisoft style ""Features"" (bugs) this game might be something for you. It is extremely rushed out, seems to have never been tested as almost everything has at least one bug, has several glitches/exploits (infinite money, infinite turns, infinite damage, infinite rounds, ...), has soft & hard locks, randomly crashes when you are the Server and more broken stuff. One of our characters in the party had a permanent ""Warm"" status applied.  In addition to that, after Act 1 the rest of the game is way too fast and there is just not enough to do. We ended up staging a revolution against Magisters, Paladins, Demons, Voidwoken and one time even against critters. Act 2 is barely 2 hours long, Act 3 & 4 are about 1 hour total and then there is the next to impossible boss battle which is completely based on RNG. The final battle has a 1 in 2 chance to instantly murder your entire party, even if you fully build HP+Armor.  Basically, get this if you like being tricked into buying it by watching footage from Act 1, then get mad at all the bugs, glitches and exploits that you or NPCs may accidentally encounter and break the entire game.   VisualsThe game overall has an almost unchanging environment, everything looks very the same except a very few areas in which you then spend less than 5 minutes. Be prepared to see the same over and over again, because there is just no variation in the game.  GameplayThere's nothing really special to the game. It is a birds-eye-view kind of do-it-yourself RPG Action game with some elements of Story added in and Combat being way to overused to be anything special. There is also forced stealth sections (lovely /s) and forced PVP sections (yaaaaay /s), so if you were planning on actual coop there is none here in those areas.  BalanceYou won't find any balance in this game. Melee is overpowered as heck, Archery is completely broken, Mages are probably the only useless class as they either die Turn 1 or end up doing a little less than no damage at all unless Source Points are used. A lot of the spells need to be reworked as it otherwise makes absolutely no sense to ever have them memorized.   CombatCombat is turn based with each player having Action Points and each action costing these points. Unfortunately this is the area with the most bugs and is also horribly broken. If you test around a bit you can easily find a way to never have the enemy have another turn, but still resetting all your cooldowns and source points, resulting in ridiculously easy fights except in areas where fleeing no longer works because the plot device was turned on.  StoryThe story is your average ""Save the World or let it burn in flames!"" Story, very linear with choices that have absolutely no effect on the ending itself. The game could have been shipped without the main story and nobody would have noticed anything different as it is practically non-existent and was actually more of a side-quest until the ending came around. The endings are pretty as disappointing as the Mass Effect Colors endings, so brace yourself to be disappointed.  PVP""This games story absolutely needs PVP sections!"" - Larian Studios I don't even know why they put this in. They could have easily changed the sections to work for all players at the same time, not just one person that murders the rest because it's horribly imbalanced. To give you a run down, in the first PVP arena I two-shot the melee fighter after he successfully killed the ranger. Second arena we just gave someone the title and in the third arena we just Source Pointed each other into oblivion (Melee won because end-game melee > Range bug-fest > Toy Mage; seriously, mages don't do anything except statuses after Act 3 or so).

586,Canton,91,3,1,"September 28, 2017",Not Recommended,17.5,"The armor system is shoehorned into this game in such a way as that many class combinations that are natural in most games of this type are useless; and there is no documentation warning people of this.  SImply put, you don't want to be doing both magical and physical damage at the same time, because you are then required to force your way through both armor types; there is no good reason to do this.  The result is that many skills simply don't work together, and the clusterf#ck is worsened when you attempt to pick classes and skills for  your party; only to find out later in the game that you chose wrong, and are now underpowered.  The problem is that they forced this beta idea into the game without testing it properly, and documenting its effects.  The result is that you get to restart over and over and over again until you figure out what works with what.  Paying money to beta test a product is an extremely anti-consumer business model; especially when the game has not been released in 'beta' mode.  Short version:  don't bother with this pay for beta release until at the very least guides come out explaining how to build your party properly."

Wanna play as undead? Have fun with that, after fort joy the next area is impossible to beat and thats if you can even make it through fort joy. And thats only on classic/medium difficulty -Gameplay- Artistically the game is great and it really makes you want to love it but.... The gameplay kills it. you're tightly defined to what you spec into whether that be one school or two, generally not more than 3. low and behold just to make the game difficult and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they decided to make the enemies you face in the first 20 minutes of the game have abilties from 6 different schools. you will have a♥♥♥♥♥♥whos a witch who uses necromancy and scoundrel(rogue basically) abilties, who also uses pyro and hydro spells, who also can use nether swap, who is also apparently a polymorph because he can turn people into chickens. I could kind of get it if it was some big bad boss whos up in high level high difficulty content. or maybe even if i was playing on honoured mode or w/e (hardest difficulty).  Its also a turn based game that cant seem to keep track of who's turn it is. the game will bug out and give you or the enemies 2 turns on the same character for no reason. the enemies will be allowed to attack with all 4 of their characters at once whereas you will usually only be able to attack once or cast one spell per turn and thats if you dont have to run your♥♥♥♥♥out of one of the milions of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tedious damaging surfaces that are just everywhere because why the ♥♥♥♥ not, most of this game doesnt even feel like you're actually fighting it just feels like you're positioning yourself to use and abuse the surfaces to no end because theres no way to progress without doing it because thats the game. This is all while putting you into 4 vs 8 fights where every enemy is stronger than each of your party members. However, probably the most infuriating and glaring issue that make you want to slit your wrists right there at your keyboard is that line of sight only works for you. the enemies can cast and attack through walls, through the floor of the high ground, and from seemingly impossible angles and distances. Also make sure you save everytime you do anything anytime because if may just walk into some area you think has no enemies and then you're suddenly locked in a fight you cannot possibly win in any conceivable way. If you dont f5 save often and because their autosaves are placed in the worst possible places and times you will get put into the predicament where you either start over (not realistic if you're deep in the game) or you loose ridiculous amounts of progress because you have to load a older save because if you choose your most recent you will be immediatly placed back into said unwinnable fight. -""RPG""- RPG is a pretty broad genre but unless you're playing as an Origin character theres not really any RP to be found. theres confusing persuasion events that decide the outcome of minor inconsequential events but most of the time no matter what you say to an NPC they will give you the same dialogue option in response. even with the origin characters as party members you basically just get to watch them act their own♥♥♥♥♥♥out so you dont really make any descisions for them anyway you just get to comment on it to them. RPG 2/10  -Character Creation- you're just gonna confuse people having like 10 class presets when it really dumbs down to like 3 ♥♥♥♥ing stats. just let people switch between 3 or 4 its not like you cant change the stats to make yourself whatever you want regardless of what preset you choose. other than that the variation and variety is very nice however it would be nice if dwarf racials weren't so meta for most builds, dont wish the dwarf racials were weaker just wish the human, lizard, elf, and undead especially were stronger. 7.5-8/10 The customization is nice it just might confuse new people.  TLDR; Fix the Swamp/Marsh, Fix the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies in the first 30 minutes of the game with abilties from 6-8 different schools, FIX THE ♥♥♥♥ING LINE OF SIGHT LARIAN! Seriously fix the impossible areas for undead.  Edit: Also would highly suggest the workshop mod ""No psychic enemies"" the name says it all and the fact this mod even exists says a lot about the game.

The later areas are a horrible mess of design, approach, and just are unenjoyable from a design standpoint.  The devs have actively cut down on their own design choices to limit almost all builds from what they were capable of.  The game has a great slew of potential. It does, but it comes down to if you get off the CC on a fight, or let the AI gets its 2-4 turns to do its gimick on you. And that is sad, that there is no real feeling of power as you go through this game. There is only, ""Is my gear up to snuff? Are my stats right?""  And it isn't helped by the whole way the plot seems to unravel into 'what are they smoking' when you reach the act past driftwood.

If you are used to fast paced Games like POE and D3, this might possibly turn you off, since the overall Gameplay is very slow-paced, including (turn-based) Combat. it´s more about planing each encounter, positioning, reasonable Fighting, rather then stomping everything to dust.  It took me about 50 minutes to clear the first freaking scene (Ship)...including searching for Loot in Crates, talking to everyone and so on...  I was blended by the good reviews and bought it, but you just got to be a pen and paper-dude, i guess.   If you are especially interested and experienced in p+p-stuff, this is Game could be amazing for you. If you are looking for Grinding Gear, leveling up and such...stay away. (Also: No Endgame, as you might know from ARPG´s...Game and Character Progression ends with Last Boss Kill)  This Game is about possibilities in story progression and different outcomes (High replay value) rather than having a ""Main Character""(Equip/Skill-Wise).

616,Mashed Buddha,160,39,2,"September 12, 2017",Not Recommended,39.7,"While quite the polished experience, it's just not the RPG I'm looking for.  Did I keep playing the early release content to the end?  Yes, but I just found it to be disappointing in so many ways, and hoped for it to improve as I persevered. (TLDR at bottom)  The story:  Overly dark and centered around death, rotting corpses, gore, etc.  It's tiring and boring.  Then there's all the ""mystic visions"" and ""gameplay"" where you're wandering through some alternate dimension just trying to get out to the real map and explore.  It's such a waste of resources to create these disjointed little sections of the game to jam pretentious god-story down the player's throat.  Combat:  I liked the combat, but ultimately the battlefield is just a mess.  Is battle supposed to be clean?  No, but the combat in DOS 1 was much tighter and way more satisfying tactically.  While DOS2 makes interesting use of height advantages, it's often hard to get your characters into position in time for this to be useful, with limited action points and freezing/crippling/etc spells slowing you down while you cause no damage in return, and usually the enemy is already placed in advantageous spots to attack you from.  This wasn't a huge part of the combat (if at all) in DOS 1, where again, the combat was much better.  For example, the rain spell in the first game was applied to a specific area of effect of your choosing; putting out the fire on your party, or applying it to your enemy only for whatever reason (like freezing chilled opponents).  The rain spell in DOS2 rains over everyone, friend and foe alike, so if you want to electrify the water on the ground, you likely have to take damage along with your enemies, or take away burning from everyone on the battlefield at once.  The camera:  It's mostly okay by itself, although I wish I could zoom out a bit more, and tilt down to see forward sometimes.  But the main issue here is the constant barrage of Tall Things scratching you in the eyeball.  Broken ruins posts, tall trees and hills, ship masts, etc. You'll be battling the environment for the right angles more than you fight the Magisters who persecute you at every turn.  Which leads me to another disappointing aspect of the game: The environments are so hard to navigate.  It's ""open world"" but you'll struggle to find the exact right paths that you're allowed to use while moving around the island, especially while backtracking. Where are the open environments to just traverse and explore?  So many people compare this to Baldur's Gate, yet this has no relation to the open locations found there, or in Fallout 1 , the Ultima games, or even this developers first release, Divine Divinity.  And finally, when Divinity Original Sin 1 was announced, it was marketed as a return to the Ultima style of gaming.  And yes, while you can pick up any fork you see, it's really missing the exploration, openness, and true freedom of those games.  Ultima 5, 6, and probably mostly trying to be reminiscent of 7.  There's no loading screens in those games and they came out in the 80s and early 90s.  No separate locations, and everything could be interacted with.  Yes there was less detail and simpler graphics, but less clutter and more freedom and satisfaction.  What did I like about the game?  I don't hate the combat, it's been fun at times.  Some of the characters are interesting, especially the NPCs who will join you (or you can play as, likely opening other story possibilities).  The challenge of getting out of Fort Joy and having multiple ways to do it, finally getting strong enough to go back and take out the enemies that needed to be avoided initially was satisfying.  I'm sure the replayability in the early game is appealing to some, but I rarely replay games and that doesn't make or break a game for me.  NPCs do react pretty well to the specific character you created (you have [ELF] dialog if you chose that race), and there are a decent amount of skill checks, which I like.  Talking to animals is neat.  Maybe Act 2 improves.  It will certainly be interesting to hear the voices I imagined get replaced by real voices.  TLDR: So if you don't mind my gripes, then all the power to ya, keep playing and replaying.  But if you haven't played the game and are looking for a more open, less cluttered, exploration based game with smarter turn-based combat and a more chill story, then this isn't the game for you."

628,CromX,214,6,5,"October 8, 2017",Not Recommended,245.5,"I cannot recommend this game. The developers have purposely taken every opportunity they can to literally troll players with instant death and unavoidable death mechanics that frankly turn this game into a chore to play. Simply walking a map which you walked a hundred times can be a serious chore, due to slow movement speed and then instant death from environmental things they set up that you can never see coming. Case in point covering a portal marker with instant death fog. A portal that previously was usable with no problems. And having no idea that they decided to put death fog all over that portal marker, you can port there and die instantly losing any progress you might have made.   These portal markers are meant to be convenience portal stones so you don't have to (slow) walk back and forth across the maps. So one would think they would not misuses the mechanic and the trust of the player in such a way. Not with these guys. I'm sure it was great fun, im my case I lost 20+ minutes of playtime. I had 30 mins to play before leaving, and  instead of satisfying game play I got this.   And that is just ONE example. How about playing for 10+ hours only to realize a quest is bugged and can't continue? Or having missed a valuable quest object hours back and the NPC you needed to see is missing or dead? You literally play this game in fear that your quests are all broken or not explained enough to where they make any sense. You can imagine the amount of reloading and backtracking that takes place in these scenarios.   Additonally:  1) atrocious inventory system. You never know which items will be useful later on, so you have to keep them all. And its ridiculous how much stuff you have. And lets be frank this game makes you interact with your inventory every three seconds which just makes this glaring problem unbearable at times.  2) overuse of teleport pyramids. In DOS 1 they had pyramid teleport items you could use in your inventory. It was quaint and used in some places to get around puzzles. It was never terribly fun as you had to trawl through your inventroy find it, toss one out, then trawl again find the other and then teleport to it. Rinse and repeat and it gets really old really fast. Well in DOS 2 they have doubled or even trippled down on this. EVERYTHING uses these lame pyramid teleport items, a bloody broken bridge just so you will have to dig through that ANNOYING inventory and port people across. ANNOYING. I get it they think their pyramid teleport stones are cool! WE GET IT, PLEASE STOP WITH IT!  3) PUZZLES, everything is a puzzle. And lots of time its obscure, or just a huge time sink. The occasional puzzle can be good for content, but like everything in this game its an overused mechanic. I swear you do one lame puzzle that takes like 30 mins and then in the next room over another one. It's gets old real fast and often involved trawling though the inventory and reading the THOUSANDS of books they drop during the game. Otherwise google it if you can find it. It's a real chore.  4) Fights often are just huge alpha strikes by the enemy that CC your entire party if not kill them outright. Its a frequent occurrence that you will sit turn after turn CCed until death.   All in all stay away from this game unless you are a die hard DOS 1 fan. I had been putting up with all those annoyances because for the most part I figured it was just the developers not understanding the impact all these minor issues were having on the player. But once they start trolling people with instant death at portal markers for god's sake its time to come to terms with the fact these are not the best of guys. They intentionally want to waste your time and ruin your game play, and in a lot of ways they succeed.  Stay away, or buy heavily discounted."

I win by abusing the AI and funneling the enemy then actually using skills and the magic and physical armor system only increases that by making you focus on dps to remove them vs utility or support classes. I could go on but those who understand what I'm speaking of will know to stay away until the game is properly polished and fixed, others I'm sure will defend the game with accusations of ""not being gud, and git gud""  Its a fun game that's held back by awful mechanical and buggy mechanics."

Story seems pretty interesting. -Characters in general have their own personalities and agendas, with some witty lines.  I have a few minor gripes with the characters and npc interaction, but overall I think characters are a definitely a positive. -Ability to change the class of joining characters is a great idea.  It wasn't there in early alpha so I'm really happy to see it now. - Animations are actually quite good, armor and weapon designs are thoughtful and race specific.  Aesthetic is impressive, honestly. - Environmental interaction and ability to combine spell effects with the environment is a very cool concept  Cons: -Prepare to spend hours trying to beat a single pitched battle with minions, let alone boss characters. -It's easy to create characters with absolutely horrid efficacy and no way to back out of those choices.  -The important set pieces have you either outnumbered (think 10 on 4 at times) and/or ambushed.  Normally this would be fine, since your characters will have skills and abilities that can get you out of said situations.  However, since in most ambush situations all enemy characters move first, you can easily find yourself stun-locked to a quick death.  Multiple rounds of just watching your stunned/frozen/knocked down/crippled/diseased characters getting ripped apart by enemies with a variety of debuffing skills that require no cooldown is just flat out boring.  That's not a battle, it's not a game of chess with the enemy, it's not preparing and having skills that can counter enemies (since of course removing a debuff with my 5 turn cooldown skill means nothing since 6 enemies can just re-stack the debuff next round).  It's a boring slaughter.  -Twenty minutes into a turn based fight, when a single enemy with 2 HP can stun 3 members of your team that have full armor that should resist the debuff, heal itself, and then teleport away all in the same turn, that's a problem.  Then proceed to restack the debuff every turn while you just sit there watching and have no chance to counter or do anything at all (since entire team stunned for 3 rounds each time enemy attacks).  It's just not enjoyable.   Overall: -I want to love this game, and I think there are some really cool mechanics to it.  But I have a life outside video games, and spending hours trying to find the right combination of strategy and luck to win a single fight is not something I have time to do.  I enjoy a good challenge, I just don't have 500 hours to put into a game just because I get ambush/stunlocked into death over and over again.  That's really not fun."
659,Jambers,169,8,2,"September 23, 2017",Not Recommended,1.5,90% of the the game is walking around reading poorly written NPC dialogue and searching the crates. Battle system is a poor D&D clone that results in every fight being covered in fire or other status effects. Camera control is poor and inventory management is as poor as in the D:OS 1.
660,nerform,94,5,1,"September 23, 2017",Not Recommended,1.6,"I have 90 minutes on record. All of this time is spend in the game menu.  Yesterday me and 3 friend wanted to play this on local co-op (4 joysticks, one screen). First 60 minutes we ware trying to setup profiles and pick them with the 4 xbox 360 controllers. This is not really the game fault (maybe because other 4 player games are working just fine). I was using Nvidia Shield TV to stream the game to my living room TV. All 4 joysticks ware able to navigate the menus but they all are recognized as one joystick. So no way to pick the four different profiles. It took a while but I tested this by connecting the joysticks directly to the PC and removing the Shield TV. From this point I was able to pick the profiles.  On the character creation screen all 4 players were shown on top of each other (including the right side menus). No way you can configure anything. We tried to just go with what was selected by default (so we can at least see the actual game). You need to press the start button on each controller. Unfortunately one of the controller was not able to do that for some reason. I was able to see that he can rotate the camera and sound effects ware there but he couldn't press start.  At this point we just gave up. Plugged the joysticks back to the shield TV and played some 4 coop Broforce (no problems at all).  I'm refunding the game now. Even that this looks as dream come true game I won't play it because of game menu bug. Cheers devs."

663,VonDodo,113,3,5,"December 27, 2017",Not Recommended,56.4,"Update after many hours.  The game puts a lot of focus on fights. Unfortunatley fights are plagued by the lack of testing, recent arbitrary nerfs and the non linearity (usually a good thing as long as you put some mechanics to prevent problems) of the maps.  I.E. its common to end in impossible fights you are supposed to face with more characters OR with quest items OR again at higher levels... and you can t figure out if they are supposed to be so.. because in the beginning you are too weak for almost any fight.  Second Same arbitrary nerfs not properly tested and some bugs ends up screwing story that instead would be nice.  Also you can end in dialogues that consider you talked to people you never talked to because story is somehow linear but areas are open thus they expect to follow an order that is not even clear and ignore if you do or not.  Some awful bugs for example are: 1) source nerfs (see flaming pigs quest) 2) teleport pyramids and much more.  In the end you can change settings to easy and change from total frustration of some fights to boringly easy the difference is huge between normal and easy.  Tag system is a really good idea its a pity this game seems unfinished and unpolished..... and trying to be difficult in the wrong way....with opponents being in most case teleporting fighters/wizards that shoot aoes from distance starting from better position.....  I.E. you also lose the freedom of builds and roles...."
664,Yoshiris,42,3,1,"November 11, 2017",Not Recommended,85.0,"Pros: The story line is good.  The battle is good.  Cons: The camera is aweful. Navigating the map is a stressful mess. When your party member finds a hidden treasure, he says he spotted something, but the map is so hard see that you can't tell where that shining mound is. The NPC will tell you of a location of a cave, but even if you are standing right in front of it you can't see the entrance. Exploring the world is supposed to be full of surprises and a sense of adventure. Instead it just feels like a series of rotating the camera in order to understand your surroundings.  The UI is aweful too. You can learn a few dozen skills in the game, but you can only see one bar of skills and need to toggle the bars all the time to use the skills. The only way to manage skill bars is by adding one skill or deleting one skill.  There is no sorting for skills so you have to manually sort the skill bars. And when you have your skills sorted and you want to insert a fire skill that you just learnt, you have to delete a skill in that slot, meaning you have to reorganize every skill after the skil bar. Maybe sorting is too hard to implement, but why can't we just insert a skill?  Inventory management sucks too.  There are mildly valuable things on the streets, but as you keep picking them up your inventory becomes a mess that you don't want to look at.  The content of the game, the story and the battle system are good. But the interface is so horrible that it is impossible to enjoy them. I would love to play the game if the camera is a normal third person view, and the UI gets polished enough or the game rule changes such that you don't need a polished UI (limit the number of skills you can memorize to 8, don't litter the world with trashes so your inventory doesn't clog up.  At this moment it feels like they made a world that they wanted to make without caring about how the player experiences it. They might think the game is strategic and fun when you have 4 members full of 50 skills and items, but in reality having to manage all these things is too much hustle."

As much as I love the combat system in this and the previous D:OS its surrounded once again by a tedious, meandering plot, and annoying, unlikable characters.  What's worse, is that there are simply no advencements in game play.  The once promised day/night cycles once again failed to appear, NPC schedules are still absent, and everything just feels like an add-on to the first, instead of a true sequel.  I can't say its a bad game, it just brings nothing new to the table, and has no real reason to exist other than to justify another Kickstarter. (which I was hopeful enough to back)  Maybe something new or spectacular will come along in EA, but the mechanics feel pretty set at this point, and they simply fail to amaze.    It is noteworthy I guess that their elves manage to out-ugly TES elves by a shocking degree. The lizard people are no prize either.  Character designs in general are simply badly misconceived.  Oh, and the control collar bit they start the game with is lifted in it's entirety from Dungeon Siege 2.  They didn't alter it at all. Even the models used look almost identical. "
667,Timmiii,83,2,1,"October 20, 2017",Not Recommended,188.9,"I there was a ""luke warm sligthtly approve"" thumbs up, I´d give it that. But no, so it has to be thumbs down  First off, I played D:OS 1 and loved it. Great challenging game with many choices, not only in combat but also in the path you wish to proceed forward.  That being said, D:OS 2 offers pretty much the same mechanichs af it´s predecessor, but only harder, much much harder. Allow me to break it down, what is good and what is not if you are concidering bying this game   Overpowered enemies   I don´t know what Larian was thinking, but lvl progress doesn´t seem to match the enemies you face. I play on classic mode, and several times when encountering an enemy that is your lvl, you get wiped out completely. Your whole party, usually within 2 turns. This is immensly frustrating, and you spend many hours desperately looking for for lighter quests to complete, so you can advance and gain the upper hand. Most enemies can only be defeated if you are 1 lvl above. If that´s your thing, punching keyboard and ragequitting, this is the game for you   Broken quests   Many times I have hovered over and around the same quest looking for enemies or items that were nowhere to be found, and once you have completed a particular quest, it is still indicated on your map as still active. Hours have been wasted waking around trying to solve already solved quests   Movement and turnbased fights   Your party memebers move around like they are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Most of the time they stop somewhere random and don´t keep up, or they see a trap and dive head first right into it. Happens more or less all the time. The turnbase fight could be alot of fun it they turnbased system were in any way fair, but it usually goes like this: First enemy stuns you and all your companions, drain all you armour, goes into overpowered mode and takes away half of your energy. Next up is the enemies companions who do exactly the same and you are molested very quickly   SJW enviroment (at times)     So - We live in a time where political correctness is of the essence, and the disease of SJW has infested gaming all together. For instance, a dialogue can go as following in DO:OS 2 (I exagerated a bit, to enhace it´s meaning):  - Ifan: ""So, Beast, we made it this far. I´m glad I made this journey with you. Good to have you around""  - Beast: *Smiles suspiciously* ""Yes, me too. Say, have you ever been with someone of your sex?""  Beast gets undressed, a major erection emerges before you, he pulls you close   1.) You push him away 2.) You smile akwardly and try to talk your way out of it 3.) You let him penetrate you 4.) You french kiss him, and see what happens happens  Now, if you are gay, that´s fine and I geniuenly hope that you are happy with you self and your partner, but why does have to in a game in such a poor and badly written manner? If at all? We all know why it is there, if not the game would be hammered for being homophobic and what not. Could we dial it down a notch? Pls  I wanted this game to be more than it is, I wanted it to be the game of the year. I its good, or I would say 50% fun/50% frustration. I am almost at the end of the game, and I can´t seem to make it the final strecth. I just don´t care anymore, too much frustration has killed it for me  Overall 6.5/10 - Just approved"

This game has a vertical learning curve and is extremely punishing of any mistakes. Win a few fights, have a few party member deaths? OOPS - you're out of resurrection scrolls, your party is permanently dead - unless you can find 1,000+ gold to buy a scroll (which you can't, there's not enough lootable items in Fort Joy Ghetto (the starting zone) to purchase even one scroll). From the start, the enemies you face are fully equipped with good weapons, shields, and scale/plate armor - whereas you're wearing rags and wielding a shiv or a makeshift hammer. Only on its easiest difficulty is combat realistically winnable in the beginning, but then it's so easy it's just meaninglesss. Unless you like facerolling on easymode or playing through the first zone a hundred times to learn about how to make a good party of heros, don't bother with this game.  I thought it could be the heir to Baldur's Gate and other similar awesome RPGs, but this is simply not fun. It could have been fun had the difficulty gradually ramped up instead of being a vertical wall of frustration.

E.g. how every time I talk to the Red Prince on the beach, his dialogue immediately closes, but only for my main character. Everyone else is fine :)  Have so far played well more time than supposedly this version allowed, but I've completed annihilated all of the magistrates inside the fort, which took a fair bit of strategy to complete.  Which hints on one point of joy; where I can move things around in the environment to block the enemy out and deal with subsections of them. Inside the fort, for example, I set up a small killzone in a side room and blocked out the main door. Then I teleported the main enemy into the side room, took him down, followed by teleporting each enemy back through for removal--seemingly allowing me to take many more enemies on than I would have head on.

However the camera controls ruined this game for me. I don't normally complain about camera controls but I felt often that I was more trying to position the camera more than I was playing the actual game. The fighting with the camera made the large areas with massive detail more daunting than exciting and exploration felt like a hassle. Another issue I had was the detail and the lack of significant marking on characters. This could be because I'm visually impaired but because there is SO MUCH on your screen at once and so much folliage and trees everywhere I found it hard to find NPCs and even monsters let alone my own party members.  I'm not saying the game is bad per say but I can't personally reccomend it however lots of people seem to love it so maybe take your chance on it?

I have never in my life seen a game so completely ruined in the final act as this game. I didn't even finish the first playthrough because of the last fight which was beyond my capabilities. Despite this, I put together a new team and went through it again (all mage this time). Yes I'm stupid.   This game eats away your time. It doesn't value it at all. You will waste so much time re-moving characters because they don't want to go through some measly poison or fire that they'll heal from right away. You'll waste time on every save / reload - at least 30 seconds on saves and 1 minute or more on reloads. You'll waste time reskilling your characters because you remove a piece of equipment. You'll waste time trying to target a character when your entire screen is covered in cursed fire. You'll waste time with quests that you can't complete (I can't believe that Tarquin bug still isn't fixed on my 2nd playthrough despite so many assurances on release notes). You'll waste time & get carpal tunnel with all the mouse moving to close windows that obscure you view. You'll waste time moving wares from one character to another because the designers choose to waste your time instead of just having one wares for the entire party. You'll waste time combining & recombining potions because they think that animations and sounds for one combine are so cool they couldn't possibley give you a button that will COMBINE ALL. You'll waste time when the battle is going on for minutes because the designers believe FIREBALLS should have a TURN.   It spits on your time, it constantly makes you waste your time and you perservere & trudge through it and then it completely vomits over all you have done & accomplished in the final act.   I'm talking about MULTIPLE stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battles -  and you'll spend so much time reading how to get through these  stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battles just to cheese them to progress and even those will be wrong.

However, beauty makes not a game.  The voice acting and options (MOST OF THE TIME) add a lot of flavor to the game, other times, does not matter what option you choose, the predetermined outcome is happening, screw you and your  well thought out choice.  I both like the battle that is turn based, and loathe it.  All of the fanboiz rating 9/10, and 10/10, and heralding GREATEST GAME EVAH I just don't get.  You won't get that here.  Here, you will get truth.  Hard cold truth.  Allow me to put on my ""GIT GUD"" armor on.  Ok now that's on.    I resent having to ""study ahead"" for my fights, even on one step ahead of casual difficulty.   When I engage in a fight for the first time, 95% of the time, I get jacked, hard.  By the way second easist difficulty name escapes me.  The mechanics of this game are amazingly unforgiving.  Yes yes, youtube videos, walk throughs on character develpment, blahblahblah.  I love watching youtube videos of people with 45 strength or 50 finesse when I have 15 and maxxed out all I could.  I expect a challenge when I fight.  I don't expect to try moving the coffins over here and lead this one guy out alone, or telekinesis this over there to build a wall to prevent mobs that I have no previous knowledge of them being there in the first place.  Sun Tzu would have killed to have the preknowledge it takes to win some fights in this game.  I hear plenty of talk about how this is a herald back to the old gold box D&D games, or a reminder of how it used to be in D&D with a DM reading off the descriptions for the module some of us were playing on a Saturday night.  DM never let us look at the notes and see where the monsters were hanging, and what their hit points were.  At least, mine didn't.  Yours?  Battle won after the third youtube video watched, 2nd or 3rd hour reloading the game, treasure collected.  It seems... hollow.  Onto the next series of saving - reloading.

It is 2017... And mods will block Achivments...!  REALLY?! In this day and age, mods will block achivments?   ******************************************** So, the first issue at hand: The Duality mindset of modding. This game have a healthy modding comunity out of the gate, and it will probably only get better with more talanted people going into this game. But... WHY DOES THIS BLOCK ACHIVMENTS?! It isn't like a big deal, I know that! Most of the achivments are mostly just to do certain task in a certain way, or jsut get to a certain ponit regardless of which path you took to get to the same goal.  But WHY is there system in place that basicly tells you ""NO! You shouldn't mod!"" --------------------- Because... despite how good this game is, there are some flaws with this game. --------------------- Some are subjective, like the balancing, but some are objective such as UI elements. Why try to dictate how any player should play their single player game?  I have been playing, and I am getting very frustrated on every... single... item... you pick up goes to the action bar. THE ACTION BAR IS A MESS AND A CONSTANT ♥♥♥♥ING SOURCE OF ANOYANCE!  Here is an analogy: It's like, you clean your houes. You go about your day for an hour. And suddenly the houes is in the same vrecked state as you began with. :(  There are mods that limit what items get automaticly added to the action bar. They do not make enemies weaker... It doesn't make you stronger... All it does... is make a more enjoyable experience where you can focus more on the game, and not being a bloddy maid and keep cleaning your action bar every 5 steps in the game.   A mod that would make the game just objectivley more enoyable for us that wish to use it, can not be used. Because it would dissable achivments... ******************************************** Inbalanced mods:  And... let say you DO wanna play with a mod that changes game balance?  ... It is a single player game with co-op elements. Why not let people play as a god charachter if they want to? I don't want to... but I see NO reason as to why a person shouldn't be able to do as they wish!  Did anyone ever say in Skyrim; ""Man! I wish they would block achivments! Because if some random♥♥♥♥♥player wanted to put Randy Savage into the game as a dragon. That would make achivments pointless!"" ********************************************  ... I got nothing more to say! I mean, can anyone say anything more after using Randy Savage as a dragon, as a argument?  I rest my case!  So go ahead, do get the game! Because it is great!

734,Aphex,120,2,0,"November 15, 2017",Not Recommended,98.8,I prefer the first game. Magic/Armor-System ruined the game for me and was propably implemented to balance multiplayer/pvp.  Using skills is pointless because by the time they would do anything other than damage you might as well finish off the enemy. This makes combat super boring due to lack of tactics and forgett about using the environmental effects like in OS:1....enemies will just walk through them. The exessive use of verticality and the spread of enemies only add to that issue and make aoe spells useless. Mages simply suck. Magic armor makes enemies immune to all spell-cc and phys.-armor makes them immune to phys.-cc. Going either full phys or magic team is the way to go.  Oh did i mention that you are limited to 6ap total now? Stupid descision and clearly another attempt to balance pvp.  Itemisation is ♥♥♥♥ed. Scaling is ridiculous. People ended up defeating the end boss in one turn due to terrible balancing. Using warfare is mandatory for ALL physical charakters including archers due to damage multiplication. Cross character combos are non existant. Game is a dumbed down mess.  In conclusion: Poorly implemented new systems that are outright unnesscesary. Why fix what isn't broken?  The camera/environment doesn't help either because something is constantly blocking your view.  Overall rating: Monumental dissapointment. Buy the first game instead and then forget about the series.

Divinity Original Sin was a masterpiece most games could only dream of emulating, and sadly, this sequel failed.

Step 4: Lose fight after 13 minutes. Step 5: Realise you didn't save before your previous attempt, which had really good positioning. Step 6: Win fight after an hour total. Step 7: Get into a fight with the next group of enemies.  I gave this heap of smeg multiple attempts. Eventually I gave up out of frustration and boredom after reloading a single fight 8 times in Act 2.  Recently, I tried the Definitive Edition with two friends, and it started off well; We were all having a good time. However, as soon as we stopped fooling around - murdering every NPC in Fort Joy - and tried to progress, we came up against a fight that killed the fun. A fight that, despite our being level 6 from our rampage, gave us a game over four times, each after an agonizingly long run.  In these runs, I saw every design decision and bit of balance that made me resent the original game left perfectly intact. For instance, the ""decaying"" status effect is horrendously designed. With little visual indication, it's all too easy to accidentally kill yourself while trying to heal, and there are very many enemies that are capable of inflicting it on you. In addition, magic is still comically weak compared to physical damage. Why bother with it when everybody has their own elemental resistances? Even when an enemy has higher physical armour, just wailing on them will invariably kill them faster than trying to whittle down their magical armour.   While I am by no means averse to difficult games, this game's difficulty mixes with it's slow pacing like orange juice and toothpaste.   As for the armour system, I cannot dump hard enough on it. In most games, armour reduces the amount of HP damage you take from certain types of attack. This is fine. In others, armour is instead a seperate bar that has to be emptied before HP damage is dealt. This is also fine. What isn't fine, however, is having two seperate bars for physical defense and magical defense. It only serves to punish you for trying to mix up your strategy. It means that your wizards can't soften up an enemy for the knight, unless you spend a long time emptying both the enemy's physical and magical armour, but why would you take the time to do that? A far more sensible system would be a single armour bar with a sliding scale of whether it takes more damage from magic or from physical attacks. But that's too much like good game design to be in this. Imagine if you were playing DOOM and every enemy had a seperate HP bar for every weapon you have. I can honestly say that the DOS2 armour system is one of the most poorly designed mechanics I have encountered in any game I've played, and I've played some garbage.  It's a poorly balanced and poorly designed slog. You're dissuaded from mixing magical and physical damage by the core mechanics: In order to HP damage, you first off have to empty your target's respective magical armour or physical armour bar. The story is uninteresting, featuring a bland doomsday antagonist. On the bright side, it's impossible to get truly angry at the difficulty because you'll be too bored to be angry!  I sincerely wanted to enjoy this game, but every single time I found myself thinking ""I am not having fun, why am I trying to deny this?"""

Looked into it and basically had to resort to youtube and walk throughs in order to find things out which isnt what I paid for. Early combat is heavily squed to the side of the game and difficulty isnt really shifted in the right way imo. The main thing that was annoying was that the difficulty mod was a hard lesson as the intro level on the ship is long and boring after the first time you play through it.  I also have some heavy critisism for the enrionmental aspects of the combats. I understand that the creators were trying to have a heavy focus on positioning and AoE aspects of the game but litterally every fight has some kind of zone or area that will suddenly make the battle one sided, even oil throwing crocks for some odd reason that will ignite a torch nearby and nuke half the screen. Like I get it, you wanted something more than hack and slash and you wanted a cool new aspect to the rpg experience but every single freaking fight doesnt have to have archers shooting firebombs or fire cocktails or poison containers.   Camera controls are ♥♥♥♥ and need a serious overhaul imo too. you can spin but there is no pitch and in order to see half the time i feel like i had to blind click into areas.

Most people will actually enjoy and remember the 1 or 2  rather op powers they got at some point in the game and completely forget all the other boring mediocre powers that didn't mean anything for the gameplay! This has always been true, but it began to be forgotten by the developers since when MMORPGs became a thing, because at that point games weren't single player only anymore and players didn't like that some classes could be stronger than others or that some powers were op and could one-shot them.

Every fight is ridiculously hard, the AI even in the lowest difficulty is way too smart, and when I say way too smart I mean like 500 IQ. On my normal difficulty play through the AI has many times, attacked their own teammates to heal or remove a status effect, Placed their character perfectly against a wall/barrel/lamp/other player too avoid backstabs, but almost every turn the enemy AI will move just outside of your attack range. THIS IS NORMAL DIFFICULTY. This is one of my biggest issues with the game not to mention the fact that if you stumble onto enemies one or two levels higher then you, you basically lose instantly.   The second issue is this game was named wrong, Divinity: Original Sin 2? Nah more like teleportation gloves the game. Its like the entire ♥♥♥♥ing game revolves around this pair of gloves. From beginning to end these gloves are always there being used in one way or another.  Half the time Im playing this game im walking around aimlessly trying to find a fight I can win or looking for some way to teleport across or to somthing.  Edit: Positive things about the game I forgot to mention because I was on a rant  The dialouge in this game is very good, along with the origin stories for your companions are very rich and take you to strange places.  The abilities are really cool, wether you are a trying to be a powerful mage or a strong melee character you are given a vast variety of abilites to shape your characters.  As I mentioned the AI is very hard so if you're looking for some challenge this is right up your alley  And to anyone who thinks this game isn't hard and the statement is laughable you are wrong. The game gives you a warning about the combat before you start and here's a statement from the store page saying the AI is hard ""beware - the game’s AI 2.0 is our most devious invention to date""  All in all I give this game 3/5"

Want to get a heads up on not wasting your time for first few days of playing this crap? Spend hours watching videos to learn the game cause thats only way, else just waste a lot of time in trial and error.   Forget the typical group, mage, tank, healer, rogue. Thats a recipe for death and frustration. It is NOT the base premise for balance in this idiotic game, which is why its so frustrating. People who make games to look like an RPG, then deliver this diablo crap should be called out for it.   And yes I am saying it, Diablo 3 was crap and so is this. So on my 3rd start after wasting alot of time watching build videos I still get wiped easily. Why? Dunno my tanks have some magic armor on their gear but none when fight starts. Why? Who knows and I am not gonna waste more time figuring that out. Most of the fights are big set pieces designed to  wipe your group or drain you of res scrolls etc. Its same thing every fight but the mobs look different.  The people liking this crap must be diablo 3 lovers cause this is not an RPG and not much like DOS 1. It appears, at least the early game, to be balanced around players who know all the skills and spells ahead of time. Who know going in what they are up against. Thats great for the people who played this in early access or some such, but if you are walking into this cold, get ready to a ton of frustration.

I should point out that difficulty isn't dynamic or interesting, it's just monsters with scaled up HP/armor/damage, so fights just take longer, not become more interesting.  Story is ok but is miserably slow, intro is incredibly boring, you spend a good chunk of the early game in a ""who cares?"" mode because nothing interesting or compelling is happening.  It improves later on, though.  The only thing worse is the fanbase, which is full of ""git gud"" elitists who can't stop jerking the devs (and each other) off long enough to get over their fanboyism and admit this isn't that fun."

If you like your camera angles to make sense and for the user interface to be easy to grasp then this probably wont be a game you'll enjoy. So far I've played a tiny bit, and I know people will give me trouble for not playing very long but If within the small amount that I have played I still have no idea what's going on or what  I'm supposed to be doing that's kind of an issue. I enjoy the non hand holding to an extent but when There's no indication of anything I'm supposed to do, there's a problem.  Maybe I do need to play a bit more, but the camera's finnicky and often weird movement style makes it incredably hard to get your bearings and doesn't make me want to play to understand it. If you're looking to try it out and think that 2-3 hours is enough to know if you'll want a refund or not then I have bad news for you, It'll take about that long just to get a grasp of properly moving the camera around.

I can't even think of a similarly styled game that didn't utilize edge of screen orientation in the last 20 years. What is this, 1991? Having to use the home and delete keys to look around severely impedes immersion. Furthermore, it doesn't zoom out enough.  - No option to always run. In all the games I've played over the years, there was never a time where I wanted the avatar to just ""mozey"" to the desired destination. And because the camera is so claustrophobic, you have to click near the edge of the viewport to initiate the run sequence, even though you may not wish to run all the way to the edge.  It's akward and un-natural, and that destroys any chance for immersion for me personally. I'm going to try for a refund.  As for the story so far, it's cliche to the point of agitating. You start off in bondage. Have to escape. Whoah side quest go backwards and rescue poor helpless people. Yada yada. That's 8 out of 10 story lines.

Real Thoughts on stand out issues - After playing some more, the game is beyond linear to my PoV. The story starts and is oddly dull but the combat is somewhat cool, never have been a fan of turn based games but this one has at least some features that make it stand out. I understand this is a die hard D&D Game but everything feels like you've either done all the events correctly in this one specific order or you've been punished. The first area not being the ship but the island is a major turn off. Nothing was really impressive, your choices of things to say to everyone seemed limited and always ended up making everyone attack you if you didn't choose the correct script. That is easily the biggest issue IMO about this game. For people who are very story driven and love punishment for trying to do your own thing, this is your game. Movement is awful trying to click and move you always steal something from someone and the town again hates you, selection is buggy and has a mind of it's own, smaller things but they grow on you quickly. Trying to quest without looking everything up is also a problem. I spend more time reading the wiki page because the quest journal is lengthy like this stupid review im writing.

804,Jim0bhab,19,2,4,September 10,Not Recommended,27.3,"Possibly the single worst experience I've ever had playing a video game.  The story is bland, uninspired, and borderline incoherent. The player is expected to have background knowledge of the game's premise prior to actually starting the story. In trying to learn what the hell was going on, I actually had to pull out my phone to consult various ""fandom"" websites to even get a hint as to what the story might actually be. Didn't even try to figure out some of the more miniscule details of the plot, less I get an aneurysm.  The writing is awkward, amateurish at best and comes off as stilted/pretentious. Dialouge choices have almost always the same outcome. The most crucial decision making often results in what can be described as a ""yes/no"" response. Even bothering to waste your time conversing with characters seems to be a blatant waste of time in the long run.  Character modeling and development is laughable. Characters often end up unimportant mary-sues with the same face and clothing. Those who aren't reused assets try way too hard to be unique, resulting in characters so aggravating that they're better left off dead than alive. I've seen better character creation options in Final Fantasy I. Final Fantasy I characters are also more expressive, even though they're pixelated.  The voice acting is masterful. That being said, it seems the entiriety of the game is voiced by about four people. Even characters physically next to each other often have the same voice actors. The narrator of the game helps to destroy any immersion and often serves as an effective deterrent against players, who might conscientiously decide not to do certain things lest they trigger this bastard's voice lines.  The gameplay is standard at best. Turn-based combat that while polished, brings absolutley nothing new or imaginative to the table. Generic armor, combat, and magic scaling that encourages anything but a ""diverse"" playstyle. The combat has about as much ""depth"" as some old school NES games did. Difficulty is widely adjustable. Inventory management is simple and uncomplicated. Crafting system might as well not exist. Attempting to play multiplayer results in a kick from a disgruntled host.  The game has little to no bugs. The game will occasionally crash at startup, but this is a minor setback that can be overcome by restarting the client. The game's collision detection and geometry is top-notch. Physics, particles, and graphics overall are pretty. Game is well-optimized. Color pallettes are appropriate and are able to adequatley set the mood for various landscapes. The landscapes of the game although, are about as uninspired as the game's characters, dialouge, combat and story.  The developers are unable to take criticism, going so far as to harass people on message boards for simply not liking their game. The developers do release new patches and content over time however, most of what is currently being added and fixed arguably should've been implemented in the game when it debuted. Error reporting is present and comes off as unintrusive.  The game is compatible with steam workshop mods, which is a big plus in my book.  Overall I could not reccommend this game to anyone and I feel as though the game shouldn't even be considered for play, even if it was free.

Early on you kill an opressive prison bigshot and his gang (which is, incidentally, about half the civilian population of the starting village). The guy supposedly held the settlement in an iron grip by controlling distribution of food.   What changes after his death? Nothing. Literally nothing. Not even a single comment from the liberated, except one line from the quest giver. Guards continue to patrol the corpse-stewn yard, wading through actual pools of blood.    At this point I'd like to remind you that we are discussing a game universally praised for its systemic approach and reactivity.  I rest my case.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Yeah, no.   - The worldbuilding is painfully uninspiring - The fabled reactivity amounts to a couple of cosmetic dialog options here and there plus several gimmicks (stealing faces, talking to cows, putting out fire with water) - Biggest problem: it is a game about turn-based combat where combat means yawn-inducing ability spam and camera wrestling - The graphics are nice, I guess   It's the first Dragon Age all over again, minus cringey romance plus less interesting fights. Can't believe I'm saying this, but even the current crop of faux-Infinity RPGs is better.   Then again, maybe I'm just getting old."

No prompts to ask you if you actually wanna do an action, no instruction that you probably shouldn't be clicking on things unless you plan to die, and apparently there's a sneak mode too which they only tell you about after you steal something. At least in DND you get to say ""I steal the book off the pedastal!"" I mean even RuneScape has a pop up menu so you can choose what you wanna do.  In response to someone telling me to right click:  I mean, left clicking being steal by default is stupid. I figured out right clicking it works now so I can actually read it but after going into the next area I died again because apparently even if you sneak properly and steal something without anyone noticing it leaves a ""crime scene"" behind that basically means they'll just say you look like a thief then kill you. And of course the game only tells you that AFTER you steal something.  Not only that but the game keeps breaking. It broke multiple times in character creation so I had to restart over and over and then in a battle against the person I stole from the game broke again. It was the enemy's turn and they were just walking around me then returned to positions a bit away from me but still battle ready then sat there until I closed the game.  The chat system is garbage too. you have to hit enter to open it, enter to send the message, and enter to close it. The whole game is really unintutive. If you go to click on the chat and you accidentally click slightly off the window you end up moving there and that includes through a door into a bunch more guards and in consumes all your action points so you're guaranteed screwed just because of how unintuitive the game is.  Horribly programmed game. Terribly unintuitive in everything.  UPDATE: I tried stealing the item again(without having to read the tool tip this time). I even went ahead and hid the item somewhere else then when I came back since there was a crime scene the girl wanted to search me so I allowed it. After allowing the search and her finding nothing she basically just says ""well you still look suspicious so I'm gonna kill you."" Like... what? So basically you can do everything perfectly in this game and people will still kill you for no reason. I mean why don't they just kill the other guards too then and everyone on the ship? Still a terrible game.  UPDATE: So I tried playing through the game without stealing things and upon getting to Magistar Williams just a few rooms over after the whole thing there I tried talking to someone and it won't let me choose options any more.

Even the fact you can get skills at later levels is something you'll have to guess or look up the internet before playing, otherwise you make choices without having nay idea what they entail. The difficulty is set in such a way that you more or less have to do everything in a certain order. If you skip stuff, you'll be too low level to beat that important enemy so I don't feel the freedom I would expect from this title. Combat is very boring imo. Most of your abilities are unusable until you have depleted your enemy of their armor, at which point you're better finishing them off, so all your control abilities are next to useless. The system also encourages each and every of your characters to be spread between physical and magical. Should you specialise a character, you'll be penalised for it.

Let me start off be saying be ware this game has NO quest log or min map markers, you are pretty much stuck in this big area with only vague glues or ideas on where you MIGHT go... As far as the combat side goes it's almost pain full to fight. You alwas feel out number and moving around during a fight is like pulling teeth. I would not recomend this any one unless you are a HARDCORE rpg player.  I would also like to sight another clear down side to this game (for me) I discovered today. Once a group of enemies is killed there is no respawn for them, witch basically means you will never be able to grind for levels and gear. I guess this is ok if your just playing to hear a story but if your farmer and enjoy grinding you will be sadly let down.  I am leaving this review up and not changing a thing, alot of people who knew what they where buying and are fans of the DOS series have had some pretty harsh criticisms on my review witch is fine.  About a dozen people have flamed me for not doing enough resreach about the game, honestly when I did read steam reviews about the game  along with a couple sights including ING and Gamestop, I never found one that mentioned any of these  qualities.

You are offered many choices, though you have only one right answer.  Ordinary animals all have exotic and jarring magic powers that make no sense. Alligators, despite what you might expect, have the ability to teleport other and summon powerful meteors from the heavens. Probably other powers too, but I wasn't strong enough to fight them. Other creatures all seemingly have these exotic and nonsensical abilities, though I wasn't strong enough to fight them either.  The characters aren't really all that interseting or likeable. One of them attacks you, and you're given the option of being a total ♥♥♥♥♥, or fighting and killing her. I killed her. She dead, there goes one of the main characters. Oh, and you need her in order to progress, as the game expects you to have her, or you aren't strong enough to tackle encounters, so I guess that's game over.  I liked the first one, and I wanted to like this one. It too had the open world can go where you please, as you please, but you have to do fights in this specific order, and win through this specific strat. While not my favor, it wasn't a deal breaker.  What was a deal breaker was the animals having such insanely powerful magic. It just broke immersion completely. I don't understand how alligators can summon your party members to them and then drop meteors on them. These were not gator-men, ancient wizards from a lost age or anything. Just random lizards on the shore. Oher monsters were all the same. It completely ruined my suspension of disbelief."
848,Spud the Spud,215,6,1,"September 15, 2017",Not Recommended,5.4,"I'm pretty disappointed so far.  I spent over an hour dealing with an odd crash to desktop bug when trying to open the options menu. Not awesome.  Party size is 4. But you can only create one from the ground up, having to take what they give you for the remainder (select 1 of 4 preset options each). I find that they're not built the way I like, with starting talents and skills. Anyway, putting together a party from the available classes feels awkward, clunky, unpleasant, and unable to fill out the party in a manner I'd like with less than 5 (or two built from scratch, as with the first game).  Wasn't a cheap game, so I suppose I'll keep playing and trying to make it work, after starting over from scratch to try to compensate for the party with the one character I can fully design. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bought the game, it's a waste of my gaming budget. Thus far, it's nowhere near as fantastic as the first game was, and I'm completely disappointed. Hopefully it'll get better later, but it's off to a rough start and I'm not optimistic.  First game was incredible. This one has yet to impress me in any way.  Edit: Gave it another hour. Still bad. Had I not been stuck with that crash bug, and the solo mission (in other words, the waste of time stuff before being able to start assembling a group and experiencing how bad this game is) I would have refunded this game.  0/10. That's as a long time lover of RPGs. This is garbage. I wouldn't, knowing what I know now, buy it on sale for even one dollar. Incidentally, I have 82 hours played with the first game."

The default RNPC skills on level are very bad, and that handicaps the early game - though, of course that ends up being less of a bother around the time you get out of the first non-tutorial area (Fort Joy).  Because of the heavy RNG in the loot aspect of the game, there's no reliable way to get good enough gear to handle all the various shenanigans that the enemies will throw at you - and, on hard or ironman mode, they'll throw a lot of shenanigans your way.  But then suddenly you'll gear up and combats will swing hugely and go from either interesting or too hard (so much RNG reliance! If I wanted to play XCOM I'd just play that, thanks) to boring or too easy.  Backed this game on Kickstarter for the CE because of how much I enjoyed the first D:OS game; put 80-90 hours in the first one, co-op, plus another 50+ single-player.

Every button seems grey'd out, but I guess that's just the design? Took me a few minutes to figure that out. I had to make a profile to make a character. Not really sure what that was about. Character design was pretty good. Lot of options, at least. You can make your own character or play as a sort-of Hero. Made an custom Elven Ranger.  Get into the game, click through the first sort-of cutscene and play around with the controls. Talk to the person, they tell me to talk to someone else. No objective, it seems like. Just kinda figure it out yourself. Whatever, I've played games like that before. Go to talk to someone else, for some reason I kick them in the face. No clue why. Eventually find my way to the end. Magic fire stuff happens. I get to the top of the ship. It says run to the life boat so I do. Says I can't get in. Spider thing traps me and kills me. Guess I have to kill spiders. Loot some stuff, kill spiders, get on life boat. Get told their may be people trapped. ♥♥♥♥ that, let's get out of here.  Now I'm on a beach. I find a bow, recruit the Red Prince, and accidently shoot him the face. Go to some gates, some people blow some lizardwoman up, I eat her body to get a memory of some dude who escaped. Then I realized the Red Prince was still at the rock I met him at. He just decided not to follow me, I guess. I walk around, find Fane the undead dude. Walk around more, meet some turtles who try to kill me. The Red Prince decided to stop following me again, so it's just me and Fane. Kill them, loot their stuff. Go to city, meet some people, do some missions, get told about an underground tunnel. go to tunnel, but it's 'guarded' by a ghoul or something. He wipes me twice. He's undead, so he gets healed by poison. All my attacks are poison. One the last attempt, 3 of my guys die, I only have 2 ressurection scrolls. Sorry Lone Wolf. Go to cave, fire slugs want to talk to me, I can't understand them, they attack me. I accidently shoot and kill the Red Prince and quit the game and request refund.  ---  I'm usually pretty decent at games, and can figure out how to play pretty quickly. I mean, I've been playing video games since I was 5. This game, though, is overly complicated to the point of insanity. You have to micromanage everything, and sometimes the game just throws a curveball at you you'll never expect. Like why is my left click suddenly attack instead of walk, or vice versa? I don't know and it doesn't explain it. An Assassin comes up looking for the Red Prince and wipes your party in two turns? Cool, why not. Party member decides not to move and you get in a fight with one party member 200 yards away? Yeah, that's a thing. It just doesn't make sense.  There are positives. The combat, when it works, is pretty good. It's solid turn based combat. It is kinda infuriating when you try to shoot an enemy and your character, for no real reason, decides to walk towards them through fire and poison, but apparently you have to deal with that. Loot make sense, even if it isn't explained very well. The crafting is cool and doesn't seem to have any negatives. The trading is pretty cool. Instead of saying ""Item X costs 40g"" it's ""Item X is worth 40g"". You can offer your own items and gold to buy it. If you want to buy boots worth 5g, you can offer up a 3g book and  2g to buy it. If you offer, say, a 10g book for it, the merchant will like you more. Pretty cool.  Overall, I can't recommend the game. It's just way too complicated. Not for the sake of fun, it seems, but just for the sake of making the game harder. I'm all for hard games, but this one doesn't make any sense. Dark Souls, for instance, doesn't just change on you in the middle of a fight. This does, and I can not stand that. In the two hours I played, I did not get a single moment of enjoyment out of it"

There are some simple bugs STILL in this game. For example, when your party members are separated far apart and/or on completely different maps, you can still share inventory items with them as if they were right there next to you! Another bug is that sometimes main characters in the story act as if they've never seen you before, when you in fact have met them many times. Add to that the sometimes extreme difficulty finding even the simplest tools (such as a shovel) needed to complete the story, and very little guidance in the game for how to create and acquire better items other than a stick with a nail on it, or twigs and string for a bow, and you got yourelf a game not nearly worth the money you paid for it!

I'm not sure why that's the case, but I'm going to assume Larian Studios thought it would be better to reinvent the wheel instead of implimenting a feature from an old game into what appears to be the same exact engine (just more aesthetically pleasing).  On that note, the Larian Studios has been largely unresponsive to inquiries on a local splitscreen feature for months.  ----------------------------------------------------  UPDATE:  I'm aware they intend to implement controller support and splitscreen coop functionality to their game.  They're not giving us updates as to when to expect that.  I am rating it negatively because it currently doesn't support it.  Their assets are prettier, their menus are probably more intuitive, but the engine is largely the same.  It certainly shouldn't warrant having to wait this long for controller support, even as an Early Access game.  I bought (and got a refund) for this game because I assumed it would have these features.  I mean, this game uses the same engine they refined to support this.  I don't buy into the whole, ""We'd have to keep fixing it after every update"" or ""We just don't have the time.""    I just want them to say, ""We decided to waste time and resources to rebuild a new engine that does exactly the same stuff. (Reinvent the wheel)""  Don't get me wrong, I fully intend to purchase this game when it has these features.  Besides, it's not like I can't just change the review when splitscreen coop and controller support is implemented.

Every fight you get in will go like this: You take 1 turn on a char, the enemy all take 2, you take another turn on a different party member, the enemy all take 2. AOE everywhere, everything casts decay, you hover over an enemy, confirm that tooltip is an enemy, cast spell and it hits your ally. The difficulty changes make little sense, even the difference between the lowest and next highest for settings has issues from being far too easy to being 2 shotted. Line of Sight doesn't always apply to the AI, even for direct attacks. The game is more about wasting your time than gameplay.  This game is majorly flawed in it's actual design.  To put it in a better perspective, since steam has the dumbest version of ""yes or no"" reccomendations I would say 6.5/10."

I cant Alt-Tab, CLTR -ALT-Delete, and the only way to respoind is by doing a force shut down of my computer. After rebooting my computer the PC will then persist in going into a seemingly endless repair boot by constantly restarting.

It seems the idea of this game is to simply wander aimlessly, and return to places you got stuck on if you happen accross the item you needed.  Finally, be preparred to talk to every single NPC.

I have not participated in the Kickstarter for this game and only heard about it upon release on Steam.  Full Review: https://www.gatewaytogaming.com/divinity--original-sin-ii.html (Note: Had to remove first two paragraphs due to limitations)  Gameplay Footage (Spoilers of first hour): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEMTem3wiXk  Walking along the shoreline within the first few minutes, it is clear how detailed the environments in the game are. Texture quality is some of the best I have seen for foliage and building detail. Character models have a great look to them (lizards are simple gorgeous), but armor quality appears blurry at times, ranging from shimmering to ""still rendering"" dull. The way characters move in combat is another story though, sporting some great attack animations. Spell animations highlight the superior usage of particle effects, especially with the way the pyrotechnics and surface changes from spells were taken into account. Just a quick note on the sound department; music is great, if not a bit bland, but it does help fill the void left by the lack of voice-acting. Ambient sounds is decent, nothing special, but it gets the job done. Damp caves, lush jungles, and decrepit forts are all rendered well and are beautifully crafted set pieces for the possible battles some poorly chosen words inevitably initiate.   While the possibility to avoid battles is high due to a wide selection of dialog opportunities, it is not entirely avoidable. Everything is controlled by the use of actions points that replenish each turn or by the use of certain abilities. Movement, skills (with added cool downs), items, and looting all require these points and can cause the player to either horde AP for a future turn if they so desire. Equipment also dictates how much magic armor or armor on goes into battle with, soaking up blows from spells and attacks respectably before losing health. One system in particular that stands out is the environmental status effects such as frozen, stunned, or petrified. Stun multiple enemies by casting Rain and using a shock ability or cast hail to freeze an area that becomes prone to slipping (knocked down). It is a simple idea that makes battles even more tactical and much easier given the surprising difficulty of some of the fights.  While I managed to steamroll through my second playthrough on Exploration Mode, the Classic Mode does offer a couple of difficult fights. Part of this issue could stem from the extremely powerful starter abilities and the relative health amount from certain enemies. One spell was powerful enough (in both power and distance) to allow me to farm tougher opponents without entering combat. I ended up murdering everyone in Fort Joy without dying due to this spell and only found death once at the hand of the final boss. This also allowed me to complete the first Act on Classic in 7 hours while also completing plenty of side content (again, side-stepping by the use of this particular skill). It feels like an exploit to use this skill, but with some spell balancing and enemy distance detection fixes it might not be much of an issue. Outside of this, the final boss is tough as nails and there are plenty of scenarios with ""instant death"" outcomes. It is a challenging experience, but thankfully certain dialog options can side-step combat while introducing new story material.  Dialog plays a definitive role and results can vary depending on plenty of pre-requisites. Certain people will refuse to talk to lizards while others will not provide information unless a specific tag is used. A dwarf in Fort Joy, for instance, reacted positively to one of my party members due to a history they shared and through this conversation an item was produced and some lore was provided. Other cases are just an example of good dialog selection, apparent when dealing with the slugs in the hidden passage or the guard you meet further down the line. Persuasion also helps to deter tense scenarios, relying on stat warfare (stat >=< opponent stat) + persuasion to determine the outcome. All of these dialog routes add multiple ways to deter combat and benefit the roleplaying options already provided by the game's darker tone. It essentially made my second playthrough (this time on Exploration Mode) less reliant on combat, finishing the first Act in five hours.   The story this time around revolves around the Divine being dead and the voidwoken's numbers increasing due to the use of Source magick. As a ""sourcerer,"" the player is taken to Fort Joy to be ""cured"" of their curse, awarded a stylish collar to block the magick. Shipwrecked and alone, the player awakens on the shore and soon discovers the only salvation in sight is inside a camp run by the devout of the departed Lucian. This is the setting of a deeply troubling scenario that mixes an unknown protagonist amidst plenty of mentally scarred individuals and a questionable authority purely on the basis of paranoia. It opens up further as other NPCs join to hopefully escape the unknown consequences of conforming and most of it is well-written, including several side quests that range from disturbing to outright sickening. I have always been a fan of the more macabre settings and enjoyed what was on offer so far. Some of it is cliche, which at this point is hard to avoid, but the overall struggle is one I greatly approve of.  Being in alpha, there is bound to be issues creeping around in the cellar. When climbing vines (specifically the one lowered by someone later on), the current character will climb it normally, but the other party members will not climb it. During combat, the game pauses on the current character (with no AP) and seems to delay a good 10-15 seconds before it moves on to the next person in the rotation. Graphical issues can sneak up as well (helmet hidden removes hair, floating weapons, enemies clipping) as well as the obvious crashes that plague most early access games. Does it excuse it? Of course not.   While none of the following issues are deal breakers, they are quality of life issues that can make the experience rather annoying. Inventory items must be dragged to other slots in order to organize them and the system could really use a auto-sort feature. The camera can be very stingy when trying to zoom out and has a very limited scope that can make moving in some areas absolutely frustrating. There is no real direction in terms of locating the next objective, especially at the beginning. This last point isn't an issue for me (actually found it refreshing), but some areas might require loading a save file (Rex's Castle) due to an inability to leave.   My sword has been pierced into the shoreline of Fort Joy twice with a grand total of 12 hours between both play throughs. I spent a little time testing out the Arena mode on the 4p map to ensure it was functional, but it left a very weak impression on me. The main story felt a bit cliched, but the ominous vibes surrounding the campaign left me intrigued enough to play through it. I loved some of the side quests (never kiss a stranger) and applaud the colorful aesthetic for contrasting the depressing mode without feeling awkward. The bottom line, however, is too thin to support the hefty price tag for what is essentially a demo. I cannot recommend Divinity: Original Sin II at this time. Larian Studios has a successful history with early access and I hope to see how there second time around turns out when I come back to update my review upon full release.   Pros  - Visually impressive - Great combat - Story (what there is of it) is decent with a macabre overtone - Few great side quests   Cons - Content lite  - Crashes - Sound assets need work"

929,OR2008,96,2,14,September 13,Not Recommended,172.5,"Don't get this game.  I spent over 100 hours trying to figure out what to do and I never got off the first Island. Everything in this game is veiled in complexity hidden behind layers of convolution. Nothing in this game is straight forward - which isn't a problem - but the game doesn't explain anything. The wiki is just as bad - which tells me the developers were making this game for a specific audience already familiar with their product, or they themselves created a monster and didn't know how to deal with it so they released it unto the world.  Quest logs are organized haphazardly, on-screen notification don't stay on screen long enough, characters are bland at best and downright annoying at worst. You have to walk around with left alt depressed or you won't be able to see anything. Nothing on screen is viewable and so you might miss that key placed right next to the door on that ship...  What was really annoying for me was that there weren't any dedicated traders in game. You have to remember to barter with everyone you meet since they could have something of value and then remember where they are located because you won't have anywhere near the amount of money you need to buy basic survival items. A little tip: don't spend money on weapons - buy tons of armor and spells.  The combat. Jesus Christ, the combat. It's so bad. The player gets to choose from a dozen or so classes, but don't you dare! Don't even think about choosing a non-magic build. Raw physical damage will get you nowhere. Oh yeah, every enemy has at least 2 health bars, sometimes three: Physical health, armor and magic. Mages will have more magic armor than physical, melee characters will have more physical than magical, so you have to attack each accordingly. At level 7, I have to do upward of 200 freaking damage to kill something. What?! That's insanity. The combat is so convoluted and overly complex. Why do I have to create these exaggerated, synergistic combos to get anywhere? I mean, there are 12, TWELVE! different types of surfaces. Are you serious?! TWELVE? GTFOH! I get that understanding this stuff can be rewarding, but it shouldn't take 100 hours to do that. If a developer wants people to play their game, accessibility has to exist somewhere in the game. In this game, it doesn't exist.  The AI. GD AI! Always focuses on one character - the weakest - and they manage to kill them in 3 turns. My DPS is stupid low compared to enemies that are supposed to be the same level. I'm guessing enemies scale in this game since I never fought anything higher leveled. Scrolls are required to resurrect characters, which you'll be needing tons of btw since healing is so scarce. Enemies seem to have tons of AP. I once had an enemy move halfway across the screen, cast a spell and attack on the same turn. Come on. Nothing about this game's combat system makes sense in a traditional risk/reward system. You're penalized heavily for taking risks and penalized heavily for not deviating from hack n slash. This game wants you to play perfectly. Every. Time.   If you do decide to get this game - first have your head examined, then, seriously, sit the F down and map out the kind of character you want. Everything about the character. I mean EVERYTHING. Look at the skills, the attributes and abilities. EVERYTHING!  Or, just don't get this game. That'd be better."

This game has amazing online reviews that I can only assume after playing it are staged because it is not possible for so many people to have posted reviews that are inaccurate. This means there is serous catfishing involved, the people clicked on the worng game for the review or I'm not in my right mind. While the graphics are nice to look at the interface and playabillity are terrable. Movement is difficult especially out doors. Items are commonly very difficult to see and the tool that was built in to make it easy to see the items (left alt key) while showing some items it does not work for most. The game waypoint system failed. When you reached waypoints and game play paused showing it was saving but no save point was created. It is very difficult to determine who allies are in some combat scenarios. This is just a trainwreck of a game, but wait it gets better. How is this possible you ask..... This game is advertised as multiplayer and as a multiplayer game it is almost unplayable. Typically the software developer will blaim this on your connection quallity, however, in my cast that would be hard to do since the other player and I are both connected on gigabit Fiber internet connections. We for other reasons transfer large files of a secure nature to eachother so there is monitoring software involves that tracks connection quallity and speed as well as verifies it is secure. My reporting shows no issues with connectivity speed or quallity. Moving on... My view of the game as the organizer was fair, but the player I was playing with was dealing with horrific lag, random movements and actions. This is one of only a couple games I have ever owned I wish I had never purchased. I only played for a total of 8 or so hours but according to steam I had just under 53 hours played since purchasing it Saturday afternoon.

(not sure why they have the game set to open in the first place)  Even if you join a game with friendly players you can be left with playing any of the classes at random for a completely unknown amount of time.  I guess my point is the multiplayer in this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ entirely built for trolls.  The single player story is interesting so far, but I am not going to reccomend it due to the terrible multiplayer experience.  I can't see myself playing through the story more than once.  edit:  Lol these comments are crazy.  To the ""play an RPG with randoms people"" Yes I bought the game expecting to play like most other RPGs.  Diablo 3, Path of Exile, even dark souls are all RPGs with multiplayer.  It is not some game breaking idea.  Playing together is like herding cats.  It would be about as hard as getting a DnD group together and much less fun.  No one can play if the host (dm) is not there.  DM can kick and reload games at will.      To the people saying the devs said you should play with friends.  That should be a banner on the main page.  Random multiplayer games are simply not a fun experience.  People should know that.    Please view this game as a solo game or herd all your friends to meet up for an RPG every week.  Edit 2:  For me Steam is simply for buying and launching games.  Ive been on here since the orange box.  If the fact I use steam to play games and not keep a social media game diary makes you want to ignore my opinion then by all means ignore it.    I see that kind of immediate personal attack as a fanboy tactic since you cannot combat the truth in the review.  DOS2 has a terrible public multiplayer system.  If it had normal multiplayer I would see myself playing hundreds of hours, going through the story multiple times on multiple characters, jumping into friends games and playing with them.  Jumping in random games and talking to people and taking a back seat as they take care of (and probably murderhobo) the story.  Instead I will play through the game once more on single player after the release where you are not simply escaping the island to a suddent abrupt end like the alpha.   The single player game is not bad.  Tons of things to do, plenty of side quests, loads of (text based) dialogue which at times was way way too much for simple things.  Easy enough when it comes to stratagies and skills.  Even unexpected feelings, torturing people is one thing, but that poor bear cub :( I tried to revive the mom with a scroll, but couldnt.  I should be able to revive the mom!  Final edit for launch:   The last wave of balancing made the game a lot nicer for single player.  Sadly stealthing really only works well on multi player due to party leashing system.  They should have stolen the solo mode from KOTOR.    If you plan on buying this for a single player story you will probably enjoy it.  If you want hundreds of hours of multiplayer fun and endless replays this game is not for you."

936,emitfudd,23,1,7,"September 28, 2017",Not Recommended,2.9,"I am so confused by all the glowing reviews. I was so excited to play this game and thought this would be something like Skyrim but 10 times better. Here is what I found after playing for just 2 hours.   The camera angle is ridiculous. You are looking down upon your character from around a 45 degree angle. I am constantly trying to look ahead or up but you simply can't. It is like driving a car but you keep getting pulled into the ditch. So frustrating. If you zoom the camera in everthing surrounding your immediate field of view becomes blurry. Zooming out so you can actually see a little bit of what is going on around you makes everything so small. I am playing on a 27 inch monitor and my character is less than an inch tall.   I absolutely hate the combat system. In the first fight the game just took complete control of the fight. I couldn't move. I had no idea what was going on. There is no freedom whatsoever to attack or move freely as you wish.   The narrative is so boring. Every single person you encounter leads to a dialogue and the narrator pops open this huge box right in the middle/top of your screen. I wanted to play a game, not read a book.  I changed my settings for audio/video etc. The next time I started the game they had all reverted back to the default settings.   I can't believe that so many people are claiming this to be the best RPG of the decade. I have played Skyrim, Fallout 4, Dragon age inquisition and loved them all. I simply can't play this game. I have asked Steam for a refund.   "

Playing this game is like reading a book, except it's sluggish book that you have to stop for a minute every time you turn a page.  I run up, talk to an NPC spend 5 mins picking/reading all choices , he tells me what to do, I spin around to head towards objective, have to adjust camera cause I cant see the door(half the time my view is obstructed by a wall or structure), and  once I can see the door, I awkwardly walk/run as the movement feels glitchy as my character randomly stops/starts running, and I try to get him through the door.

958,Shujin,21,7,22,"September 16, 2017",Not Recommended,32.1,"Would not recommend this game. Most boring RPG I have ever played.  Played with 3 friends and it took 2 hours of game time to even get out of the intro and get to the first city so there goes my chance for a refund before the game even starts.  Combat is painfully slow playing with 4 people and the story was excruciatingly boring.  Sometimes combat was 3 or more hours between and I was struggling to stay awake, the only reason i continued to play was because it was coop and I could play with some friends.  One of my friends increased the difficulty from normal to hard and the rest of the time playing after that was spent strategically avoiding combat because it was too difficult for our team or we were severely outnumbered and would be wiped out in a single round.  We attempted to change it back to a more suitable difficulty so we could participate in combat more often, but apparently we could only change the difficulty once and now we are stuck in a role-playing game too afraid to get in to combat or be faced with instant death.  The graphics were nice, the spell effects were decent and I even liked the landscape - unfortunately it takes much more than that to make the game enjoyable and my experience with divinity was so unbearable I spent most of my time in the game watching movies while my team scolded me in discord for getting lost, falling behind and dying to traps.  A majority of the time playing was spent mindlessly following my team until we eventually got to a boss fight (which were so far and few inbetween it wasn't worth the wait). It wouldn't have been so bad if the follow feature wasn't disabled in coop so I could have just auto-followed them until combat started.  The jokes were lame and there was nothing comedic or funny about anything they said.   As far as I'm concerned this is a solo game that you should really play alone and should be played like a book. Expect minimum gameplay unless you enjoy looting worthless items, speaking to boring npcs or just clicking around the map mindlessly navigating areas."

I’ve been playing these types of games for literally 20 years and I’ve never been so outright frustrated and bored at the same time with any game until I ran into this one. If there is a way I could get my money back for this game I would happily do it – and then burn it dollar by dollar. I would’ve had more fun that way.  Yes I have looked at all the YouTube videos on how to min max a character. Yes I have followed all the cheat guides and walk-throughs. Yes I have followed all of the hints and guides on how to get through difficult areas.  Every fight – and I mean every fight – feels like I’m five levels below where I should be even when the characters are equal level to the baddies that I am fighting. I die repeatedly even saving in between each section and step of a fight that I’m taking. If this is how the entire game is supposed to be run in order to even complete getting to Act II – this game needs a serious fix. This is not fun – this is not the way a game is meant to be played.  I’m tired of dying. I’m tired of playing and not getting anywhere for wasting three hours of my life.  I’m tired of not doing enough damage and having them take all of my armor and then half of my life in one hit. Yes by the way I am even doing the stupid stealing from all the merchants and getting the best crap cheat.  Do not ever buy this game – do not ever buy this game on sale – do not ever accept this game as a gift.

All of the fights are too difficult and there are no additional ways for me to get experience to level up to be able to progress through the fights... I can't say I've ever ran into this before.  The fights themselves aren't any fun either. 90% of the fights will go as follows... Your group walks into a fight situation in a tight grouping. The fight starts, the enemies will have the initiative and they will immediate start hitting you with AOE nukes that you can't avoid because your group insists on entering the fight standing two steps apart from each other. There isn't any way to adjust the grouping, initiate the fight with a single member or avoid the AOE.   Playing this game is like repeatedly being forced to walk into a trap you can see coming from a mile away.

990,Glenjamin,220,No,0,June 21,Not Recommended,56.4,this game feels like it was written and designed by a ten year old. every bit of the story feels convoluted and hard to follow every fight even the very beginning ones feel long drawn out and have unecessary mechanics. like why does a salt water crocodile shoot a flaming ball of napalm at me makes no damn sense? randomly one of your companions will go full spastic  and attack someone especially lohse who just decides to channel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s  and attack a rando at the worst possible time. oh and you are basically in rags in the beginning you have to fight groups of 3 to 4 monsters and to top it off the combat system is clunky and always allows friendly fire oh and you can chain elements   but literally none of the combat information is given to you....so you just find out random nonsense. some makes sense like wet and lightning dont mix but the fact one of your companions is healed by poison and its never mentioned and you accidentally kill him is god damn irritating.  on top of this the story is just terrible and hard to follow makes you feel like you have to play the first game no explanation is given of whats going on wtf is source wtf are godwoken wtf are the monsters they summon when they use the source?  i mean its playable but they clearly bought the good reviews they have  because in no way shape or form is this a great game.  oh and healing sucks so you can do fine if you have health potions but again not explained you could probably buy some but the vendors arent marked  their is holding my hand and their is giving me no information at all and telling me to go fly a kite and thats what this game does.  a good concept ruined by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics and random story twists that arent necessary and usually annoy the hell out of you  on top of none sensical enemy mechanics and no real tutorial on how anything works at all.  in short half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥badly thought out game decisions that effectively make this an over priced and over hyped turd.

I was told by friends that this one resolved all the issues of the first, it did not. If anything this one is 5X worse, at minimum.  They say the game has ""tactics"", but the only tactic that works is bugging out the AI so you can isolate enemies and use all 4 of your team vs 1.  Im about 5-7 fights in, and I am completely stuck, i have 3 different fights I can do, but they all result in the same outcome unless i resort to cheese to try and win.  At least the fights in the 1st weren't so 1 sided, and you could have a tactical fight. Even with the other fights I won without being cheezy, i still did not win any humanoid fights without having to reload my game 2 - 3 times, sneak in chars and unchain them into positions. If i wanted to play memory games I would go buy a ♥♥♥♥ing deck of cards.   Wanna kick myself for even trying this at full price.  On the other side a few other cons, the armor looks odd on almost all char models. The char models / portraits look like they were rushed, more like clay statues with no life.  The voice acting is very good, but that so far is the one saving grace, this game needs patches, and the combat needs serious work.

Also, for anyone with the Nvidia Shield TV box and streaming the game to it for 2 player local co-op splitscreen, it works but it doesn't work very well. First player (main controller) controls the screen movement and the splitscreen itself is very cumbersome and flaky (when it actually works) - could do with some serious improvements. It's a good feature though but it falls apart because the game is an RPG, like an old Amiga game with multiple text options in old 1980's style and it just plays awful for the purpose of local co-op splitscreen.

If you a fan of this series, you should pick it up, but for someone looking for a new turn based game, I would not recommend. I'm sure people who love this genre would find this  great game, but for someone like me, who likes all types of games equally, there was nothing in this game that makes it any different to other turn based games.  Pros  - Excellant graphics. - a lot of work has gone into the game. Definatley an A++ title of you like the single player/turn based/baulder's gate style game. - everything appears to be voice acted - fantastic battle mechanics - fantastic environmental system.  Cons - boring story. Nothing exciting or new to the genre. - the quest system was a little confusing. I was left with many unfinished quests when departing each zone. - I found it quite linear. Although it appears open world, there are 4 set zones (which you cant travel between) and within those zones you are kind of forced to do certain parts one by one as each section's NPC's are a certain level.  - I found the character creation a bit confusing.  - no new unique mechanics appear to be introduced to the turn based genre.

There's so much good about it, but at the same time I find it borderline unplayable in areas.  The problem I have with it is similar to Divinity 1.  It is too easy to find yourself locked into absurdly overlevelled areas with no way out other than to load a save.  I spent nearly an hour reloading save after save trying to find a hole to thread the needle of my character.  Then there are the issues with the companions.  Do NOT use a premade character, if you do, then you won't be able to recruit that character, and the only characters you can recruit are the premades.  So if you use a premade character you may find yourself unable to fill your party.   There's a lot of other stuff that is interesting, the combat mechanics are...unique for this kind of game, and I like that.  And I also like the elemental stuff working together, although it becomes a bit too much of a cruch later on, so that it's not some unique trick you pull from time to time, but everything exploding everywhere constantly."
1010,TangoXrayNiner,171,2,11,"December 17, 2017",Not Recommended,96.6,"I cant recommend this game.    The combat is horrifyingly bad.  I mean, terrible.  I mean ugly.  The first encounter was with teleporting croc's who cast spells.  They took out my entire party in 4 turns.  I had 3 people in my group at the time.  I said the wrong thing to a guy named Griff in Fort Murder, my entire party killed in 3 turns.  It only got worse and worse and worse.  WHEN I did win a fight, it was like I lost.  I had to use half or more of my finite resources each fight.  Id get to a bigger, harder fight with nothing to help me.  You level slowly, gain little if nothing in loot, then die horrible over and over and over again.    The only redeeming quality is that the game knows your going to lose every fight, and autosaves before.  EDIT: Im editing this because of some of these comments calling me ""Trash"" or ""New/suck at game"" and want to tell me what I already know.  Divinity was an amazing game and I loved it.  The combats were hard, and could go sideways with a quickness.  That was fun to me, same with games like Pillars and Tyranny.    The biggest problem I have with this game is that the combat system is almost entirely predicated on status effects AKA Knockdown, petrify, atrophy, stunned ETC ETC.  BUT, you cant put those status effects on enemies until you completely remove there Physical or Magical armor.  At later levels, if the enemy goes first, your screwed.  Heck I have a lonewolf group that I put alternating points in Strength and Wits, has a 40+ initiative, never goes first.  Now if you can do enough damage, AND can go first, AND have enough action points you can actually DO something to the bad guys.  If not, your left standing there as they decimate you completely and by the time its your turn, several turns have past because they got through your magic and physical armor and applied turn ending status effects.  I have several groups of characters Ive taken to the first big town, past the Dallis boat fight.  None of them seem to have any chance against certain encounters.  And to the person who commented I just brute force my way through, without doing any sidequests.  Well I just watched a couple walkthroughs and realized that I have been doing nothing BUT sidequests.    I still dont know that I can recommend this game.

AI is ♥♥♥♥ed up. Char progression is not satisfying at all you won’t even need to use most of the stats regardless how you want to play. Also, players are deliberately getting tricked investing into wits where it gives the char +1 initiate and +1% crit chance BUT the game’s initiative order is ♥♥♥♥ed up due to design choices ( I guess) so your initiative stats designed to affect your own party's order. The game always makes sure AI enemy is getting a turn after you.  Another thing is really boring is the ♥♥♥♥ing item progression. I changed 3 rare weapons for same char at the same level. Nothing feels really rare except the collar you wear.   The crafting feature is now ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ever. Because of the console version ( I guess) you get to scroll around 30 different recipes (which all do the same dinner) just to figure out what is what. Same goes for any recipe too. There is no filter menu or good listing feature to see clearly. Lowest tier and highest tier weapons are mixed in the same ‘recipe/ weapons’ section. Thus, looking for something you desire is hard work.  I’m all fine about bugs. None I encountered which breaks the game.  What I’m not OK though is boring combat. I’m 40 hours in and the combats dragging like a lifetime. Yea at first It was all great but now I’m doing the same thing over and over. Nuke the armor, then focus on that opponent. This is repeating over and over. I had that feeling in Pillars after 100hours but in here I got there in 30 hours.

But, like DOS' EE the focus on this game is the superficial and what sophomoric rpg fans want.

You have to manually pan the camera, and/or use the mouse to move, but the camera doesn't follow behind your character like in typical RPGs, but above and at weird angles, so sometimes you can't see where your character is facing, and you have to manually pan the camera to see what's ahead. Graphics themselves don't seem that bad, but the entire game feels like something you would expect maybe five plus years ago. There also isn't any audio/narration to speak of apart from generic background music, so there's a lot of reading in dialogs, like an old Gameboy era RPG. I like the exploratory options available, but....it was impossible for me to really get into the game, and fighting/combat felt weird, even in Explorer mode. I had tutorial mode turned on, but it still took a lot of googling and trial and error to figure out how it's meant to work.  ---  Edit: Came back to the game after Early Access, and I still hold to my previous points about the weird camera and controls. Still, after struggling with it for a while, I kind of got used to it, though it still isn't as immersive as I'm used to. The game itself is kind of addicting in a mindless kind of way (e.g. investigating stuff, choosing the best armor/equipment and skills, etc for tactical purposes).... but somehow it's not really as immersive story-wise as I would like... Still, it's not as bad as it was before; takes some getting used to, but you get used to it after awhile. Some aspects of the controls (e.g. the tactical view/aspect of it) reminds me of Dragon Age Origins, but it's just not as immersive so it's hard to connect with the story/characters. Even when I set auto-zoom on dialog start, the zoom angle is all strange and cuts off part of the character's head.

Some dialog features are missing, probably because it's an early version still. The most major change is probably the new playable races. (thumbs up for the corpse eating elves).  All in all.

So i resisted for a while but finally decided to take the plunge and buy the sequel. This game. And lets just say you cant make a masterpiece twice, It would seem. This is quite the opposite. Different races, bigger landscapes, flashier looking bad guys. But this is where all the trouble is.  you get lost in the linear landscapes. No longer can you freely roam the realms. you can only level up by following the extremely restrictive story, which is hard to follow because of the poor graphics. The combats are more about flashy graphics then any kind of balance. One fight in the arena comes to mind. A simple quest to get you from a - b. every time i start the fight. i get auto blinded in the first turn have to chase all the bad guys up and down ladders barely being able to return fire because blind everytime. we had probability in the first game. And chasing enemies up ladders because it looks nice climbing a ladder doesn't make for a fun game and hardly seems anywhere near as tactical as the first game.

The explorer mode is not making any difference -- the enemies are a bit weaker, but use the same tactics. The whole idea of ""Stunned"" turns the gameplay into a torture - one unfortunate combination of events, and the whole team is tunned while you are watching the nasty movie of AI playing against dummies.

I'll give steam and the developers the benefit of the doubt and hope this game is just terrible because it is early preview...but short of a miracle I'm pretty sure this is not a game that will be any better than the free alternative. I would offer more specifics on potential areas of improvement but honestly...there are too many to even start.  UPDATE: Refund Granted by Steam. Thank you.  WRT to specific issues...I admit it was a very short time that I played the game. But, I was underwhelmed by graphics (possibly related to my hardware), I found the interface less intuitive than alternatives like PoE or WoW, I found myself wandering around with no clear path, stumbled into an encounter and struggled through (lightning touch was too far 2 steps away, fireball blew up around me, couldn't tell if mobs were alive or dead, couldn't tell if I was on fire or not). wandered around some more with encounters with two NPC which I found tedious and boring, and then encountered a red lizard which I couldn't tell whether he wanted to join me or kill me.) I thought it was the latter when next thing I knew he was in my group despite misleading dialouge.  The we wandred into water and I had a textbox with the word WET appear on me which I found borderline pathetic. Honestly, at that point I wanted to jump off that bridge with the drepressed red lizard. So, I decided to cut my losses and request a refund instead. I'm sorry if my initial impression offends anyone and perhaps I may have come to love the game eventually as it matured and I understood the game better. But, I don't have enough game time to play anything less than great (so perhaps my mistake in testing the waters with an alpha game)."

But a few chapters into the game things just turn for the worse more and more.  I have now played 104 hours, reached Arx and I'm done.  Complete disbalance at Tactician. Ridiculous damage output, unreasonable values of armor and magic armor for enemies force you to abuse glitches, savescumming and other questionable tactics. (It turned though in the end - by utilizing clearly disbalanced lone wolf 2h 90% critrate ~300% multiplier build, combat is now too easy [although if for some reason I can't kill half of the enemies in the first turn, I probably die]). All that means combat was for me pretty much♥♥♥♥♥♥in tactician.  Completely ♥♥♥♥ed up initiative system. Initiative values don't mean anything, the order in combat is often arbitrary.   Bugs with you character not having a turn in battle. 50 Initiative? Check. Skipping first turn of combat completely? Check. Happens like every other major bossfight.  Story bugs. My Fane has been on multiple occasions refered to as Lohse in dialogues. Repeating dialogues that you already had. Having dialogue later in the game that completely contradicts one you had earlier, etc.  And the biggest turnoff - puzzles (actually not puzzles, but bad puzzles and poorely designed quests. Arx is a complete disaster in this regard.). I now ♥♥♥♥ed around for 2 hours stuck. Googled the solution - it's finding a painting in some other dungeon and bringing it to a particular spot between two other paintings. Doesn't have anything to do with the story.

It is a very generic isometric RPG, they won, they have my money, but they are not getting any more of my time."

It's exactly that, stats get even more inflated and nothing else that matters is different.  My concrete gripes: Attributes are ARPG level simplistic: pump X for damage, maybe Y if you want more HP for some reason, enough memory to get what you want. Stats get massively inflated between levels, items get obsolete every 30 minutes. Armor system is just dumb, both the split damage resists and the 100%/0% CC prevention. The first game's CC spam was also bad, but there are a lot of better solutions than this thing. Make CC duration get reduced by stats/armor/in general, anything really. Initiative doesn't matter, I go / you go between teams(ok, you could get it on 1 party member). It possible that the game is fun if all you only care about a story and bonking a few baddies on the head. I mostly played the first game for the combat and it was really imbalanced, but fun.

1103,gjhall71,407,No,0,"September 29, 2017",Not Recommended,265.7,"Updated:  After getting  to the final  battle I can say game still needs developed and balanced.  You can tell it was rushed  out. The best act is Reapers Coast (2nd act).  3rd just feels rushed and 4th is  just confusing, unpolished and unless you do things in a certain order - some quests just start / end or aren't available.  Combat: you will always be outgunned, out positioned and enemies will hit you even if you are  not  LOS and seem to  have  a lot more action points.  You can  be charmed, mind dominated, taunted  (which is charmed when it is applied on your guys) in which your charater will use any good consumable and have double the action  points that you would have if you were controlling the char.  Crafting:  A joke.  Unless  a  blade  on a stick  is a good weapon.  The only craftable armor  is some eternal armor (just the chest).  Inventory management is - well it's a game in itself all the components that don't do much.   Ask somebody to post a screen shot of the  ""weapons and armor"" recipes available  - you won't see that screen shot on the game page from the developers.  Plot:  wanted to like it - but it ends up being very dark. if you like to be the hero / good guy - pass  - there are no good guys (seriously).  Want to get  needed experience - have to go around butchering people for experience.  In the end all sides are evil. (no joke).  Interface: cludgy. I find myself having to click on a button 2 or 3 times for it to register.  So when i want to choose a knockdown arrow - better make sure the click took.  Final  battle: LMFAO.  even if you tried to  spread your guys out - the conversation that starts with the end ""bosses"" move all of your characters clustered and surrounded by the enemy to get nuked (all magic armor bye bye in first persons attack) - just for 2nd set of bosses to come on simultaneiously. I think by the time my 2nd person had their turn  (all my guys have 40+  initiative) - 2 were dead.   Not fun. 2 of my guys that died didn't even have a turn yet.   Rez? - nope the other 2 were silenced .   Only thing I look for in a game is a challenge through FAIR game play - not having things stacked against the player like dark souls 2.   Any person that plays  this game will be saving and loading more than any other game.  That should  tell the developers something.   I didn't finish the last battle because at this point the game is just frustrating.  If i could apply true tactics in the last fight -  i would wait until all the bosses (about 12 of them -including  all the ones you beat arleady in the game and last game come back, a huge dragon and insane worm that takes up about 20%  of the screen and vomits previous bosses up) fight it out and come back and fight what is left.

1104,Echoic,284,No,0,"November 14, 2016",Not Recommended,143.3,"I can't neatly describe why I find it boring but I'd say it's mainly the early character development and lack of a coherent character motivation in the early game.  You can choose to have one of 6 backstories or no backstory.  And somehow these backstories seem so thin and formulaic as to be practically irrelevant to the game.  With little motivation to explore the map and a highly generic setting populated by one dimensional characters... this is a recipe for zzzzzzzz.  It's a shame since this is a highly sophisticated and even a unique game in many ways.  After an action packed intro the game proper starts on a gorgeous beach.  You can choose to walk around, and if you like, pick up the shells and detritus.  And you think to yourself... why bother?  For me, this is a feeling that never went away playing Div 2 (though I've only made it up to the end of chapter 2).  Within a minute you meet a talking lizard thing guy who in some very awkward dialogue explains that he is a shipwreck survivor, a former Emperor... ugh.. what else... a fugitive from justice, the sole Red skinned example of his race... a proud and noble warrior or maybe a wizard or anything you want him to be.  At this point I was pretty much certain that this was going to be a boring game.  I don't care if he's Jar Jar Binks, no matter how important and interesting you tell me you are you're only serving to highlight that I've got no emotional connection to anything you say or the world or even any investment in my own character.  So I mechanically criss cross the space completing mini quests in any which way you like, because... that's just what you do in a video game.  Some of the quests were good some are just okay all of them are as familiar as you would expect from a genre fiction setting.  Your character levels up, you learn more about the world.  But somehow there's just no tension at all.  The drama ramps up a little later with talk of all caps GODS, THE UNIVERSE and DOOM.  A hackneyed plot foreshadowing some sort of pick option A through D ending once all the combat is done.  The voice acting was fairly good in parts and the (subject matter aside) written narration verges on great.  But it lacks some sort of spark of excitement or creativity.  That is kinda what I'm hoping for when I invest time in a game.  The combat is complex and something of a mixed bag.   Correct positioning for instance is a crapshoot when most characters can teleport and solid ground can become a flaming oil spill and then an electrical storm in the space of a single turn.  Victory can often come down to whether or not you know before hand what abilities your enemy is likely to use.  All in all I'd give the combat part of this game a grudging recommendation but I've been a long time fan of turn based games.  What I really admire about this game is how sort of 'complete' the game rules are.  Everything that happens in game tends to be consistent within its rule set.  It's not as sophisticated as 2007's Oblivon for example but the game engine is certainly the most excellent part of this game and they even had time to inlcludes cool features like multi and DM'ing... though I couldn't really rate them since I didn't try them."

1107,mysticalyale,128,No,0,"September 24, 2017",Not Recommended,212.3,"I love Divinity original sin. It allowed for freedom and interesting combinations.  The game had its own charm and the flaws in the system ,overpowered/ underpowered abilitys made it fun to play. The areas and creatures you encountered kinda made sense and you knew generally what to expect.  With that said the enhanced edition was released and the game took a turn for the worse becoming an overbalenced borefest.  This is where Divinity original sin 2 comes in. Just like the enhanced edtion it has great graphics, fun original content,etc etc...  but....its just not like the first. It lacks charm.  I will say straight away I have never  played a game more irritating than this one. The enemies are perfect. They are annoyingly perfect in even action they take. It's just silly. The enviroments are cleary fabricated to put you at the disadvantage. There has clearly been too much time put into making sure that you cannot do anything, but be at the disadvantage. Its maddening.  Things I HATE about this game.     1. Every enemy is everything and every ability is the same. What fun is it when fighting a zombie( in a tactical game) and you get out of range of the zombie( tactically) because, its a zombie and you don't want it close, just to end up getting hit with a ""zombie shot"" while the zombie carefully dodges the obstacles in its path, or you end up having him instantly next to you with a ""zombie teleport"" or even worse he runs over and punches his ally to heal his friend. That is not a zombie, why is every creature so tactical? Why even bother with graphics? Its deceptive and makes no sense. I have seen guys hit themselves to hurt my character, just because they knew it would give me some kind of status effect or kill me. I have seen enemies cast shackles of pain on my charactoer and as the last link to the chain formed they stabbed themselves in the heart. It utter rubbish and it is completely out of character. To add to that , every guy seems to have every ability with just a different name. Its boring, even melee characters can teleport around. At least make them look like they are jumping with their ability, not make it look like magic. I thought the characters on the board were supposed to be each special and different. That is why you have 4 characters right? what is this? Gauntlet? Can't hit them close with your axe so you throw axes? Boring. Rubbish.      2. Overpowered and broken status effects. Taking away people's turns and damaging them is a good way to create one way to do things. Why hit someone with a regular attack when you can take away their turn also. ""Hmm. I don't think I will get battle stomp, where I can hit multple people, destory elemental ground and take away turns, Im going to get something more my character like threaten....(I do have to admit I love watching my characters have threaten cast on them, apparently they are so taunted they do ineffective things to the enemy that taunted them, but also manage to do effective things to harm my team, while also using all of my items for no reason. Hmm.. I going to cast this weak fire spell instead of hitting you for 6k a pop... Rubbish) Dealing with staus effects using armor makes little sense. What is the point of battering ram if you can only use it after you have beaten people down? Isnt it a charge??? I mean they are already standing right next to you at this point! One of the most frusterating things about this game is that almost every fight I witness NPCs making choices simply because they A. They knew everything about my character (and they shoud not). (Glass cannon is a good example. They somehow just know you have glass cannon so they ALL target you for status effects. It is absolutely hair pulling annoying.) Or B. They knew the outcome to every possible choice. Either way this makes them very frusterating to fight. Not fun, frusterating. Games are supposed to be fun    3. Overbalenced. The game is so balenced it is boring.It reminds me of playing everquest and then moving over to play EQ 2.  It forces characters to be ""even"" (through loot, class abilites etc etc..) regardless of the choices you make. Don't believe me? Just look at the loot, its clearly designed for flat stat'ers. When was the last time you saw an armor peice designed for a melee character that had incredible characteristics that required a stacked stat such as strength? My warrior has many a point placed into stats that do nothing for me but make it so I can wear the awesome armor that requires intelligence or finesse.. Scale mail with bonuses to intelligence and various spellcasting bonuses, but requires strength to wear....Please point out a piece of armor and prove me wrong.    4. Every enviroment is everything and every enviroment is not your playpen it is their's. Having trouble with a fight? Run away. Make them come to you. If you can...What should be very clear when playing this game is that confrontations are not setup for you to have any advantage. Alot of time and thought has clearly been put into this. In the first game it seemed more of any ""everybodies playground"". In this game it seems that the enviroments were designed to make it more difficult for players, not as a playpen for everyone. We found it so annoying and difficult that my friend and I just engage fights without even talking to people as a general rule of thumb, because they will attack you anyway, after being jerks, then run away and it works well. (What is up with stat checks? I mean 40+ in a stat and you just lose. pfft.)  5. Throw away guys. I hate fighting enemies who are powerful threats to my survival, but when they are killed they seem to be just empty..... First off.. I want to see their character sheet. How did they, being the same level as me become a wizard who bests me in every stat, hp, armor, strength,  etc etc.. who clearly have items. Where are they? Where are all of their items? They must be pretty dang good to make them as powerful as they are. That is what risk and reward are all about. This game ultimately ends up being all just a risk on my part, with little to no payout. I think if there was one point I could drive home to all games it would be this. There has to be risk on both sides at the very least to confirm the realism of your opponent. You cannot roleplay when everyone is just a shadow of a person.  6. Special campiagn characters. I decided to make my own character and use Lohse and the red prince as my others. I spent time gearing them and leveling them up with the stats I wanted for MY TEAM. Only to have toward the end of the game them both leave the group via result of the story. What?!?! Really?? Why would you do that? I get the idea behind the story, but why would you set players up for failure? There is still team oriented game to be played left. Why would you do that? *Shrug* *laugh* Really?.... Now I get to hire some premade character I cannot adjust at this point of the game to fit the role of the character you took away for the storyline. Dont play the premade characters unless they are your main character.  7. Is there anyone on this game that is remotely likeable? I killed EVERYONE and would do it again and again.. so very unlikeable.  8. 85% is 85% to hit. Why does the game make it seem like its 5%?  Aside from all the ranting, it is fairly fun and well made, but it needs some serious tweaks done to it to give it some charm   Play this one only if you have played the first one to death"

Between the campaign, multiplayer, custimization & workshop this game has ALOT to offer. There is one thing however that is quite severe in terms of playing with others that really gets me, and that is the drop-in & out multiplayer. Sure they made due on there promises allowing friends to come and go as they please, however for those that do decide to join in a friends group at a later date for the long haul are in for a treat. Not only do you get treated as a second rate ""dirty npc"" which has zero impact on the story along with few dialogue choices (even with characters you can pick up from the beginning. This also includes the important pvp arena fights which you get auto kicked out.) but in addition any character dialoges that DO come from your character you can't select, leaving it up to other players to pick what YOU say. This essentally gives a similar feeling to the 4 player mod found in div 1, as unless you love reading a novel or fighting a join in player has minimal impact on the game outside of killing everyone.   All & all they did have drop in & out support, I just wish it was more through and well structured then a mod from div 1."
1115,I3LINK,28,No,0,"October 7, 2017",Not Recommended,242.3,"I loved this game when it was released, as well as it's predecessor, and even gave it a raving 10/10 review initially. But after 200+ hours my opinion has somewhat changed, I'll explain. So it's about the combat, which seems to have a lot of depth to it at first, with lots of customisation and potential strategies. But when you take more time to try and get a bit more out of the game and actually put together any form of strategies, you start to realise that combat wise the game doesn't really have so much to offer. For a start let me point out, in case you haven't yet played this installment, how they changed things drastically from DOS1. The armour and shields now indicate whether or not you can inflict status attacks. This completely changes the dynamics of combat, and leaves most battles feeling like a bit of a mess. You see in the first game you could confidently control the flow of combat by knowing who you could inflict status attacks to and plan turns in advanced like a game of chess. Now it feels like inflicting these status attacks comes more down to chance, whether they will be protected or not, and so it becomes difficult to control the flow of combat.  Another problem is that most enemies have some form of teleportation, coupled with their keen prioritisation for attacking your lower health characters. This means that speccing some form of glass canon/mage type of character who sits on the back lines is completely not viable. And I've tried using the Stench talent, but this doesn't lower the chance enough of them attacking your mage unless your mage has near enough the same health as your other characters. What this ultimately means is that all of your characters naturally are required to all have a good amount of armour and shields. The glass canon perk only becomes viable if you can make your character completely untargettable via things like stealth, which is just absurd to create a whole build over. Warriors don't appear to have any real zone of control, so even if the enemy doesn't have teleport they still always manage to walk their way right past your front line. HP/constitution also is completely irrelivent along with certain talents, because any build anticipating to take hits to your HP can easily leave you stun locked by the enemy. This in turn means that necromancer life drain type of builds are pretty much unviable or far too unreliable.  Another problem is the stealth mechanics which are a complete mess and to this day I still don't fully understand how it's supposed to work, or whether they developers even really know themselves. You can chosse to initiate from stealth but then leave your team to fall the the back of the turn qeue putting you at a significant disadvantage, or if you try to leave them in stealth when initiating they unreliably get revealed, it's all just very confusing, and I haven't managed to find a reliable way to benefit from stealth.  Also something I noticed from day one which I was always annoyed about is the lack of diversity in weapon types. I mean a club/mace should deal crushing damage, a sword should cause bleeding, a spear should deal armour piercing, etc... They created all these amazing systems in the game like the bleeding and armour and yet there's no difference between a sword and a mace, there's no incentive to equip one or the other and it just comes down to aesthetic preference. It's a complete oversite and waste of potential and ultimately a let down in what could have otherwise been a great game.  I've really wanted to love this game, the overrall style of the game, the story, characters, the world, it's all really amazing and well done. But the combat is just too much of a mess, and once you realise that there's really not much strategy to be made with the combat then the game starts to feel quite underwhelming. It's funny cause I never really had this problem with the first one, so I think they've ruined what was a perfectly good formula. What they should have done is created a system more similar to XCOM 2, in which case the AI generally prioritises targetting characters which are closest in range, which is due to a higher accuracy. This means you can actually predict who the enemy is going to attack and plan ahead. In XCOM you don't tend to have random enemies who can teleport to your backline, and if so then it's balanced to make it work. In DOS 2 I feel like the developer hasn't balanced these issues correctly and despite how long the game has been released they would have done well to patch these kind of problems by now. Instead they've left the game in a dead state which is unplayable in my opinion. The combat is ultimately very shallow, so apart from some nice story telling I wouldn't expect much depth to the gameplay."

1117,dogmanity,57,No,0,April 14,Not Recommended,61.8,"I've changed my recommendation twice now, but at this point I'm done, and I think my opinion is informed and cooked. This is a good game with a bad UI (mouse and keyboard, or controller) that needs some help that mods can't seem to provide, and a structure that is perfectly opaque and relies on savescumming or wikis to push forward an inch at a time.  First the good: Once you understand combat, the game really opens up. Guides on character builds made this work for me. Once I let go of the urge to play without knowing anything, and bookmarked the wikis, I began to really enjoy myself. I got several hours in and I intended to keep playing. The atmosphere is solid. The voice acting is genuinely good. Big surprise! They spent real energy on building the world.  Then the standard: Game mechanics are fairly convoluted. Unwinnable fights await you in random areas that are apparently ""next"", so save scumming is a must. Without internet guidance, you might foolishly believe that a bad weapon is good. Some of this convolution gives way to depth as you learn and read online guides, but some remains. The leveling system is pretty cool, and the character build variety can make for a very interesting party. Although it seems unanimously true that a Lone Wolf is the best way to guarantee your victory, I think you would lose out a lot on the game, since the character interactions are pretty cool.  Finally, the interest-killingly bad: It takes more clicks than you can imagine just to sell all the junk in your inventory to a blacksmith. A blacksmith who wanders around her shop endlessly, and in trying to talk to her, you'll inadvertently steal her pliers, because they're the same button, which will cause her to dislike you permanently. I hope you saved before trying to talk to the blacksmith! Traveling around even on the first island takes a long time, and there is no real guidance. Once I scummed my way through the first boss and got to the second area, I realized this was going to be a pattern. I was tired of it immediately. Then I got into about 20 no-warning fights, where I effectively watched a cinematic of enemies popping into existence from somewhere, getting first initiative, and murdering my entire party in a single turn, and I completely lost interest. I don't think it should be my job to magically know where I can safely go next.  I hope development continues for this game. There's a lot of potential. Although this is the kind of game where spending your money on it makes the gaming ecosystem stronger, and it has a lot of truly unique strengths, I still can't recommend it."

Since he wasn't in the party, I had no way to know this had happened.  I went back though my saves and apperantly he bugged upon resetting to his normal waiting spot when I removed him from the party,  It meant backing up 4 hours.  I walked away.

1121,wall.owen,15,No,0,"July 25, 2017",Not Recommended,71.0,"This game would be great if it weren't mechanically broken beyond the point of playability. The story is great I'm sure, good characters, good graphics, etc.  But the line of sight/line of fire system is extremely critical to the tactical combat, and it's extremely broken. You will not spend five hours playing before you will find yourself in a situation where you do not have line of sight or line of fire when you absolutely should, or when the enemy is able to attack you when they absolutely shoud not have line of sight/line of fire.  When this basic aspect of a tactical combat game is so totally arbitrary and senseless, it makes combat feel totally stupid, unbelievable, and unfair. Even if you win, it just feels stupid."

1123,Draba,41,No,0,"November 4, 2017",Not Recommended,4.1,"Basic combat mechanics are a big letdown for me, the tactician mode in the original kickstarter reward came with a promise that it won't simply be a numbers change. It's exactly that, stats get even more inflated and nothing else that matters is different.  My concrete gripes: Attributes are ARPG level simplistic: pump X for damage, maybe Y if you want more HP for some reason, enough memory to get what you want. Stats get massively inflated between levels, items get obsolete every 30 minutes. Armor system is just dumb, both the split damage resists and the 100%/0% CC prevention. The first game's CC spam was also bad, but there are a lot of better solutions than this thing. Make CC duration get reduced by stats/armor/in general, anything really. Initiative doesn't matter, I go / you go between teams(ok, you could get it on 1 party member). It possible that the game is fun if all you only care about a story and bonking a few baddies on the head. I mostly played the first game for the combat and it was really imbalanced, but fun.  Really don't like this one and I regret my purchase, devs lost my goodwill by entirely ignoring player feedback during the beta. Holding out for mods and maybe an EE fixing the broken parts and improving the silly ones."
1124,gjhall71,407,No,0,"September 29, 2017",Not Recommended,265.7,"Updated:  After getting  to the final  battle I can say game still needs developed and balanced.  You can tell it was rushed  out. The best act is Reapers Coast (2nd act).  3rd just feels rushed and 4th is  just confusing, unpolished and unless you do things in a certain order - some quests just start / end or aren't available.  Combat: you will always be outgunned, out positioned and enemies will hit you even if you are  not  LOS and seem to  have  a lot more action points.  You can  be charmed, mind dominated, taunted  (which is charmed when it is applied on your guys) in which your charater will use any good consumable and have double the action  points that you would have if you were controlling the char.  Crafting:  A joke.  Unless  a  blade  on a stick  is a good weapon.  The only craftable armor  is some eternal armor (just the chest).  Inventory management is - well it's a game in itself all the components that don't do much.   Ask somebody to post a screen shot of the  ""weapons and armor"" recipes available  - you won't see that screen shot on the game page from the developers.  Plot:  wanted to like it - but it ends up being very dark. if you like to be the hero / good guy - pass  - there are no good guys (seriously).  Want to get  needed experience - have to go around butchering people for experience.  In the end all sides are evil. (no joke).  Interface: cludgy. I find myself having to click on a button 2 or 3 times for it to register.  So when i want to choose a knockdown arrow - better make sure the click took.  Final  battle: LMFAO.  even if you tried to  spread your guys out - the conversation that starts with the end ""bosses"" move all of your characters clustered and surrounded by the enemy to get nuked (all magic armor bye bye in first persons attack) - just for 2nd set of bosses to come on simultaneiously. I think by the time my 2nd person had their turn  (all my guys have 40+  initiative) - 2 were dead.   Not fun. 2 of my guys that died didn't even have a turn yet.   Rez? - nope the other 2 were silenced .   Only thing I look for in a game is a challenge through FAIR game play - not having things stacked against the player like dark souls 2.   Any person that plays  this game will be saving and loading more than any other game.  That should  tell the developers something.   I didn't finish the last battle because at this point the game is just frustrating.  If i could apply true tactics in the last fight -  i would wait until all the bosses (about 12 of them -including  all the ones you beat arleady in the game and last game come back, a huge dragon and insane worm that takes up about 20%  of the screen and vomits previous bosses up) fight it out and come back and fight what is left.   But you can't you are intnetionally put in the center of it all with a huge target on you."
1125,Echoic,284,No,0,"November 14, 2016",Not Recommended,143.3,"I can't neatly describe why I find it boring but I'd say it's mainly the early character development and lack of a coherent character motivation in the early game.  You can choose to have one of 6 backstories or no backstory.  And somehow these backstories seem so thin and formulaic as to be practically irrelevant to the game.  With little motivation to explore the map and a highly generic setting populated by one dimensional characters... this is a recipe for zzzzzzzz.  It's a shame since this is a highly sophisticated and even a unique game in many ways.  After an action packed intro the game proper starts on a gorgeous beach.  You can choose to walk around, and if you like, pick up the shells and detritus.  And you think to yourself... why bother?  For me, this is a feeling that never went away playing Div 2 (though I've only made it up to the end of chapter 2).  Within a minute you meet a talking lizard thing guy who in some very awkward dialogue explains that he is a shipwreck survivor, a former Emperor... ugh.. what else... a fugitive from justice, the sole Red skinned example of his race... a proud and noble warrior or maybe a wizard or anything you want him to be.  At this point I was pretty much certain that this was going to be a boring game.  I don't care if he's Jar Jar Binks, no matter how important and interesting you tell me you are you're only serving to highlight that I've got no emotional connection to anything you say or the world or even any investment in my own character.  So I mechanically criss cross the space completing mini quests in any which way you like, because... that's just what you do in a video game.  Some of the quests were good some are just okay all of them are as familiar as you would expect from a genre fiction setting.  Your character levels up, you learn more about the world.  But somehow there's just no tension at all.  The drama ramps up a little later with talk of all caps GODS, THE UNIVERSE and DOOM.  A hackneyed plot foreshadowing some sort of pick option A through D ending once all the combat is done.  The voice acting was fairly good in parts and the (subject matter aside) written narration verges on great.  But it lacks some sort of spark of excitement or creativity.  That is kinda what I'm hoping for when I invest time in a game.  The combat is complex and something of a mixed bag.   Correct positioning for instance is a crapshoot when most characters can teleport and solid ground can become a flaming oil spill and then an electrical storm in the space of a single turn.  Victory can often come down to whether or not you know before hand what abilities your enemy is likely to use.  All in all I'd give the combat part of this game a grudging recommendation but I've been a long time fan of turn based games.  What I really admire about this game is how sort of 'complete' the game rules are.  Everything that happens in game tends to be consistent within its rule set.  It's not as sophisticated as 2007's Oblivon for example but the game engine is certainly the most excellent part of this game and they even had time to inlcludes cool features like multi and DM'ing... though I couldn't really rate them since I didn't try them."

The game had its own charm and the flaws in the system ,overpowered/ underpowered abilitys made it fun to play. The areas and creatures you encountered kinda made sense and you knew generally what to expect.  With that said the enhanced edition was released and the game took a turn for the worse becoming an overbalenced borefest.  This is where Divinity original sin 2 comes in. Just like the enhanced edtion it has great graphics, fun original content,etc etc...  but....its just not like the first. It lacks charm.  I will say straight away I have never  played a game more irritating than this one. The enemies are perfect. They are annoyingly perfect in even action they take. It's just silly. The enviroments are cleary fabricated to put you at the disadvantage. There has clearly been too much time put into making sure that you cannot do anything, but be at the disadvantage. Its maddening.  Things I HATE about this game.     1. Every enemy is everything and every ability is the same. What fun is it when fighting a zombie( in a tactical game) and you get out of range of the zombie( tactically) because, its a zombie and you don't want it close, just to end up getting hit with a ""zombie shot"" while the zombie carefully dodges the obstacles in its path, or you end up having him instantly next to you with a ""zombie teleport"" or even worse he runs over and punches his ally to heal his friend. That is not a zombie, why is every creature so tactical? Why even bother with graphics? Its deceptive and makes no sense. I have seen guys hit themselves to hurt my character, just because they knew it would give me some kind of status effect or kill me. I have seen enemies cast shackles of pain on my charactoer and as the last link to the chain formed they stabbed themselves in the heart. It utter rubbish and it is completely out of character. To add to that , every guy seems to have every ability with just a different name. Its boring, even melee characters can teleport around. At least make them look like they are jumping with their ability, not make it look like magic. I thought the characters on the board were supposed to be each special and different. That is why you have 4 characters right? what is this? Gauntlet? Can't hit them close with your axe so you throw axes? Boring. Rubbish.      2. Overpowered and broken status effects. Taking away people's turns and damaging them is a good way to create one way to do things. Why hit someone with a regular attack when you can take away their turn also. ""Hmm. I don't think I will get battle stomp, where I can hit multple people, destory elemental ground and take away turns, Im going to get something more my character like threaten....(I do have to admit I love watching my characters have threaten cast on them, apparently they are so taunted they do ineffective things to the enemy that taunted them, but also manage to do effective things to harm my team, while also using all of my items for no reason. Hmm.. I going to cast this weak fire spell instead of hitting you for 6k a pop... Rubbish) Dealing with staus effects using armor makes little sense. What is the point of battering ram if you can only use it after you have beaten people down? Isnt it a charge??? I mean they are already standing right next to you at this point! One of the most frusterating things about this game is that almost every fight I witness NPCs making choices simply because they A. They knew everything about my character (and they shoud not). (Glass cannon is a good example. They somehow just know you have glass cannon so they ALL target you for status effects. It is absolutely hair pulling annoying.) Or B. They knew the outcome to every possible choice. Either way this makes them very frusterating to fight. Not fun, frusterating. Games are supposed to be fun    3. Overbalenced. The game is so balenced it is boring.It reminds me of playing everquest and then moving over to play EQ 2.  It forces characters to be ""even"" (through loot, class abilites etc etc..) regardless of the choices you make. Don't believe me? Just look at the loot, its clearly designed for flat stat'ers. When was the last time you saw an armor peice designed for a melee character that had incredible characteristics that required a stacked stat such as strength? My warrior has many a point placed into stats that do nothing for me but make it so I can wear the awesome armor that requires intelligence or finesse.. Scale mail with bonuses to intelligence and various spellcasting bonuses, but requires strength to wear....Please point out a piece of armor and prove me wrong.    4. Every enviroment is everything and every enviroment is not your playpen it is their's. Having trouble with a fight? Run away. Make them come to you. If you can...What should be very clear when playing this game is that confrontations are not setup for you to have any advantage. Alot of time and thought has clearly been put into this. In the first game it seemed more of any ""everybodies playground"". In this game it seems that the enviroments were designed to make it more difficult for players, not as a playpen for everyone. We found it so annoying and difficult that my friend and I just engage fights without even talking to people as a general rule of thumb, because they will attack you anyway, after being jerks, then run away and it works well. (What is up with stat checks? I mean 40+ in a stat and you just lose. pfft.)  5. Throw away guys. I hate fighting enemies who are powerful threats to my survival, but when they are killed they seem to be just empty..... First off.. I want to see their character sheet. How did they, being the same level as me become a wizard who bests me in every stat, hp, armor, strength,  etc etc.. who clearly have items. Where are they? Where are all of their items? They must be pretty dang good to make them as powerful as they are. That is what risk and reward are all about. This game ultimately ends up being all just a risk on my part, with little to no payout. I think if there was one point I could drive home to all games it would be this. There has to be risk on both sides at the very least to confirm the realism of your opponent. You cannot roleplay when everyone is just a shadow of a person.  6. Special campiagn characters. I decided to make my own character and use Lohse and the red prince as my others. I spent time gearing them and leveling them up with the stats I wanted for MY TEAM. Only to have toward the end of the game them both leave the group via result of the story. What?!?! Really?? Why would you do that? I get the idea behind the story, but why would you set players up for failure? There is still team oriented game to be played left. Why would you do that? *Shrug* *laugh* Really?....

It's got so many bugs, so many issues, so many badly scripted areas that I've honestly spent half my play time trying to game around the constant bugs. I can't go through a single act of the game without encountering at least five bugged quests, two bad encounters, and two persuasion checks that either do nothing or have options that auto fail no matter what your stats are.  I'm sick of missing out on content because they can't beta test properly. I'm sick of missing vendors, missing quest givers, and auto-failing quests because of absolutely mental failure states like accidentally wandering into the next area (I'm looking at you act three). I'm sick and tired of most of the gear I find being underleveled and useless and having to mass sell everything I find so I can buy one or two decent gear upgrades and I'm sick of the number bloat at end game where an item two levels higher is more than twice as good as an item you have so I have to totally regear my entire party every two levels. It's not fun, it's tedious and it takes away any real excitement at finding rare gear because you know in about an hour or two it'll be useless.  There are so many issues with the game right now it's not even funny and the last patch broke more stuff than it fixed and that was ten days ago at the time of this review and it's still not been addressed so take my advice and just not buy this untill Larian works out the stupid number of bugs and the game gets to an actually playable state."

To start off I generally don't like companion-oriented gameplay where you're given a few characters and expected to be overly attached to them. I seriously find them impossible to care about, why should I be interested in these people? A lot of characters feel contrived and unbelievable as-well, especially the dwarves and their Scottishness for some reason (I've been to Scotland and it feels extremely unnatural for everybody to have shrunken by two to three feet since my last visit).  There's too much exposition given to things and people and dialogue that I have to wade through, which is equally as brain-numbingly horrible. It wouldn't be so bad if I found the lore captivating in the slightest, but the game is littered with fantasy cliches. As-in not the occasional elf/dwarf/orc/whatever sprinkled about, it's built on everybody being a human or elf or dwarf or lizard and the protagonist being a chosen one and the world being threatened at the hands of darkness monsters.  Conversation is mildly fun but if you've not got persuasion you're basically doomed, and you can only really specialise in one thing (including persuasion) unless you want to be totally incompetent. It also becomes boring rather fast, despite the unique tags and whatevers.  Similarly, the idea of the Divine Order being horrible and depraved below the surface is unique, but it's rubbed in so utterly thick my brain just sighs and goes ""Yes, I know they're turning people into mindless husks, yes they're horrible and callous, yessir, yes anything you say"" whenever the fact decides to violently club itself back into obviousness as you see Divine Order Depravity No. 8000.  It's as though the game itself is conscious of its sheer mundanity. I hit the ancient civilisation bit and the architecture is literally geometrical, as though to say ""♥♥♥♥, I can't be bothered to make any more countryside/forest/castle/tavern/dungeon anymore, why don't I just throw in a few granite shapes in a vaguely mystical looking fashion?"". The landscapes in-game are like what you'd get if you sampled British countryside in the middle of nowhere and injected a lot of rocks and wood and boats and Medieval-ish things.  You have to trudge through the borescape via teleportation and agonisingly light-paced jogging. Peering down on your little avatar. It's about as riveting as it sounds.  Then, there's combat! I advise you never attempt Lone Wolf (I.E. soloing) unless you truly want to multiply the tedium and horrific feeling of time-wasting emptiness tenfold. That is seriously not fun.  While I admire the tactical aspect of combat quite a lot, you will inevitably end up using your same strategy every time on a given character (to name a few of mine I have 'Dipping People in Oil and then Setting Them on Fire', 'Staying Invisible and then Teleporting Behind Somebody before Violently Gutting Them into a Bleeding Chicken with Ruptured Tendons before Turning Invisible Again' and 'Angrily Battering Somebody until you can Knock Them Over a Lot and Possibly Turn Them into a Chicken As-Well'). It becomes quite repetitive and dulls the planning aspect a fair bit, although I admit it can be rather fun, just not when it's tedious and long-winded.  There are hints of clicheness however, as I've found (personally) that a lot of abilities are rather common elemental things (fire/water, lightning, what have you) and you have generic ranger/assassin/warlord archetypes. I don't mind this however because it makes up for it with the more unique trees like Scoundrel, Necromancer and Polymorph (edgy choices I know, but I am somewhat fond of them), though I wish games would come up with more original ideas for magical abilities.  Overall, Divinity just feels like a very dull, empty and artificial experience that I am remorseful to have spent so much time on. Regardless though, I have enjoyed playing it with my brother. My main complaint is that it is too generic thematically, progress is too long and artifically stretched out, there are a lot of recycled assets and overall that it just doesn't have any spark or appeal that makes it feel special and like a lovely experience.  I have no clue why the game is held in such high regard, perhaps nowadays if a game is deemed functional and able to ram as many mechanical and thematic cliches into one bundle it makes for a revolutionary experience.  Either way, I think I would find performing violent dentistry on myself with an oversized cleaver for several hours more unique, imaginitive, fun and enlightening than every single hour that I've spent on Divinity."
