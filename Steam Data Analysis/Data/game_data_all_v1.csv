26,saturn missiles,183,253,2,2016-09-15,Recommended,341.5,"Simply put, Divinity: Original Sin 2 expands on the best ideas from the first game while taking a complete 180 in tone to deliver a much darker and adult experience compared to the first.  One of the most notable changes is immediately realized as character creation begins, with races, tags, origin stories, and a complete stat revamp giving a new level of depth to character creation. The origin story presets, while not customizable, deliver a unique experience for each. All of the notable ""origin story"" characters have interactions with each other, and even if you choose not to create them yourself, they can be found and interacted with around the world. Not only this, but you can recruit these important figures of the lore. Origin stories on the surface level seem gimmicky, but allow for a whole new level of replayability, in combination with the tag system. The tag system allows you to acquire new tags that effect quests and dialogue as you progress through the game, or assign them to your custom character in character creation. ""Origin story"" characters will have these tags preset, as well as a brief synopsis of their lore.   However, the changes aren't just to the character creation. As soon as you get into combat, you'll quickly notice how much has changed. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the basics of the first game intact, action points have recieved a complete overhaul, streamlining the process of choosing actions. While the new system (6 action points total; 4 action points at the start of encounter. Most skills cost 1-2 action points) may seem to cater to a more casual audience at first, the new skills that accompany this revamp allow for a level of complexity in combat never before seen in the Divinity series. New skills introduced in the second game are more ambitious, creative, and innovative than any in the first game. Even from the start of the game, you'll acquire interesting abilities that you can use to control the battlefield. The new targeting system provided in D:OS2 gives a sense of clarity lacking in the first game. Height advantages and disadvantages means that positioning matters now more than ever before. In addition to the ""surfaces"" system of the first game (fire, poison, poison clouds, static clouds, electrified water, etc), most of these surfaces can now be blessed and cursed for interesting variations and choice in combat. For example, while fire is harmful to your team, if you bless it, it'll apply a heal every turn and prevent the members within from being frozen.   The campaign here is of absolutely astounding quality and length - my first full playthrough of the game took roughly 80 hours, even without dozens of sidequests. No matter your choice of origin character or custom, you'll find the campaign to be deeply satisfying. However, as noted by the developers, you are meant to play with the origin story characters - and it shows. Each origin character has at least half a dozen unique encounters. While the game is still engaging if you're playing as a custom character, the origin stories really do allow for a better capacity for role playing and it's interaction in the game world.  For the Steam Awards of 2016, this is my pick for the Most Astounding Game. The staggering amount of interactions in the game, even in alpha, can be overwhelming. Divinity: Original Sin 2 could very well shape up to be Game of the Year 2017 for me."
197,ArenMook,174,16,0,2016-09-15,Recommended,390.6,"If you've enjoyed the first Divinity: Original Sin, you owe it to yourself to pick up this one. Larian took everything that was great about the first game and made it even better.  Word of warning though, it's easier to screw up in DOS2 than it is in DOS1. Literally a minute into the game you can either recruit or kill your first companion, simply depending on how you talk to them.  Stealing mechanics changed from DOS1 -- both guards and whoever owns the item will actively seek out the thief (you), and should they find you red-handed, throw you in prison, attack or simply take the stolen merchandise, again depending on how you talk your way out of the situation. Fortunately even if you choose the violent option, the game is still perfectly playable. Merchants and civilians don't participate in the fight.  I'd write more, but I think I'll just go ahead and play some more instead."
291,A Catgirl is Fine Too,394,20,2,2016-09-15,Recommended,108.5,"The first Original Sin game was my favorite title of 2014, and I have been impatiently waiting for the sequel from the moment I finished it. I am pleased to report that it has been well worth the wait. Larian Studios have a fundamental understanding of what makes a good sequel: Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the things that made the original great, and builds on the areas that were lacking.   The art design is even more stunning than before, and the one act currently available is packed with things to do. I've already found numerous clever ways to solve both major and minor quests. Combat, arguably the most important aspect of the game, has remained largely the same, with the addition of new mechanics such as height and cursed surfaces to keep things fresh. The plot in the first game was one of my few complaints, as it felt generic and poorly paced in places. However, in Original Sin 2 I find myself much more intrigued and very much like what I have seen of the story so far. Although the game is still in early access as I write this, it already feels like a straight upgrade from Original Sin 1.  As far as criticism goes, the music currently feels slightly lackluster, although being able to choose a special instrument to play during climactic moments is a novel idea. One of my complaints from the first game was that by the end of it, combat had begun to feel tedious. As I said, combat is still fundamentally the same, but I have yet to explore all the new features and I hope they keep combat exciting across my multiple inevitable playthroughs.   Of course, as an early access title, bugs and glitches come with the territory, but I have yet to experience a game-breaking one. I am currently playing on ultra on a moderately powerful laptop, and performance has been stable, with an average FPS of 60-65.   In conclusion, did you like Divinity: Original Sin? If yes, you'll love this one too. If for some reason you didn't, you're not going to find a completely new experience here, although it might have fixed what you disliked. If you're new to the franchise, I'd always suggest buying the finished first game over the unfinished early access game, but if you're a fan of turn-based RPGs you'll likely get more than your money's worth. I have a huge amount of respect for Larian Studios and I don't doubt for a second that Divinity: Original Sin 2 will only get better from here. "
324,LugdunonTG,744,16,0,2016-09-15,Recommended,91.7,I loved Divinity: Original Sin both in Co-op and Single player. The first time I played it was that same feeling in D&D when you realise you can do nearly anything. Divinity: Original Sin 2 carries on this legacy incredibly well already considering it's early state. In the short time I've played I met a host of weird and interesting characters. Stumbled upon various quests that aren't just in plain site.  This is the way I love my RPG's this game rewards you for exploring and taking risks. Just because the odds seem against you does not mean they are as long as you use the environment to your advantage. Blood puddles on the floor can become electrified to shock people on them. You can contaminate them to poison people and use fire to cause poison to combust. It's a wonderful game that I feel like will improve on the original in every way once it's finished. The early version does contain bugs and is obviously missing many aspects but if you wanna just mess around with builds or the new PvP modes then now is as good a time to jump in as any as long as you realise its not fully fleshed out YET. High recommendation from me for all RPG fans.   https://youtu.be/LxvdYIl1IMI  Here's some Gameplay if you wish to see more and I may consider making this a series with enough interest otherwise I check back every few updates.
349,ReaperX30,306,13,1,2016-09-15,Recommended,14,"Having backed the first one on Kicksarter and owning it on PC and Xbox One, I was already sold on the sequel but even with it being an Alpha version at the moment it's already showing how great the final game will be. My PC can only handle it on Medium but it's still really pretty and run smooth. The first thing that will hit you though is how magical the soundtrack is. The people who did the music really knocked it out of the park.  One of the new feature is the Origin Story which is basically premade characters with independant questlines meaning that if you play with someone and you choose a different character than you'll have things to do that the other won't and the same for them. I'm not a big fan of fixed character but the story of the one I went with (Lohse) is pretty interesting so far. Even if you choose one of the Origin Stories you still can customize your character's hair, hair color, Skin color, facetype and class.  I haven't played a lot but I'm already hooked. It's a game still in Alpha and it's better than some I've seen in final state. Larian Studio have showed that they make quality games and this is no different. I highly recommend the game."
390,Kozzy - Red Dead Redemption 2!,587,15,0,2016-09-15,Recommended,194.8,"Divinity Original Sin 1 was good, but Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best rpg's of not only this year, or of this generation, but of all time. The writing is a huge improvement, the voice acting is brilliant and the strategic combat is even better than before. The game is a blast solo or with a friend, tons of customization and many ways to go about doing missions. So many cool skills to play with it is amazing!  I have not been this addicted to a modern roleplaying game since Fallout New Vegas or The Witcher 3 (Sure I loved Divinity Original Sin 1, Dragon Age origins, Pillars Of Eternity,etc.. but these are on another level for me personally). Every aspect shines in this game and my biggest complaints are improved this go around. Larian deserves a ton of respect and love for making such a great, epic roleplaying game. This game has a ton of replay value and will played for many more hours for me.   Games of this quality don't come out that often, go support Larian and buy this wonderful game, get ready for some wonderful adventures! Hands down GOTY for me in 2017. I enjoyed alot of games this year but nothing game close to the total package Divinity Original Sin 2 offers. If you enjoyed Divinity original Sin 1, pick this up ASAP.  If you didn't like Original Sin 1, there is still a good chance you will fall in love with the sequel, as everything is improved.  Well done Larian, well done!  **Over 170 hours later, what a game! Not only one of the best rpgs of modern times but also ever. Just a real joy to play and you can tell the developers put a ton of effort into this game. Other rpg devs take notes! The game has the best turnbased combat, much improved writing, wonderful world design, tons of fun quests, it is very challenging (Dark Souls who?) and gorgeous art design. While it is great when playing solo, this game has some of the best coop with a friend (or a few) that I have ever witnessed, not just in rpgs but any genre, grab a friend and get ready for a really amazing ride. This is a perfect example for how to turn a good game's sequel into a much improved (in nearly every aspect) masterpiece**  **The Definitve Edition has come out and it is fantastic, what a wonderful job Larian does at giving us a free enhanced edition a year later. Last years GOTY just got better, somehow! I can't wait to see what Larian does next, they have been on fire lately!**"
889,Jackal ??,519,9,0,2016-09-15,Recommended,25.1,"Glad I opted in for early access. The game might seem pricey for an early access title, but it was definitely worth the investment.

907,@Neiffarious,236,4,0,2016-09-15,Recommended,57.6,"So my brother and I played through most of the first act. I'm not saying that we got through most of the content because I'm sure there is stuff we missed out on for whatever reason. Playing through the first act was very exciting. Although I must admit it started out a little bit slowly, but i feel like a lot of games in this genre can have kind of a slow start, in part because there is so much to do you might feel overwhelmed.  I'm not going to get into great detail about any of this, i'm not professional reviewer, but I'm going to adress some things that are pretty important to me when deciding whether or not to buy a game:  Is it worth getting this game in early access? - In my opinion, as a big fan of this genre, yes There is probably 10-13 hours of content if you try to do EVERYTHING. More content to be added such as New playable undead race, more origin stories, new areas to explore etc. There is so much content coming and so much that I missed out on as well. there are a few bugs. keep that in mind.   How is it mechanically to the first Original Sin? - A drastically better inventory system, skill system seems to be much deeper, and there is a bit more variety in ways to play as each skill point provides some kind of bonus besides just allowing you to use higher level skills IE: Necromancy gives you lifesteal, or Hunstman reduces the penalty for firing from low ground gives a bonus for attacking from high ground etc. etc.  Bugs?  - Yes, a few that really stuck out: Blank Conversation boxes that require a reload to escape from, quests unable to be complete even with all the items in your inventory, and smaller ones like ressurecting a character but instead of standing up they slide around the ground. These kinds of things are 100% expected in early access so avoid this game if you aren't willing to try to squash them.  How is the Story?  - Personally I find it much more engaging this time around. As a Sourceror there is a lot more room to be the bad guy if you would prefer it. In the first one it didn't make much sense to be an Evil Source hunter. I don't want to spoil anything at all but there were a lot of moments, even in side quests, that I thought were really cool. Some kinda sad stuff too with the Pet Pal Talent (Which lets you talk to animals).  Overall, I found it to be very worthwhile. I am excited to see new content added and bugs fixed as time goes by. So far, Larian is really knocking it out of the park.   TL;DR: I really enjoyed it. It is not yet complete. IF you're a fan of isometric or old-school RPGs this game is for you. Co-Op is fun. Skill system is neato. If you want a super complete experience this is not the game for you. Hope this helped someone!"

978,SOPMOD Musket,463,4,0,2016-09-15,Recommended,195.5,"Pretty good so far.  Its only in early access but I am impressed from what I see so far.  The combat seems more enjoyable, especially if you make a super tank class.  In DOS1 being a straight tank would require you to use your whole first turn just to walk over to the enemy since you were so weighed down with armor.  With there being fewer action points, it almost seems like you can do more.  Some things in game are still locked off, like the ability to change starting skills, but its still fun.    If you are unsure whether to get this game or not, since you have not played the first game, BUY THE FIRST GAME and try that out since it is only $20 now.  If you dont enjoy how that games mechanics are, you probablt will not enjoy this one."

956,Shadowblazen,55,44,23,2016-09-15,Not Recommended,3.1,"The initial introduction to the game has a lack of direction/goals, it was unclear what you're supposed to be doing after jumping into the game. Dialogue is not compelling or engaging, it's just plain text boxes with no voice narration. There are no tutorial battles to really explain the combat system, and there's not enough weak enemies in the starting area to practice combat. As a new player, I didn't find sufficient scaffolding to help me learn and the experience wasn't engaging enough to make me want to continue playing."

241,Apollo,"1,168",15,0,2016-09-16,Recommended,199.3,"I should start by saying that I am huge fan of the last game and I came in with the highest expectations.  My only problems for the first game were (1) character customization and (2) the lighthearted nature of the story.    Well, so far, Original Sin 2 has fixed those problems with a jackhammer.  I mean the customization isn't perfect, but it is leagues improved from the last game.  And the tags are awesome.  As for the nature of the story, it is much more grimdark.  Plus, with the tags, you can already tell there will be tons of replayability.    The game is beautiful.  And it's scary to know that this game is going to get so much better.  Heck, knowing this studio, we'll probably get an enhanced edition.    This isn't a full game and I don't usually recommend games in early access, but considering the source and based on how much fun I've had with this, I have to recommend. it."
284,Xilil,57,14,0,2016-09-16,Recommended,127.9,"Everything that made Original Sin 1 is in here, plus loads of extras that add to the experience.  Character development now allows for much more flexibility. In OS1 it was pretty hard to make some original combos like a battlemage because of the way skills and attributes worked. Now it feels like characters are much more customizable to whatever crazy combination you want to have.  The graphics are also a huge improvement. The PBR-rendering makes everything look stunning while preserving the nice aesthetics of the first game.  The single player Act that is available to Early Acces offers a lot of content. The replayability is also quite high. There are quite a lot of ways to complete your goals, which will make every playthrough a bit different.   The only problem that I think this sequel still has, is that sometimes it's hard to find the content for your level. Because of this you sometimes end up just running around looking for those level 4's you still need to kill to level up.   I thought PvP was going to be kind of nice, but that is quite the understatement. The PvP is one of the best PvP experiences I had in a long time. There's so much depth to it, while still keeping it fun. This is were the additions in combat from Original Sin 1 really show their beauty with Source skills and tons of new surface combo's like blessed fire. I just hope there will be a matchmaking system eventually because the server browser isn't that good in my opinion. People try to put up private matches in public, so everytime someone joins they instantly kick them.  Which brings me to my last complaint, which is that the game visibility of single player is the same as the visibility of multiplayer. This means that if you want to play single player, and right after that create an arena lobby, you have to change the setting every single time.  In conclusion I think it still has its flaws which is normal ofcourse, but at its current state it is already a beautiful and fun game."

Although there is only one chapter available at this time, there is a big island to explore with hidden secrets like treasure and hidden caves. The combat is deep and has a nice tactical twist to it and definitely feels more smooth compared to the first game.  However, before buying this, keep in mind that this game is still in early access for at least half a year. So there is no voice acting yet, some sound effects will be missing, you might encounter quite a few bugs and glitches and most important of all, there is only one chapter available at this time (you still get 8-15 hours of gameplay from this, plus there is an online pvp arena).  If you don't mind the lack of content and if you are a fan of a bit more slow-paced rpg, this game is definitely something for you."

It's going to be tough to wait it out. Because now I know just how good it will be.  The game plays much like the first - just better. It's design, the more polished and tweaked systems. I've been playing with a friend who is new to the series and honestly I laugh when I tell him about some of the systems in place.  ""Yeah so you can teleport that bad guy and drop him on that bad guy and they'll both get hurt.""  Or  ""Right, did you pick up that corpse's leg? Oh, well pick it up and we'll take it to an Elf so they can eat and tell us where to go next.""  Or  ""I'm not sure what to do, we might want to talk to that cat.""  Lol.  Playing this game by yourself is great - playing with another person, or better in a larger group... man this game is gold.   I've still got a lot of play left in this game - but I dread finishing it and having to wait for the rest. So I'm taking my time. If I can spend a couple of extra hours where someone else would take only 1 I'll be a happy bunny.  Anyways, if you like this sort of game (and honestly who wouldn't?) do yourself a favour and pick this up for you and a friend. Just remember to come into it with the knowledge you're going to have to wait until next year for the full thing."

Several characters each with their own stories, custom characters with their own story. I have 60ish hours and still find new things each time I play through it. So many different interactions with various elements. New spells, magic schools, and more. If you like cRPGS, or the last game  and don't wanna wait, then I'd buy this game for sure.

105,Sarlic,335,43,0,2016-09-18,Recommended,152.5,"EDIT:  Below this edit is the original review I made during Early Access. Currently I would have to say 100% of my issues with the game in the early access were addressed even before the release. The AI has been improved to the point they make choices a skilled player may make. The Mass AP issue has been entirely resolved. The issue with certain skills not being balanced as in Hailstorm, Single Dagger and others have all been rebalanced and made entirely fair.   To add to this they have outdone themselves by adding FULL voice acting in the game, something that was only in the first one after the enhanced edition. The mechanics for the undead are entirely fleshed out. The storyline is entirely fluid and fleshed out. I can honestly say this game has not only met but exceeded my every expectation is entirely justified in its price for the quality put into it. Larion Studios has released a game that shows what EARLY ACCESS should be used for and it's benefits. I whole heartedly look forward to their next game.  EARLY ACCESS ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'll start by saying that I am well aware it's early access so some features are clearly not available as of yet.  The game is indeed an improvement overall to the first game, the combat is more fluid and challenging however I do see an issue in the fact the AI seemingly has collosal amounts of AP and can walk halfway across the field and still attack. This was an issue in the first game as well though and not a fault in D:OS2.  Even the very first goal of chapter one can be suceeded in so many ways including simple brute force if you happen to be a tactical genius. The added Highground vs Lowground bonus/penalty for ranged attacks in a great addition as it adds other dimension to the tactics in combat.   My greatest complaint is really just a matter of not being able to test out the true customization of the character classes. I also admit that the first town in D:OS seemed to have so much more to do but I do enjoy the more serious and adult approach of D:OS2.  All in all I genuinely believe the game is worth picking up, not necessarily saying people should buy it now at full price but it will definitely be a game worth playing with your friends. Albeit a very unforgiving game."

Everything that was good about the first game is still here so it's not like relearning an entirely new game, and a lot of the clunkier parts about the first game like enormous skill cooldowns, being locked into 1 or 2 spell trees based on allocated points are refined and looking good. Love the sense of humour of the studio and the hard work and care they put into the game. Recommend highly for people who liked the first D:OS and for people new to the game. Don't need to have played the first D:OS to fully enjoy this one."

I don't if the studio is that badly in need for money to end (make would be a more exact word) to release an ALPHA (not a beta yet) version for 45 euros. I really wanted to like the game but currently it's almost impossible. There are so many bugs, unfinished quests. There is almost no story yet (Honestly, I had no problem with the first divinity but here I can't manage to understand a single quest and everything feels dull, I'm just running around killing things for what ? I don't ????ing know...)  All in all, I'm failry sure that this game will be good someday. But I don't support this Alpha version for 45 euros thing. I'm fine with advanced beta where the game is playable, enjoyable.  More importantly, playing the game right now is spoiling me the fun I could have by playing its final version. It's like seeing a bad trailer showing the whole movie while you know that you'll be able to see the real awesome movie later. Just don't do it."
87,Butcher Pete,231,37,7,2016-09-20,Recommended,159.7,"I played the first Divinity: Original Sin, and now I have played Divinity: Origin Sin 2 to completion (or to, at least, completion when it comes in terms of what is available in the alpha), and yet I am considering picking it up for a second run.  The combat of this game is excellent, and - I believe - is its shining feature.  And if you think you are particularly good at it there is now even a PvP arena in DOS 2.  With that said, if you did not like DOS 1, you will probably not like DOS 2.  The game is the same formula, practically the same combat system (with a few improvements and a few setbacks), and really the same story-quality of the first game.  You might find the story a little disappointing if you bought into all the hype that Larian threw down about hiring so many writers, when really what you are looking at is pages and pages of written dialogue (no voice acting) that you will probably begin to skip through six hours into the game.  And I say that as someone who loves books (Andrej Sapkowski's Blood of Elves is sitting right next to my keyboard).  But, look on the brightside: it's still early access right?  They could improve it... well, at least we can hope.  While I certainly have enjoyed DOS 2 for its combat, graphics, and character design... the story is not going to win any awards if it stays in its current form.  If that is going to be a deal breaker for you then I suggest you wait until the game is finished and see how it is then.  But if a badass combat system is enough to draw you in, then I'll see you in the arena!  (Oh, by the way, I should mention that the lizards in this game look really, REALLY badass... and sexy. :3)"
208,Aries,82,14,0,2016-09-20,Recommended,85,"So far the game has been a joy to play. The game has taken up a notch both in gameplay and in looks since the last DOS-game. The combat is more fluid and enjoyable, the effects are as beautiful as they go most of the time and the dialogue is quite well written. But now I can get to the biggest complaint I have: Voice acting or the lack of. At the moment the only voice acting is in the intro and combat grunting. There is no dialogue voice acting so you have to read everything. That can be a good thing, true but I myself prefer voices. The rumors have told that there would never be any voice acting but we'll see if that's true in the final game. This is early access after all.  All in all Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an amazing game right from the start and this is in alpha. We have a lot more to get and the things we have now already impress. I haven't made it that far as of yet since I have been testing out a lot of stuff but I can already say quite a bit about general things."

Although it doesn't hold your hand when you first play it, I find the difficulty to be refreshing and welcome the challenge. Which RPG where you can play with up to 4 friends in co-op mode? None but D:OS2. The length of this Early Access is easily around 10 - 12 hours of gameplay if you just started to play.  NOTE: If you don't like reading through text-heavy dialogues, this game isn't for you, as the game assumed you understand and read what the NPC said to you to finish the quests.  I can't wait for the final product to be released, I assume there will be more origin characters released and hope that the developer will continue to polish and hear the input from the end-users."

924,The Mute Cynic,"3,225",10,2,2016-09-21,Not Recommended,45.4,"???Early Access Watcher Reviews  Update Version: 2.0.165.341  Disclosure: This game copy was bought by the reviewer. I have not participated in the Kickstarter for this game and only heard about it upon release on Steam.  Full Review: https://www.gatewaytogaming.com/divinity--original-sin-ii.html (Note: Had to remove first two paragraphs due to limitations)  Gameplay Footage (Spoilers of first hour): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEMTem3wiXk  Walking along the shoreline within the first few minutes, it is clear how detailed the environments in the game are. Texture quality is some of the best I have seen for foliage and building detail. Character models have a great look to them (lizards are simple gorgeous), but armor quality appears blurry at times, ranging from shimmering to ""still rendering"" dull. The way characters move in combat is another story though, sporting some great attack animations. Spell animations highlight the superior usage of particle effects, especially with the way the pyrotechnics and surface changes from spells were taken into account. Just a quick note on the sound department; music is great, if not a bit bland, but it does help fill the void left by the lack of voice-acting. Ambient sounds is decent, nothing special, but it gets the job done. Damp caves, lush jungles, and decrepit forts are all rendered well and are beautifully crafted set pieces for the possible battles some poorly chosen words inevitably initiate.   While the possibility to avoid battles is high due to a wide selection of dialog opportunities, it is not entirely avoidable. Everything is controlled by the use of actions points that replenish each turn or by the use of certain abilities. Movement, skills (with added cool downs), items, and looting all require these points and can cause the player to either horde AP for a future turn if they so desire. Equipment also dictates how much magic armor or armor on goes into battle with, soaking up blows from spells and attacks respectably before losing health. One system in particular that stands out is the environmental status effects such as frozen, stunned, or petrified. Stun multiple enemies by casting Rain and using a shock ability or cast hail to freeze an area that becomes prone to slipping (knocked down). It is a simple idea that makes battles even more tactical and much easier given the surprising difficulty of some of the fights.  While I managed to steamroll through my second playthrough on Exploration Mode, the Classic Mode does offer a couple of difficult fights. Part of this issue could stem from the extremely powerful starter abilities and the relative health amount from certain enemies. One spell was powerful enough (in both power and distance) to allow me to farm tougher opponents without entering combat. I ended up murdering everyone in Fort Joy without dying due to this spell and only found death once at the hand of the final boss. This also allowed me to complete the first Act on Classic in 7 hours while also completing plenty of side content (again, side-stepping by the use of this particular skill). It feels like an exploit to use this skill, but with some spell balancing and enemy distance detection fixes it might not be much of an issue. Outside of this, the final boss is tough as nails and there are plenty of scenarios with ""instant death"" outcomes. It is a challenging experience, but thankfully certain dialog options can side-step combat while introducing new story material.  Dialog plays a definitive role and results can vary depending on plenty of pre-requisites. Certain people will refuse to talk to lizards while others will not provide information unless a specific tag is used. A dwarf in Fort Joy, for instance, reacted positively to one of my party members due to a history they shared and through this conversation an item was produced and some lore was provided. Other cases are just an example of good dialog selection, apparent when dealing with the slugs in the hidden passage or the guard you meet further down the line. Persuasion also helps to deter tense scenarios, relying on stat warfare (stat >=< opponent stat) + persuasion to determine the outcome. All of these dialog routes add multiple ways to deter combat and benefit the roleplaying options already provided by the game's darker tone. It essentially made my second playthrough (this time on Exploration Mode) less reliant on combat, finishing the first Act in five hours.   The story this time around revolves around the Divine being dead and the voidwoken's numbers increasing due to the use of Source magick. As a ""sourcerer,"" the player is taken to Fort Joy to be ""cured"" of their curse, awarded a stylish collar to block the magick. Shipwrecked and alone, the player awakens on the shore and soon discovers the only salvation in sight is inside a camp run by the devout of the departed Lucian. This is the setting of a deeply troubling scenario that mixes an unknown protagonist amidst plenty of mentally scarred individuals and a questionable authority purely on the basis of paranoia. It opens up further as other NPCs join to hopefully escape the unknown consequences of conforming and most of it is well-written, including several side quests that range from disturbing to outright sickening. I have always been a fan of the more macabre settings and enjoyed what was on offer so far. Some of it is cliche, which at this point is hard to avoid, but the overall struggle is one I greatly approve of.  Being in alpha, there is bound to be issues creeping around in the cellar. When climbing vines (specifically the one lowered by someone later on), the current character will climb it normally, but the other party members will not climb it. During combat, the game pauses on the current character (with no AP) and seems to delay a good 10-15 seconds before it moves on to the next person in the rotation. Graphical issues can sneak up as well (helmet hidden removes hair, floating weapons, enemies clipping) as well as the obvious crashes that plague most early access games. Does it excuse it? Of course not.   While none of the following issues are deal breakers, they are quality of life issues that can make the experience rather annoying. Inventory items must be dragged to other slots in order to organize them and the system could really use a auto-sort feature. The camera can be very stingy when trying to zoom out and has a very limited scope that can make moving in some areas absolutely frustrating. There is no real direction in terms of locating the next objective, especially at the beginning. This last point isn't an issue for me (actually found it refreshing), but some areas might require loading a save file (Rex's Castle) due to an inability to leave.   My sword has been pierced into the shoreline of Fort Joy twice with a grand total of 12 hours between both play throughs. I spent a little time testing out the Arena mode on the 4p map to ensure it was functional, but it left a very weak impression on me. The main story felt a bit cliched, but the ominous vibes surrounding the campaign left me intrigued enough to play through it. I loved some of the side quests (never kiss a stranger) and applaud the colorful aesthetic for contrasting the depressing mode without feeling awkward. The bottom line, however, is too thin to support the hefty price tag for what is essentially a demo. I cannot recommend Divinity: Original Sin II at this time. Larian Studios has a successful history with early access and I hope to see how there second time around turns out when I come back to update my review upon full release.   Pros  - Visually impressive - Great combat - Story (what there is of it) is decent with a macabre overtone - Few great side quests   Cons - Content lite  - Crashes - Sound assets need work"

This leaves you fairly underleveled for the two ACT ending boss fights. + Pre-built characters are awful, annoying, and poorly scripted. + Story line is mediocre at best: you're special, the bad guys don't like you, following this linear progress of escape.

Initially the lack of voice acting was my only bane and still kind of is, but I can understand why with the amount of writers in this game as opposed to the first. Only 2 writers for Divinity Original Sin, there's triple that for this and voicing the game would take years. Conversations feel a lot more in depth too and I found myself voluntarily reading it as opposed to just skipping, which is what I ended up doing on Original Sin (not that it was boring, I loved the voice acting, just got very tedious in my opinion).

Update (Release): The game has finally released and I really have to say...Larian has out-done themselves. Playing through the game on Tactician and seeing how the AI does its best to break the combat system like a real player would, ending their turn with their back to a wall so your rogue is inefective, reversing your moves by throwing water on the enemy you just shocked and stunning your entire party, it's an incredible system that Larian has created so much flexibility, every move of every fight becomes a question of ""did that just happen? can I really do this?"" which is something no other game can capture.  Gone are the supercharged ridiculous characters of the first game, replaced with smarter and more adept enemies that force you to make better decisions. The flexibility in character creation and the much more intuitive world makes me excited every chance I get to jump on and uncover just a bit more of the world. The inclusion of a darker story and races adds a much needed party diversity and the lore being less silly pulls you in far more to the atmosphere (which is beautiful...from the musical score to the graphics) creating a much more enjoyable transition from combat to exploring, and giving you more to WANT to explore.   The beautiful score and excellent voice acting talent (so far) has been an incredible treat in an age when games have been spending less and less time and devotion to world building and character development. The party while smaller than some CRPGs, is fully fleshed out with interesting characters who I actually want to talk to and interact with.  So far I am incredibly excited with the release and looking forwarding to simply getting through ACT 1 on tactician and exploring the unknown. Well done Larian, you have brought art back into the gaming industry."

In response to that article I love having almost nothing at the beginning and having to scavenge. The loot system is really rewarding right now and I feel every piece of armour or weapon i find is making a difference in fights on Classic mode. Magic and Phsyical armour is great too, it's satisfying to break through armour and seeing the health bar drop like in bayonetta.  Only thing I wish which I loved in Pillars of Eternity was the ability to click on the map and have the camera go directly to that spot. Would save a lot of pointless time in moving the map trying to figure out where it is I want to go. Other than that this game pulled me right in.  "

They brought out a update which was a entirely new game with voice acting, new camera controls, new missions, more items/skills, everything changed so i played it and it was one of the best games i had played, i bought this on release and held off for a few days to finish the first game.. I tried the arena mode out and it is actually really fun! I then proceeded to the campaign with a friend of mine and was overwhelmed with the character screen for a alpha game.. I created a elf Necromancer.. I will eat everybody's corpse and steal their souls... That is what i love about this game, you can kill every single person in the game and still complete the story.. Well this game you (kind of) tell your own story, each race has it's own dialogue, each trait has it's own dialogue (bandit,rogue,scholar, that kind of stuff) and already for a alpha game seems almost finished! The story only has one act at the moment which i am SUPER BUMMED about but again.. It's alpha. Oh by the way..... There is a game master mode... Yup, you heard, DUNGEON MASTER! My dreams for a great game have become greater... Thanks Larian Studios!!"

I'll give steam and the developers the benefit of the doubt and hope this game is just terrible because it is early preview...but short of a miracle I'm pretty sure this is not a game that will be any better than the free alternative. I would offer more specifics on potential areas of improvement but honestly...there are too many to even start.  UPDATE: Refund Granted by Steam. Thank you.  WRT to specific issues...I admit it was a very short time that I played the game. But, I was underwhelmed by graphics (possibly related to my hardware), I found the interface less intuitive than alternatives like PoE or WoW, I found myself wandering around with no clear path, stumbled into an encounter and struggled through (lightning touch was too far 2 steps away, fireball blew up around me, couldn't tell if mobs were alive or dead, couldn't tell if I was on fire or not). wandered around some more with encounters with two NPC which I found tedious and boring, and then encountered a red lizard which I couldn't tell whether he wanted to join me or kill me.) I thought it was the latter when next thing I knew he was in my group despite misleading dialouge.  The we wandred into water and I had a textbox with the word WET appear on me which I found borderline pathetic. Honestly, at that point I wanted to jump off that bridge with the drepressed red lizard. So, I decided to cut my losses and request a refund instead. I'm sorry if my initial impression offends anyone and perhaps I may have come to love the game eventually as it matured and I understood the game better. But, I don't have enough game time to play anything less than great (so perhaps my mistake in testing the waters with an alpha game)."

244,Rhuzkii,243,29,2,2016-10-01,Recommended,394.9,"This game is incredible! I can't tell you though which game of the series is better, seeing that they are both AMAZING!  I just wanted to give some feedback on the things I personally think are too overpowered. So I played as a elf warrior, and your race ability as elf is that you get 1 AP and + 25% dmg for some constitution. Then as a warrior you have enrage, which gives you 100% crit, and you can choose a talent called ""War Lord"" which enables you to get 2 AP back when you execute an enemy. With Warrior having 3 charges (Blitz Attack, Battering Ram and Phoenix Dive) which only cost 1 AP and Crippling Blow and Whirlwind as AoE you can easily solo pretty much everything. Those things in combination with the golden double handed axe you can buy from an NPC not that far into Fort Joy's story line you are just way too powerful compared to everything else. I mean pretty much all I did with Lohse and Sebille was relocating enemies using Teleportation and then just utterly demolishing everyone with my warrior. Red Prince was basically only there for the extra cc, allthough I found out that stacking physical armour on him and giving him Bracus' Helm and letting him learn Overpower is incredibly powerful aswell, seeing that he can shatter enemies' physical armour in an instance, making them an easy target for chain ccing them. So that was the part about warrior being too powerful, now I wanted to move to the part where I REALLY like the idea of two different types of armour (physical and magical) and them protecting you from negative status effects, BUT on the other hand it's just way too easy to abuse this mechanic into chain ccing everything, making the fights not really challenging at all. So in the end I wanted to say: Don't get me wrong, I really REALLY like the game and I was soooo frustrated when I cleared the first act that I had to wait until the actual release of the game, but I personally found those things that I listed too powerfull."

Now before you say it was not perfect, let me say there is no such thing as perfection, we seek it and hopefully never find it. DOA was brilliant and that is a fact, not an opinion.  DOA2 well its ""more of the same"", and I know when people usually say that it is followed by a sigh and resignation and usually ""Uh"".  However not in the case of DOA2 it does all the DOA tick boxes but adds more, and I mean more in a very good way.  An example is when you start out in DOA2 you will find that crafting plays an important part of getting better equipment to survive.  There are even more ways to complete quests and some ways you can avoid quests, for example there are various ways to leave and some require a clever tongue others brute force or stealth and so much more.  The character backgrounds are an interesting and tease you with a more interesting and some quite meaningful motivation for escape and progression.  If this opening chapter is anything to go by then all I can say is ""more of the same"", YES PLEASE!...So put it on your wishlist or buy it."

Only the first Act is out for now, and despite that, even if I did not even do every available quest, I spent 15 hours on this game. That part of the campaign also happens to have good replayability, because every quest can be finished in a diverse number of ways. The gameplay, while lacking some polish and balance (not too long ago some skills were seriously overpowered), is impressive and looks like it's only going to get better. The story and the characters are well written, and endearing. The game managed to make me care about characters that I only met in one quest, which is indicative of its overall quality. In conclusion, despite the current version of the game being short, it is brilliant and shows a lot of promise. I applaud the people at Larian for their work, and I trust them to make this the awesome game I know it can be. Of course, you should only buy it in its current state if you want to support the developpers, as, in its current state, it is not worth 45 I will update my review as soon as that changes, however.  EDIT: Well, the game is out now, and boy, I wasn't disappointed. The two new playable characters, Fane and Beast, are every bit as interesting as the other ones, and bring their own little story line too.  Many skills were added while others were re-balanced, mod support is here, and it seems that it can do absolutely amazing stuff, Game-Master Mode is pretty intuitive and easy to handle with a bit of practice, and combined with mod support, I think it's going to allow for a wide range of adventures and campaigns to be designed by aspiring GMs. Overall, while the UI can be clunky at times, it is well designed. I'm especially impressed by how Larian pulled off the controller controls and UI, it requires a bit of getting used to, but it works great. Local Coop is great too, and it means that you can more easily play with friends that could not necesaarily have bought the game. Overall, a fantastic game, that I recommend without hesitation."

Going full initiative makes sure you always get to play first. You can kill all enemies before they have a first turn (on highest difficulty!)  - Obvious huge gaps in item upgrades  - Pickpocketing still way too broken (unlimited gold/all shopitems for free)  - Having 1% magic armor is enough to stop all debuffs  - Enemies too easy to crowd control (stun / freeze / knock down spam)  - Rangers STILL do too much damage (very broken in first game)  - No penalty for poor intelligence / low magic skill. Your spells will always land and you will always have 100% chance to crowd control. You can have a warrior/rogue/ranger hybrid mage. Having a pure mage is such a waste.  - Whole game revolves around the ""teleport"" spell or simular transportation abilities  - TOO many abilities that allow you to escape or move enemies. You can never get hit by melee enemies, and you can always teleport enemy ranger/mage infront of your melee team and just insta-kill them on highest difficulty.  - Almost all of the quests are broken. If you don't do them in the correct order (which means you can't explore anything) you can never complete them. Even the final quest of Act 1  - When you start a fight, your characters run around and position them selves very awkwardly. Even if you pre-set them in high ground etc they will run down and just stand somewhere totally unconvenient  - Sometimes the conversations always end in the same way, no matter what you choose to say. For example; you argue with an NPC. The outcome is exactly the same no matter if you win or lose the argument  - Argument stats (intimidate, wits, intelligence etc) don't matter. If you have maxed out your strenght you will still lose intimidation checks vs. cowards, if that's what the game-designers intended.  CONCLUSION! ? All non-direct damage spells need to be nerfed alot.   ? Debuff vs. magic armor system needs to be reworked.  ? Conversations need to matter (it's an RPG for crying out loud..)  ? Exploring shouldn't be punished by breaking quests.  ? Crafting is totally pointless and needs to be reworked.  ? Pickpockets needs a huge nerf.. since the starting area I have had the best items available to me.    There are alot of things that need improving and changing, obviously it being in EARLY ACCESS. I still recommend the game because I really enjoyed the first one and I know/hope they won't polish this one any less.  Hoping they put alot of effort into balancing things out so I don't feel like a God at level 2 (on highest difficulty);   I will probably rate the game 8/10 when complete (and nerfed)."

For me, this is a feeling that never went away playing Div 2 (though I've only made it up to the end of chapter 2).  Within a minute you meet a talking lizard thing guy who in some very awkward dialogue explains that he is a shipwreck survivor, a former Emperor... ugh.. what else... a fugitive from justice, the sole Red skinned example of his race... a proud and noble warrior or maybe a wizard or anything you want him to be.  At this point I was pretty much certain that this was going to be a boring game.  I don't care if he's Jar Jar Binks, no matter how important and interesting you tell me you are you're only serving to highlight that I've got no emotional connection to anything you say or the world or even any investment in my own character.  So I mechanically criss cross the space completing mini quests in any which way you like, because... that's just what you do in a video game.  Some of the quests were good some are just okay all of them are as familiar as you would expect from a genre fiction setting.  Your character levels up, you learn more about the world.  But somehow there's just no tension at all.  The drama ramps up a little later with talk of all caps GODS, THE UNIVERSE and DOOM.  A hackneyed plot foreshadowing some sort of pick option A through D ending once all the combat is done.  The voice acting was fairly good in parts and the (subject matter aside) written narration verges on great.  But it lacks some sort of spark of excitement or creativity.  That is kinda what I'm hoping for when I invest time in a game.  The combat is complex and something of a mixed bag.   Correct positioning for instance is a crapshoot when most characters can teleport and solid ground can become a flaming oil spill and then an electrical storm in the space of a single turn.  Victory can often come down to whether or not you know before hand what abilities your enemy is likely to use.  All in all I'd give the combat part of this game a grudging recommendation but I've been a long time fan of turn based games.  What I really admire about this game is how sort of 'complete' the game rules are.  Everything that happens in game tends to be consistent within its rule set.  It's not as sophisticated as 2007's Oblivon for example but the game engine is certainly the most excellent part of this game and they even had time to inlcludes cool features like multi and DM'ing... though I couldn't really rate them since I didn't try them."

114,Darxim,122,34,2,2016-11-16,Recommended,498.8,"[Updating review from Early Access]  Almost all of the negative reviews of this game remark that they gave negative review for one of two reasons: 1. Game has too many bugs. 2. Game is too difficult.  That first one is fair.  There are a lot of bugs.  I'm currently not actively playing it due to this.  With this game's ambitious scope, bugs are expected.  Although, relative to a Bethesda game, this game was practically bug-free at release.  The second point, however, is just stupid.  tl;dr: It's not.  When you start the game, you choose your difficulty.  If Tactician is too hard for you, play Classic.  If Classic is too hard for you, play Explorer.  If Explorer is too hard for you, I'm surprised you're able to operate a computer at all.  I started one game on Explorer just to find something out that I couldn't where I was in my game (it was crafting related), and I was killing most things in one hit.  How is this difficult for you?  Honestly, I think it's just people playing on Tactitican because they think they're awesome, then get their asses handed to them because they're not.  I've seen people claim that Act 1 is impossible on Tactician.  Keep in mind that people had already beaten the entire game on Tactician when these claims were made.  If you want an easy game, I would say that this game is not for you, but Explorer mode is available, and it is a really good game, so you should probably still play it.  Another complaint I've seen, although it's rare, is about the level bloat.  I agree with this complaint.  There is way too big a difference between one level and the next, and the steepness of the curve makes it a lot worse.  The game would be a lot better without it.  I can understand the power increase from leveling being on a curve, as that's normal, but the curve is too damn high."

This is a very traditional D&D styled RPG. This means that there'll be a lot of reading, a lot of exploring, puzzles and the game is generally quite difficult if you don't pay attention. As an older gamer this is a massive throwback to the games I played as a kid, but if you're into hardcore non stop action games this is not the game for you.  With that out of the way, if you're an RPG fan and you love getting lost in a ????ed up and amazing world, this is the game for you."

As much as I love the combat system in this and the previous D:OS its surrounded once again by a tedious, meandering plot, and annoying, unlikable characters.  What's worse, is that there are simply no advencements in game play.  The once promised day/night cycles once again failed to appear, NPC schedules are still absent, and everything just feels like an add-on to the first, instead of a true sequel.  I can't say its a bad game, it just brings nothing new to the table, and has no real reason to exist other than to justify another Kickstarter. (which I was hopeful enough to back)  Maybe something new or spectacular will come along in EA, but the mechanics feel pretty set at this point, and they simply fail to amaze.    It is noteworthy I guess that their elves manage to out-ugly TES elves by a shocking degree. The lizard people are no prize either.  Character designs in general are simply badly misconceived.  Oh, and the control collar bit they start the game with is lifted in it's entirety from Dungeon Siege 2.  They didn't alter it at all. Even the models used look almost identical. "

On that note, play the first game first, it's great, and if you like it then come to this one. The two big notes I have about this game are that it's dumb you can freely respec, and tactician mode is a major dissapointment compared to tactician mode in the first game. It's predominantly just an enemy stat buff (+50% to damage, vitality, and armor) and that's about it. It's most just artificial difficulty for if you played the game through a few times and want to have it challenge you again.

62,Johnny_Devo,150,86,4,2017-01-01,Recommended,236.1,"When I first got this game, I was immediately assaulted by an array of limiting areas, tough enemies, and hard fights, to the point where it felt like I wasn't allowed to do anything except a very strict railroad of easier enemies in order to progress. It made me start to lose faith in the game, because it seemed like there was only an illusion of freedom.  But then I got good. After floundering around in my first save file for a good few hours, I sat down and made a new character, applying everything I had learned. I made a focused character. I scrounged for every piece of armor, clawed at every possible avenue and advantage, and I applied the very tactics that destroyed me in the first playthough. It didn't take long to learn that if done right, the game is just as impossible for your enemies as it could be for you.  What I was rewarded with was knowing that there are, for example, several different ways to complete the first area. It's not a railroad; I just, to put it blunt, sucked. In fact, after discovering my first way though that beginning area... I went back in, and starting clearing out enemies, starting in order from most managable. It became an arms race of beating the lowest enemies I could find, surviving the encounter, and assimilating any loot I could find, up to and including the paintings on the walls.  Then, I come up to what I'll call ""midway"" through the first act. Suddenly things are falling into place with the plot, and I'm gaining hints of what appears to be a really neat story in the making. The varied things you can encounter kept my interest once I had the skill to progress, managing gear was interesting due to the magic armor and physical armor differences, and limited resources forced me to make interesting decisions every time I came across a nice piece of gear in a shop.  I began to learn of the various advantages and disadvantages inherent to different styles. Spreading your points can mean you have access to a ton of powerful toolbox abilities, but don't deal much damage. You can focus all your points into one aspect, and that character will be a high damage monster, but will lack in utility in comparison. Pair two such characters together, and your high damage will punch through the defenses of your victim, then the utility monster will knock them down for a turn, only to be put in the ground for good by your high damage character's second round.  Essentially, what I'm saying is if you find yourself overwhelmed by this game like I was at first, I suggest you attempt to absorb what the game is beating into you, then try to use that to beat it back into the game. If you can manage that, the varied builds and playstyles as well as the interactive battle system may just capture your attention.  Overall, this game is already something that I would consider great, and they're only in early access. They're still working on the game and the story, accepting feedback from the forums, and they're doing it well. Worth the full price now, can only get better from here. Would recommend."

The game, upon release looks and feels incredible, and yes - there are a few bugs, but with how immense this game is, it's really nothing I wasn't expecting.  ALL of my previous ""Cons"" have been resolved as of release. There is legitimately nothing bad I can say about this game, it is one of the best games I've ever played, It's equal to (and sometimes greater than) Witcher 3 in almost every respect.  This game is one we will be talking about for years to come, it's an instant classic, and if have even the slightest enjoyment in tactical combat and deep RPG gameplay, this game is for you.  That's all i'm going to write for now, I have more of Rivellon to explore!      Update 1: It took me approximately 30 hours to finish the entirety of the first act (Note: I left some side-quests unfinished, and this involved few deaths.)  My pros and cons remain unchanged, but i would like to throw out some more things i noticed.  This game has more challenging combat that D:OS EE, I found that even on the ""Classic"" difficulty, the combat encounters were on-par with (If not slightly easier) than playing on tactician mode of D:OS EE.  If you thought D:OS was too easy, this game improves on that quite a bit.  This game also has more decisions for your character to make, and even this early in EA you can see where they intend to take things.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   22 Hours in, still not finished with the first act, this game was worth the purchase even during Early Access.   Pros: * Polished Feel * VERY descriptive dialogue * Challenging Encounters * Entertaining Spells * Divinity Game  Cons: * Beginning is quite difficult, as the game doesn't explain where you should go. But this was present in D:OS Classic as well. * Leveling up doesn't feel as fun anymore, since you only get one ""Talent"" every 4 levels (This includes talents for Sneak, etc.) * Party dialogue system is unfinished (Early Access)   On the whole, This game managed to pull me in just like D:OS Classic, and i look forward to many more hours in rivellon."

While it has some issues, for Early Access it has a level of polish unheard of in most games that aren't yet fully released (and also some that are).  The systems seem well thought out, 4 player multiplayer is a massive improvement, the game looks quite lovely not even just in raw graphics but more importanly in visual design, playing as the Red Prince and picking the most Vegeta like dialogue just to see what happens is funny to me, the combat is fun and just challenging enough, these are all good points in the game's favour.  But. There is but one thing that draws me in like a moth to a flame. I have never seen such levels of freedom and sandbox design in a fantasy RPG before to the extent where there's just so much room for player dickery. For example, my friend would start conversations with NPC's like some kind of Strangey McWeirdo who actually wants to advance the plot instead of committing petty crimes for even pettier reasons (I know right?). So, while he's talking, learning story and lore, and just generally enjoying the writing I decided to ???? him over for a laugh.  Even outside of combat you can sneak as long as you don't enter an NPC's Line of sight, and the NPC's sight was focused on my poor friend and not her valuables and I. Needless to say I made off with her shoes, a potion, and some fish the last of which i sent to my friend's inventory as they were still talking. One (what I can only assume to be magical) cavity search later and my friend was in prison while I was grabbing many, many, crates all of which sell for 1 gold to get my pants back after a guard took them from me the last time I got busted for petty theft.  10/10 Would have a kleptomaniac episode again."

To support a game/franchise that you love     A1. The early access community might be the most toxic community I have seen in ANY early access (yep, that includes you Creativerse! AMAZING!). The developers have no interest in actually moderating and things are being tossed around in the forums that would get you perma-baned in other forums, let alone a soft ban... How is it supposed to work? A) Someone posts suggestion B) People agree or disagree civil like, possibly being a simple as +1 or -1. What shouldn't happen? Fan boi's rush into any thread critical of any aspect of the game and proceed to destroy not only the suggestion, but more specifically the person giving the suggestion (AKA Alinsky rules for radicals, ad hominem, ect) People have been reported multiple times and nothing has been done. I will leave below links of threads with this happening if you care to see for yourself. If you want to buy into the early access for this reason run the other way.  http://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/142261352659532710/?ctp=2 http://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/152391285462768446/  Also, another side note would be that Larian does not intend to take ""player feedback"" and change the game based on that in any degree. They have a road map and are doing what they set out to do, nothing more nothing less. If you are buying into the Early Access you are purely playing as a ""bug finder"" in which case Larian should be paying the players, not the other way around...   A2. DOS:EE was one step forward two steps back and three to the side of DOS: Original and DOS2 is following the same path. If you loved DOS you might like DOS:EE and you could possibly even like DOS2- but are the games similiar enough to support purely because of this now? No. The game is changing at a rate that frankly you don't know what you will have at release and supporting the game purely from a franchise view point is beyond risky.   Bottom line is that if you are in group one don't waste your time and money. If you are in group 2 don't take the risk (you can only play act 1 which is only 10-20 hours) and wait until the game is fully released and it is clearer.  EDIT: Once again in another EA game people are reviewing a game based on what they ""hope"" the game will be and not what the game is currently, while ignoring the community and input-giving aspects entirely... Those are literally the only reasons (as I point out above) why you would support a game in Early Access and currently the game is not worth risking an EA buy in- wait until the game comes out and read some reviews at that point in time and make your choice then."

I'm not sure why that's the case, but I'm going to assume Larian Studios thought it would be better to reinvent the wheel instead of implimenting a feature from an old game into what appears to be the same exact engine (just more aesthetically pleasing).  On that note, the Larian Studios has been largely unresponsive to inquiries on a local splitscreen feature for months.  ----------------------------------------------------  UPDATE:  I'm aware they intend to implement controller support and splitscreen coop functionality to their game.  They're not giving us updates as to when to expect that.  I am rating it negatively because it currently doesn't support it.  Their assets are prettier, their menus are probably more intuitive, but the engine is largely the same.  It certainly shouldn't warrant having to wait this long for controller support, even as an Early Access game.  I bought (and got a refund) for this game because I assumed it would have these features.  I mean, this game uses the same engine they refined to support this.  I don't buy into the whole, ""We'd have to keep fixing it after every update"" or ""We just don't have the time.""    I just want them to say, ""We decided to waste time and resources to rebuild a new engine that does exactly the same stuff. (Reinvent the wheel)""  Don't get me wrong, I fully intend to purchase this game when it has these features.  Besides, it's not like I can't just change the review when splitscreen coop and controller support is implemented.  This game will be a blast when it has these features.  --------------------------------------------------  UPDATE (2/7/2016):  I'm deleting comment that are formatted like this:  ""You must be [ad hominem] because no splitscreen.  Herp derp they can get away with whatever they want because Early Access! [ad hominem] [ad hominem].""

This is fine for me but you are currently only able to access the first act. There are plenty of bugs to be worked and features not yet added out as you would expect from an early access pre-beta release. That said, though, the first act is A+++  D:OS 2 is a  turn based RPG based on gear, skill points and abilities, elements etc. A strategic game for sure. This was exactly the sort of game I was looking for and expecting as I was a huge fan of the original.  This game manages to capture what made the original great and expand on it in so many ways, with the ability depth, more grim story and great style (even when running on a potato).  There are plenty of features still to be implimented (such as local coop) as one would expect from an early access release. That said, however, you can be at ease as this is a company that has illustrated clearly in the past that they deliver big time on any promises made during the development period.   Overall, if you're looking for a strategic, turn based RPG look no further."
140,Shit Stain,441,19,0,2017-01-25,Recommended,83.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 improves on almost everything gameplay wise from the first game.  No longer do you have to deal with unfair elemental damage and debuffs that one-shot you, instead there's a new armour system that blocks this kind of damage more reliably, both physical and magical. This new system makes it so you manipulate the battlefield to your advantage more so than just spamming out CC spells on the enemies.  Combat is a lot smoother as they are both extremely aggressive but at the same time tactical as you aim your attacks. With the new armour system you will rely more on throwables and the environment to lower the opponents armour so that you can start controlling them with stuns or burning them.  A new addition are dialogue checks which are similar to the checks present in old isometric Fallout games where your statistics determine your ability to have a successful persuasion chance. Be careful who you use to talk to certain NPCs as now the checks are decided by your main stats and not only your persuasion stat.  Now the game is out of early access I really have to commend Larian for creating a fantastic game. They changed a few of the early fights so that they aren't too broken but at the same time switching it up enough to still make it challengeing. The new additions of polymorph skills and generous placement of source as well as tons of crafting recipes really shows Larian's commitment to making an amazing game.  Never before have I marveled at the magnificence and brilliance of an RPG as much as Divinity: Original Sin 2.  The freedom, progression, story and overall game mechanics makes this one of the best games I've ever played."

Even in the Early Access phase this is already more polished than most games are 3 months after official launch.  The game itself: It's the original + improved and better in every single way. Graphics look great and the engine is very well optimized (already). The combat and progression system is very well done and fun. Multiplayer even better integrated than the original. Storyline and characters are interesting and well written. The music, I absolutely love it. Affordable.  Even if you fear the Early Access tag, just buy this if you're into this type of games at all, you won't be disappointed and you'll actually be supporting a developer that delivers and makes games for the gamers, not for mass revenue. (Of course they're a business in it for profit too, but there's a difference between 45 euro for a full game and 60 euro for a game with 10 strategically placed holes for paid DLC, pushed into release with game breaking bugs. Larian Studios actually ditched their publisher and switched to crowd funding because they forced them to make and launch the game the way they didn't want it, that should tell you enough.)

It mainly pushes the player to build a team with only one damage type to break through shields faster.

Half the battlefield can turn into poison at that point. And if ANY fire attack so much as touches that poison it turns into nether fire that CAN'T BE REMOVED, WON'T DISSAPEAR AND HURTS LIKE F***.

There are a lot of issues with early level encounters being too based on enemy moves to really be ""fun."" Some classes seem virtually unsable at the beginning of the game, for example if you choose wizard and take the fire spells you are recommended to choose you are essentially useless in most early encounter as enemies are 100% resistant to fire damage and plague damage actually heal enemies (a mechanic carried over from the original, but not implemented until a character has enough economy or experience to buy different types of wands for different situations). 3 hours into the game and I have only gotten plague wands which makes me feel useless in undead encounters or a certain set of slugs. Also, the campaign is very ambigious as to what you're supposed to do, and with the dialogue not being voiced reading endless text for hints that you cannot access after exiting paces the game very slowly.  I love D:OS, but I urge fans of the series to exhaust the first game prior to buying this one. While the multiplayer allowing you to play with three friends instead of one is a huge selling point, I would still heavily recommend the first game. 4/10 currently atleast as a first impression. Potential to be as great as the first D:OS which I believe is a terrific game. Currently, not worth the 45$ in my opinion."

I rate the game a 9/10 with the multiplayer a 5/10.  This review will be mainly on singleplayer gameplay, of which i have player over 24 hours during the writing of this review and i will try not to spoil or touch the main story, quests and puzzles.           Gameplay 8.7/10                     The gameplay, much like it's predescessor, is a turn based RPG a la classic fallout and in my experience is much faster paced than fallout and Divinity: Original sin. The difference in gameplay from Divinity: Original sin is that the action system is more compact, some attributes were replaced to make things more simpler, defence from physical and magical attacks as secondary ""health"" bars instead of %reduced, a character past system that gives you new dialogue, and that the dreaded rock paper scissor persuasion system is gone. Many sees the changes as a double edges sword as it removes the more familiar aspects of the game, but to me it was very easy to learn which may have been the intent of the studio and you can take this as a negative or a positive.      Dialogue and persuasion system   10/10   Better than previous system in my opinion  The player dialogue changes i very much appreciated, especially the removed rock paper scissor system, the character past dialogue is interesting and suprisingly incredibly useful as you can get minor help from NPCs, an example would be ""MINOR SPOILER""  in the cave there is a lizard who sells physical weapons, armor, and spellbooks that will give you a minor discount for having the soldier tag  .      Combat Gameplay   9/10   It's different though not much better than the previous system in my opinion.  The gameplay and combat is still quite similar to it's predescessor, but much more fast paced and flashy, especially the new source magic though some of it can be underwhelming. Many of the combat changes seems to be based around the new magic and physical armor system, particularly the damage dealt within one round of combat seems to have been bumped up by a lot both NPC and playable characters compared to the older system.  The difficulty around the armor system can sometimes be glaring because magic, to me, is a much greater threat than physical attacks because of the almost ridiculous amounts of dangerous magical effects that enemies utilize like  poison, stun, fire, frozen, and curse  compared to the physical debilitations,  cripple, knockdown and in rare cases bleed  being the most dangerous physical ones. The good thing about the new system is that as long as you have the type of armor the effect/element affects the debilitation will only be applied when that armor bar is fully depleted, though some can see this as a negative since i actually liked the willpower/bodybuilding system.  Physical combat is still a very good way to do focused damage on one particular enemy, but is more devastating on one with little to no physical armor as  a well placed  barrage of arrows and melee hits can dispatch those enemies very quickly, though the same can't be said for monsters fighting against the playable characters unless the players are underleveled, but a proper and well built team can still kill enemies 3 levels higher than them.      Attribute changes   7/10   Simplifying things doesn't mean better, this is a good example. Worse than the previous system but is still okay in my opinion. The attribute changes to me are weird, like dr seuss weird, wits being too good with it affecting initiative and perception, constitution does not affect anything other than health, memory not affecting anything other than amount of spells (in my opinion it should affect some dialogue or something out of combat), and intelligence, having the same problem with memory only affecting combat and spells with no change in dialogue or out of combat stuff, strength is still heavily affecting combat very useful for throwing and lifting stuff and other out of combat stuff but is still overtaken by telekenessis, finesse only seems to affect combat and theivery, all in all the attribute changes are pretty wonky compared to the previous game.     Multiplayer   Drop in 3.1/10  oh boy.    Organized 10/10  I've not played organized multiplayer but i can see it being incredibly fun. I've only played multiplayer once and it was drop in multiplayer, and first impressions are the most important especially for new players. There are very little controls for the host of the game, for a game based heavily based on teamwork and tactics there is no voice chat from what i can find, the kick function does not work properly because a player can just rejoin particularly trolls and greifers. A help bar and proper command console/tab for hosts can help tremendously, adding a function that ban players from the server, and an option for local voice chat can help drop in play by a lot.  "

I've been burned by alot of Early Access titles before but I'm really happy to say Divinty: Original Sin 2 blew me away.  In terms of gameplay the combat was just the right amount of difficult (classic difficulty) so that I had to really think about my actions and not just go on auto pilot and auto attack, but not too difficult that I had to read guides on how to beat a certain boss or encounter. The puzzles and quests were engaging enough that I didn't blow through them and forget about them, but not too complex or long that I was completing them simply for the sake of moving on.  There were a few bugs such as certain skills failing to registering but seeing as this is an Early Access game I'm not too worried (In 19 hours of gameplay skills only failed to land 3 times).   If you enjoy RPGs you'll love this game. I'm not a big fan of turnbased games, I simply get bored because I feel no connection to the characters in top down turnbased games, but, like Xcom: EW and XCom2, DoS2 seemed to make all my concerns about turn based games fade. I truly felt invested in the characters and felt like I was in the middle of the action, cheering when my glass cannon rogue pulls off an insanely reckless but satisfying attack. The game truly elicited some genuine reactions from me. I got upset when my mage stupidly pulled aggro and laughed when a massively armored knight failed to land a killing blow on me because he slipped on some blood. It engaged me better than some AAA First person RPGs did.    The story was well written for the first act, and leaves you hungry for more. The NPCs are enjoyable to interact with and the relationships they have with the PC and his party actually make sense.??????a trader off enough he/she will stop trading. Steal from someone, you have to return the goods and get back in his good will before talking to him again.   The graphics are nice and the UI and controls aren't annoying. The AI is smart and for the most part doesn't get in your way. You just have to watch out for the sight lines of hostiles. The AI party members tend to stick very closely to the PC but if you're trying to squeeze past a narrow space they may accidentally walk into hostile sight lines triggering a fight. That's a very nity-picky problem that can easily be solved by watching out for your party better.  The freedom that this game gives you in actions and choices really is unparalleled.  I reccommend getting it now and enjoying it, but even if you wait I believe every RPG fan who wants to really feel immersion should get this game.

421,Lorraine,58,25,1,2017-04-09,Not Recommended,647.3,"I like this game, but until its finished, you should just wait. Otherwise you will; A. Lose all saved progress everytime there's a patch until the game is released. Its currently an Alpha, not Beta. B. Get frustrated at the gap closers -every- opponent has (if they have one, then they have multiple). This makes tactical positioning and forethought a wasted effort. Once you get through that level range, (I've seen this behavior more than once) then opponents go back to normal.  The game is definately worth waiting for and you should wait for it to be released as a finished product."

Of course there is the odd bug or two since the game is still in Early Access, but none of them have prevented gameplay.  40+hrs played and multiple classes played.  Finished Act 1 with 2 other friends and Lohse. Loving it so far and the inquisitor class is by far my favourite.  A few of the fights took us multiple attempts but in the end we managed to beat them.   Absoloutely reccomend and cannot wait for the full release."

1536,Greendetective,47,2,0,2017-04-30,Recommended,127.9,I was very skeptical about this game.  How can a top down SRPG not be boring?  But after some persuasion from a friend i finally decided to buy it and play it with them and lo' and behold i was astounded by how fun this game is.  The puzzles and battles are the most strategic and amazing srpg battles I seen with environmental destruction being an awesome gimmick. The story is simple yet effective with a huge world with plenty to do and graphics are amazingly beutiful.  I was never bored playing it.  It will be amazing to see this game get finished and voice acting added(which is in the orginal Divinity).  But for an early access it does give you a good taste of the game and you can tell the finished product will be great.

Right now it seems the publisher is just cashing money publishing an alpha version of the game which is far from being fun to play. Content needs to be further developed and tested before this should be released to the users.

Some fight take multiple attempts and really cheesy tactics like deploying rogue in the back of a boss with all buffs and then initiating the fight :D Also you have the next lvl of making advantage of elements, especially of your blessing skill which seems the most important one in the game, eg. fire which can transform fire into holy fire.  The graphics are INSANE like every log on a bridge is placed separately.  So all in all the difficulty is a no go for the description ""Story Mode"" since the last fights are ridicolously hard but i absolutely recommend this game after release :O"

Made so many weird, bizarre builds, and somehow... They all feel balanced, they all work, and they're all perfectly acceptible ways to get through the game. So I'm getting creative. I want to break this perfect system. I'm sure there's a crack... somewhere.  Next goal- the wall build. Build a character who can hold a lot, have them drop it all in a wall formation, use that to hold off melee attackers.  Wait. Every class has a teleport skill of some point. And the melee class sets things on fire when they use theirs.  CURSE YOU LAHRIAN STUDIOS!  I didn't mean it. Big fan. As of my first time this game. (Still in early access and all. Calm down guys!)"

My original thought's going into this game was that it would be the same as every other, with progression gradually getting easier until I reach the point that I would have no problem killing everything, but no matter how hard I tried I constantly had to redo some of the fights, to really learn the tactics and how the game works. The game exceeded my expectations by far and I would definetly recommed this game to any fan of dungeons and dragons, especially with the new game master feature comming out soon, this could very well revolutionise D&D as we know it."

And even though it's in early access there are not that many bugs around, sure you'll run into one sooner or later but it's usally a minor inconvinence.

92,Lyra,55,29,1,2017-05-11,Recommended,411.4," If you enjoyed the first part, you will love this one!   After playing the first act very thorough here are my highlights!   Combat:   Strategic and creative combat just like in the first game  Combine the skills you value just the way you want it  Combine skills and spells for devastating Combos (make it rain, turn the water into poison, set it on fire and cause a massive inferno!)  Overcome challenging adversaries  Use diverse statuses to deal with superior forces (stuns, freezing, burning, poison, slow, petrifried) while using others to help your own team (Rested, Fortified, Magic Shell, Haste, Regenerating)  BUT BEWARE your opponents will use this very system themselves to put an end to your adventure   Story:   Play as a Sourcerer, individuals capable of using an ancient force known as source which attracts the Voidwoken, monsters prone to ending the world!  Start as the ultimate underdog! Be a prisoner in ""Fort Joy"" a place where they herd sourcerers to ""cure"" them and try to break out while wearing a collar that surpresses you using source!  Pick a Origin! Be the noble Red-Prince, the mystical Lohse or the vengeful Sebille! (and maybe others that might come in the future)   OR  Make your own character and customize him/her with the new Tag-System! Are you a Scholar and an Outlaw ? Or maybe a Barbaric-noble kind of guy? It's for you to decide! These tags offer unique dialogue options and influence the way you expierence  YOUR  character! And your followers have tags of their own making them even more alive!   You are godwoken chosen by the gods to do great things!  "

1040,johndoe,18,2,3,2017-05-12,Not Recommended,88.1,"Camera zoom/navigation is very strange and difficult. You have to manually pan the camera, and/or use the mouse to move, but the camera doesn't follow behind your character like in typical RPGs, but above and at weird angles, so sometimes you can't see where your character is facing, and you have to manually pan the camera to see what's ahead. Graphics themselves don't seem that bad, but the entire game feels like something you would expect maybe five plus years ago. There also isn't any audio/narration to speak of apart from generic background music, so there's a lot of reading in dialogs, like an old Gameboy era RPG. I like the exploratory options available, but....it was impossible for me to really get into the game, and fighting/combat felt weird, even in Explorer mode. I had tutorial mode turned on, but it still took a lot of googling and trial and error to figure out how it's meant to work.  ---  Edit: Came back to the game after Early Access, and I still hold to my previous points about the weird camera and controls. Still, after struggling with it for a while, I kind of got used to it, though it still isn't as immersive as I'm used to. The game itself is kind of addicting in a mindless kind of way (e.g. investigating stuff, choosing the best armor/equipment and skills, etc for tactical purposes).... but somehow it's not really as immersive story-wise as I would like... Still, it's not as bad as it was before; takes some getting used to, but you get used to it after awhile. Some aspects of the controls (e.g. the tactical view/aspect of it) reminds me of Dragon Age Origins, but it's just not as immersive so it's hard to connect with the story/characters. Even when I set auto-zoom on dialog start, the zoom angle is all strange and cuts off part of the character's head. In general, the camera and movement controls are just strange... but the game does grow on you after a while. The ending is very disappointing though, and there are parts that just don't make sense. It was mildly entertaining while it lasted, but I left feeling unsatisfied. I probably won't be replaying it again anytime soon."

1694,Gary Ginderhal,188,2,0,2017-05-14,Recommended,71.8,"Fantastic gameplay, even in an alpha state. That's the short of it, the long of it is a little more complicated.  This game's got a lot to offer even in an extremely unfinished state as it is, and I'll probably change my review when the next story segment comes out and likely again when the game's released as a finished product. As it stands, without voices, with missing dialogue, with missing assets, and occasional bugs, this is still a beautiful game that, while short, offers some pretty in-depth character customization, even up to level 8 or 9.   The elemental effect/terrain altering magic from the first game is back, and better than ever, with a few new combinations, as well as the Bless/Curse quasi-elements that can transform an already dangerous fire patch into a lethal Cursed Flame that sets enemies or allies aflame with immolation that can't be put out with water, or transform an annoying but avoidable oil patch into Blessed Oil that fortifies allies instead of slowing them, making it a detour you WANT to walk through for a buff rather than a hindrance to walk around. I constantly found myself wondering how best to use my action points to turn terrain to my advantage rather than simply cluttering up the field with dangerous patches of fire, ooze, or electrified water.  Creating characters is even more in-depth than the last game, and many of the old skills from the first game have either been changed or removed for more interesting ones. Summoning is now its own skill tree, and is best paired with spells that create environmental effects, or simply on a Lizard who can breathe a patch of flame wherever they want, as the summons, a totem and an ""Incarnate"" gain the element they're conjured on, either water, fire, poison, oil, or blood. Even with all the spells at my disposal, I still found myself favoring the weapons I'd chosen before, as even with a hundred spells at my disposal, sometimes it's nice to just smack someone with a big sword.  This game can be very, VERY hard, but often in a Dark Souls way. Usually you'll know why you died, and can reload to try to fix it next time. Enemy casting a lot of fire spells? Make sure to purchase a rain scroll or use more water magic to counteract them, or simply stunlock the enemy to death and try to pick apart the enemy's strategy. It's pretty rare that you'll encounter a fight that you simply cannot win when you first encounter it, unless you go into the battle extremely underleveled (If you're more than 1 level below your opponent, you're probably going to lose). Generally fights last a while, so make sure to prepare for both long and short combats as it's rare that you'll go into a fight completely outclassing your opponent, and be prepared to burn potions and the like, as they WILL give you an edge in combat and it's generally not worth trying to tough it out without them. There's apparently an entire mechanic for food, but I've never gotten good results from it and the buffs generally arent worth the action points it takes to eat it, so you can't simply down six cheese wheels to heal to full.  The storyline's not quite as good as the gameplay, sadly, but I'm pretty confident that with voice acting and some tweaks it will get far stronger. The quest journal's still hardly worth looking at unless you've totally forgotten what you've done and feel like looking through a complicated and user-unfriendly transcript of everyone you've ever spoken to. The journal could definitely use a change as it was often hard to maintain who's quests were what and with four characters with FOUR SEPARATE JOURNALS THAT OFTEN HAVE SEPARATE QUESTS it's quite difficult to keep everything straight. Thankfully it's easy to just start walking in a direction and you'll probably run into some enemies that are either your level or much, much higher, leading to a quick-reload and a different path taken. The storyline itself introduces a number of people, Dalis the Hammer, Bishop Alexandar, a blind elven seer, and far, far, FAR more, each with a complex backstory that almost everyone's happy to narrate to you at the drop of a hat, which can get a little overwhelming sometimes, but it's an inherently wordy RPG, so that's just par for the course.  The story's tone is classic Larian, with a serious and epic plot that tries to be grim and po-faced when the rest of the world is made up of goofy talking skulls, riddling rats, mad witches, puns, and adorable dog quest-givers. Although the main storyline ends up looking a little out-of-place, it's nice that it's there and that the game's not simply a permanent comedy routine. I will say that some will find the tone kind of schizophrenic, and although I'd agree with that I'd also say that it's not a game to be taken seriously, and is instead more a sandbox for one or more players can wreak havoc or play within the rules.  Character customization is a little lacking at the moment, but that's almost secondary compared to the great animations each race/gender has, as well as each armor set looking different on each race, with an emphasis on eastern cloth for Lizards, or a hardier iron look for Dwarves. Spells have intricate and impressive effects, even for basic spells such as ""Throw a rock"" or ""hit someone extra hard."" While the hairdos and facial options presented to each race and gender is pretty small, it's generally enough that you probably won't get your characters confused.  On an entirely different note, the game's graphics and representation is amazing. I love the vibrant colors, and beautiful tropical locale for the start of the game. The one big downside is that the first part of the game takes place in a giant prison, but the atmosphere is that of a tropical resort, with sunny skies, beautiful coral beaches, and a shanty-town that looks more like a run-down tourist town than a brutal gulag for wizards. Although it wouldn't be nearly as pretty to look at, it would have been nice to have a more oppressive environment to start in, and escape to the tropical paradise later on, for contrast. That being said, the shadow effects playing off trees and logs, and the drop dead gorgeous beaches make for an impressive opening, and when the future chapters of the game are released, I'll be most excited to see the environments they take place in.  To sum it all up, this game is ????ing fantastic. Worth a look if you enjoy slower-paced RPGs, even though the storyline's only about 1/3rd complete. With almost all of its flaws coming from being an unfinished alpha and very few coming from the actual design or gameplay. Pretty much fun in every aspect, with an insane level of combat and character customization depth, this game is absolutely worth your time."

The journal could definitely use a change as it was often hard to maintain who's quests were what and with four characters with FOUR SEPARATE JOURNALS THAT OFTEN HAVE SEPARATE QUESTS it's quite difficult to keep everything straight. Thankfully it's easy to just start walking in a direction and you'll probably run into some enemies that are either your level or much, much higher, leading to a quick-reload and a different path taken. The storyline itself introduces a number of people, Dalis the Hammer, Bishop Alexandar, a blind elven seer, and far, far, FAR more, each with a complex backstory that almost everyone's happy to narrate to you at the drop of a hat, which can get a little overwhelming sometimes, but it's an inherently wordy RPG, so that's just par for the course.  The story's tone is classic Larian, with a serious and epic plot that tries to be grim and po-faced when the rest of the world is made up of goofy talking skulls, riddling rats, mad witches, puns, and adorable dog quest-givers. Although the main storyline ends up looking a little out-of-place, it's nice that it's there and that the game's not simply a permanent comedy routine. I will say that some will find the tone kind of schizophrenic, and although I'd agree with that I'd also say that it's not a game to be taken seriously, and is instead more a sandbox for one or more players can wreak havoc or play within the rules.  Character customization is a little lacking at the moment, but that's almost secondary compared to the great animations each race/gender has, as well as each armor set looking different on each race, with an emphasis on eastern cloth for Lizards, or a hardier iron look for Dwarves. Spells have intricate and impressive effects, even for basic spells such as ""Throw a rock"" or ""hit someone extra hard."" While the hairdos and facial options presented to each race and gender is pretty small, it's generally enough that you probably won't get your characters confused.  On an entirely different note, the game's graphics and representation is amazing. I love the vibrant colors, and beautiful tropical locale for the start of the game. The one big downside is that the first part of the game takes place in a giant prison, but the atmosphere is that of a tropical resort, with sunny skies, beautiful coral beaches, and a shanty-town that looks more like a run-down tourist town than a brutal gulag for wizards. Although it wouldn't be nearly as pretty to look at, it would have been nice to have a more oppressive environment to start in, and escape to the tropical paradise later on, for contrast. That being said, the shadow effects playing off trees and logs, and the drop dead gorgeous beaches make for an impressive opening, and when the future chapters of the game are released, I'll be most excited to see the environments they take place in.  To sum it all up, this game is ????ing fantastic. Worth a look if you enjoy slower-paced RPGs, even though the storyline's only about 1/3rd complete. With almost all of its flaws coming from being an unfinished alpha and very few coming from the actual design or gameplay. Pretty much fun in every aspect, with an insane level of combat and character customization depth, this game is absolutely worth your time."
1446,Tyrvali,91,2,0,2017-05-15,Recommended,201.8," Divinity: Original Sin 2  So, Divinity: Original Sin 2...  I have to say several things about this game before I properly review it. 1) It's in early access alpha at the time of review. 2) Only Act 1 is available, alongside an Arena mode. 3) I loved Divinity: Original Sin  Ok, so, for people who loved the first one, this is a must buy. Even at its current stage of development, which Larian Studios are constantly working on and updating, this is amazing. I have played through the first act as several different characters.  Each playthrough has been similar and different in unique ways. For example, I tried to playthrough the game as a solo Elf Cleric.  The Voidworm fight was nearly impossible for me . I then tried a proper playthrough, using a full party. My character was a Dwarf Rogue. Not only are the classes and races completely different, the combinations of combat were entirely different and I loved it.  I will not lie, however. To people who A) haven't played Divinity: Original Sin, it could be hard to get used to, despite the tutorial help boxes. B) Some elements of the story can break. For example, if Gavin dies before making it back to the camp, you cannot progress in his quest. Note: This is not a game-breaker.  Overall: Since I loved the original, I purchased this game early into its alpha. So far, I've loved every minute. I can't wait for the full release of this masterpiece. Thank you, Larian Studios!  UPDATE: With the full release of the game, I am extremely excited to keep playing. Starting an undead elf character was the first thing I did. I am almost done with Act 1 at the moment and have discovered so many quests, characters and items I previously had no idea about. There are so many things to do and many quests to complete. The cinematics and introductions are a nice touch."

They're all fat with this ugly armor to wear. The hair styles aren't much better unless you're trying to save yourself for Jesus.  Original Review:   Seems interesting, it's been a few months since I played it now. I enjoyed the short amount of time I had with it but there just weren't enough role playing elements. It all felt like that sort of moment in 2.5D isometric games where you accidentally cross some arbritrary line and that turns a bunch of people (like a bartender and school boy and his mom) into enemies  because earlier you were told don't come closer but you didn't know which character was speaking and you're surrounded by characters so any direction you move could be 'closer'."

I like it so much, I bought the original Divinity just to give me something to play pending complete game release in September.  Thanks so much Larian Studios.  This is one of the very best Steam purchases I've ever made.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  :)  Update 9/17/2017:  Now that game has been officially released, let me add that the voice acting on finished game is great.

Divinity: Original Sin 2 is not only a deep and meaningful game of tactics, exploration and puzzle solving, but also a master-class in dialogue and writing that shames Original Sin as if it were the work of a child in comparison.  Quests with meaningful choices and justifications, thought-out and deep skill combos that affect your playstyle and experience in combat, a surprisingly intriguing and not at all by-the-numbers story and absolutely NO handholding.  Everything that is great and wonderful about character driven RPGs is here and fleshed out,  I believe I've finally found the game that will let me retire from reinstalling Neverwinter Nights again for good. The only thing I wish they had done is let you roam the entire world like in Original Sin; the chapters are separate areas. They provide ample warning before you leave an area though, so it's not like it's a frustrating mechanic!  There have been complaints about the difficulty of not only the combat but also in solving the puzzles; If you're struggling to solve a puzzle it's because you haven't found all the clues; they're always there somewhere. if you can't beat a particular enemy because he's too strong you're gonna have to come back to him later. The game won't coddle you, you're supposed to learn how to defeat different enemy combinations through hard work and experimentation! The game is equal parts merciless and forgiving, enlightening and mystifying, challenging and fun.   A must-buy, and above all else; we must have a sequel, Larian!

This game shines in multiplayer  The handful of little annoying bugs and glitches are completely and utterly outweighed by how captivating and enthralling this game is... And it's still in Early Access... I see a lot of complaints that the story isn't long enough, or really focusing on the bugs, lets get real.  Bugs: - Sometimes your helmet will blink and flicker a bit - Sometimes your characters won't be within range, or have line of sight on a target they clearly should - Accuracy percentage seems to be a bit off, 80% chance to hit is more like 30%; anything under 90% is trouble That's... About it...  Story is too short? Well then play the rest of the game kid. You can speed run the ""story"" in like 20 minutes if you wanted, the real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do. I honestly can't believe how good this game is for an EA release and I can't wait for the full release come September. Could not recommend highly enough.  Things I would like to see in future: - More races. - More in depth customisation options for spells and abilities. Think Champions Online or the Oblivion Spell-Creation. (asking for a lot, I know) - A little control over what armour looks like on your character.  - More spells, more synergy between spells. This is already great, but why stop at great!

I have had no issues with the game at all, and even alone the voice acting is keeping me playing. Feel free to check some valid negative reviews for problems that will most likely be fixed. And remember, there is always the option to reload to rethink and plan. Lets hope this stays constant through the game.  Ok, the Quest Log is broken as mentioned alot. And I found a couple of bugs.  The devs are working to fix problems, but they just do not have enough people to find all the bugs. I am 100% sure the game will be fleshed out within a couple months.  I also have heard that act 3 is kind of broken in a way, which I will experience myself. So far everything is beautiful and feels good, the graphics, audio, story telling, companions and all the other stuffs. As someone who enjoys smething and goes back afterwords to see everything, this will be a great experience.    Early Access review: Before you buy: Please go play atleast some of the first game if you wanted to play this. It is finished so a new player can enjoy the full experience. I have just been reading people complain about the early access too much to ignore this.     Oh and I very strongly recommend getting a friend to join you (There is a 2 player pack I pretty sure if you are feeling generous.) Without a friend that you can enjoy playing with,the beginning will be a struggle as it is a bit misleading.     Also the game is difficult in a way that makes a person have to think critically, making a restart is inevitable unless you are either a master at these games or just have played it a while. Having another person to talk to about positioning and cc (main points of the game) really makes a restart less frusturating and more of a learning experience until you get into the groove.  If you get this game I seriously hope you enjoyed it as much as the first one. Although I haven't beaten it completely I have enjoyed every step of the teleporting mess that it is.  Also. If you can only buy one get this one. Both are really great though"

I have tried to create a character 3 different times to no avail. The best description i can provide of the game crashing is my whole computer would freeze in C.C. (there is no specific point during C.C. that makes it crash, its just being in C.C. for too long casues the game to crash after a few minutes). I cant Alt-Tab, CLTR -ALT-Delete, and the only way to respoind is by doing a force shut down of my computer. After rebooting my computer the PC will then persist in going into a seemingly endless repair boot by constantly restarting. I would then pull the plug out of the outlet and wait for 10-15min and try again where it will reboot successfully.

If you're looking for something to play with friends, this is a great game for that too. You can have a party of 4 players total, so why not bring three pals to accompany you on the perilous journey ahead.   Have no friends?

Una volta abbandonato fort joy col tuo party, quel party ti rimane. gli altri personaggi non scelti vengono eliminati o comunque non sono recrutabili. Male a mio avviso, nel capitolo precedente potevo completare le storie di tutti i personaggi , qui no. Questo limita anche il volere creare un personaggio del tutto nuovo nuovo. se i personaggi principali della storia sono 6, e il party contiene al max 4 pg, se creo un personaggio ex novo non potr vedere la storia di ben 3 personaggi principali. vale la pena quindi usare i personaggi ""efabbricati"". grave mancanza a mio parere, se lo fanno per farmelo giocare pi volte , per me non ha comunque senso.  La trama PRINCIPALE non  all altezza del gioco.  piuttosto banale anzi, anche questa mancanza grave, che sposta gli equilibri da ""olavoro"" a ""ottimo gioco"". poca roba direte voi, ottimo  ottimo. NO, perch capolavoro  capolavoro.

Ovvio che alla lunga viene da saltare alcuni di questi dialoghi, e rischi di trovarti a non capire il proseguimento della trama.

When this basic aspect of a tactical combat game is so totally arbitrary and senseless, it makes combat feel totally stupid, unbelievable, and unfair. Even if you win, it just feels stupid."

Friendly NPC characters agro against you after the battle is over, even if the fire/poison etc. they are standing in, is of their own making.  I have tried to keep several NPC's alive through fights only to have them turn against me during the conversation that automatically follows combat because they have taken damage from fire. Few other smaller issues I have noticed, occasionally characters abilities are greyed out during battle, quick save and reload seems to fix this. Random teleport bugs, you click to move and one or more of your characters instantly moves to another location far from the rest. "

201,Nether,23,28,0,2017-08-07,Recommended,212.9,"Im super excited for the release date, if you're into Dragon Age or RPGs with turn-based combat, Id /strongly/ recommend it.   This is the first of the DOS games I tried, but after trying the alpha, which Ive spent 30 hours in (of the ""suggested"" 8-12 hours), I went back and played the D:OS 1, I was genuinely surprised to see it was a decent game, but also realizing that it actually is lightyears behind this one, D:OS 2.   It doesnt have the live combat, which DA has, but its turn based where the attack time is based on your characters' strengths and weakness' (for lack of better simplistic explanation) - Id personally take the real time action over this one, but it still seems to be well-made.   I think its a bit deceiving with the main character's customization, as the characters you find throughout the game can matter just as much, if not more. Only benefit is a bit of options to change the look. Additionally, I think its a shame you can swap the discovered characters in between different ""conflicting speccs"" as you find them, as in, mage OR warrior and not just pick between whether you want the warrior to be in a defensive or aggressive build - it ruins a bit of the RP feel of the characters in my mind. You could have the option to swap between the conflicting paths, but then you should get a RP story explaining why that it is a possibility, and only have it as a rare trait to some of them. If you're playing on high difficulty, having this would mean you directly need to find a healer/tank/rogue to unlock certain skills/benefits.   Im lacking a bit of character story and overall story, which you can find in the early Dragon Age games, but it hardly affects my belief of the game. Im excited to see how the late game develops, as Im afraid you get overpowered a bit too soon, in addition to the fact that the cookie cutter builds seem to be a bit too either overpowered, or obvious.   One thing I actually spite, is the fact that the amount of discovered/hidden ""legendary"" weapons are slightly too many, and of too high importance. If you're playing on max difficulty, you're almost forced to google to find them, in order to being able to beat the NPC/AI. Atleast this is the case if youre in the range of my skill-level, which admittedly isn't perfect.   Everything I could think of on the spot, September cant come soon enough."

658,markharris31,165,54,12,2017-08-12,Not Recommended,155.9,"The game isn't all that fun, honestly.    Pros: -Game looks great and plays well.  Runs very smoothly especially for early access.   -There's a wide variety of skills, skill types, and weapons in the game. -Dialog so far is interesting and well written.  Story seems pretty interesting. -Characters in general have their own personalities and agendas, with some witty lines.  I have a few minor gripes with the characters and npc interaction, but overall I think characters are a definitely a positive. -Ability to change the class of joining characters is a great idea.  It wasn't there in early alpha so I'm really happy to see it now. - Animations are actually quite good, armor and weapon designs are thoughtful and race specific.  Aesthetic is impressive, honestly. - Environmental interaction and ability to combine spell effects with the environment is a very cool concept  Cons: -Prepare to spend hours trying to beat a single pitched battle with minions, let alone boss characters. -It's easy to create characters with absolutely horrid efficacy and no way to back out of those choices.  -The important set pieces have you either outnumbered (think 10 on 4 at times) and/or ambushed.  Normally this would be fine, since your characters will have skills and abilities that can get you out of said situations.  However, since in most ambush situations all enemy characters move first, you can easily find yourself stun-locked to a quick death.  Multiple rounds of just watching your stunned/frozen/knocked down/crippled/diseased characters getting ripped apart by enemies with a variety of debuffing skills that require no cooldown is just flat out boring.  That's not a battle, it's not a game of chess with the enemy, it's not preparing and having skills that can counter enemies (since of course removing a debuff with my 5 turn cooldown skill means nothing since 6 enemies can just re-stack the debuff next round).  It's a boring slaughter.  -Twenty minutes into a turn based fight, when a single enemy with 2 HP can stun 3 members of your team that have full armor that should resist the debuff, heal itself, and then teleport away all in the same turn, that's a problem.  Then proceed to restack the debuff every turn while you just sit there watching and have no chance to counter or do anything at all (since entire team stunned for 3 rounds each time enemy attacks).  It's just not enjoyable.   Overall: -I want to love this game, and I think there are some really cool mechanics to it.  But I have a life outside video games, and spending hours trying to find the right combination of strategy and luck to win a single fight is not something I have time to do.  I enjoy a good challenge, I just don't have 500 hours to put into a game just because I get ambush/stunlocked into death over and over again.  That's really not fun."
875,wjkchn,32,6,1,2017-08-13,Recommended,87,"By and large, the game is fun and fantastic without taking language barriers into consideration. Buy it now without any hesitation if you do have time to enjoy the game slowly and you are interested in traditional RPG with turn-based battle mode.  The amazing game scene also defeats DOS1 and most of the other similar RPGs. Can't wait to play full version which will release on Sep.14th.  Besides, The story line in this game can be decided or changed by the player. HOWEVER, as a Chinese college student passed GRE and TOEFL recently, it is still a HUGE BURDEN for me to understand what the dialog is mainly about. It need great patience to play this game with an e-dictionary app. Hence, I frankly request Larian to take actions to prepare for the CHINESE version now if that is already in your wait-list plan. If you find it too hard to make Chinese version, please try to find a local game translation team, they might be happy to work for you in a quite reasonable price.  Again, I highly recommend this game and I shall go on to expand my vocabulary. (haha)"
2,Lost Sinner,79,518,12,2017-08-15,Recommended,"2,780.10","? One of the best cRPG out there, if you are a fan of roleplaying games, this is definitely a must buy. For those who never play thier first game, no worries, although they take places in a same universe, each has a standalone story. This one starts thousand years after the first one so you are not missing anything.  ? One of best thing about DOS 2 is it gameplay. It's turn-based, slow-paced but really interactive with many different elemental combinations, cool interactions between each abilities and your surrounding environmental even statuses are interesting.   For some examples you can create some nasty chain explosive reactions with a combo of Fire and Poison, any kind of liquid (water/blood/poison/...) left on the battleground can reacted to Air turning it into a pool of Electricity deal damage and stun anyone in it.    Buffs/debuffs status usually do more than one thing and may interact with eachother, Stone Armor not only increase your physical armor but also stop you from bleeding/burning because you are solid rock. Peace Of Mind is the kind of ability that let you see a bigger pictures, it provides stats buff and cure Blindness BUT also remove frenzy status Rage, because the target have become more wise so no more bold actions. Rage on the otherhand is also another status which increase damage output but at a great cost of defense down.   Surrounding environmental also plays a great part in your game, say if someone go invisible and there is happen to be raining, that sneaky guy will be revealed because he's wet. And because water react violently with electricity, he will be taking increased Air damage but will take less damage if you throw a fireball at him. Walking through frozen ground and you may trip and get knocked down. Standing on high ground will make your spells/abilities/items reach further with increased damage. ? Talents in game open up your playstyles depend on what you pick. Lone Wolf or One Man Army does what it says for who want to go solo, Leech turn you into a vampire allowing you to heal when standing near blood or Zombie make Poison heal you instead but normal healing will damage you. Because the game is classless , you can be anyone , mix and match anything you like, you may be born a warrior but dream to be a mage, go learn some magic and become a battlemage. Who says warrior can't be sneaky, go ahead and get yourself some rogue abilities...  ? Divinity Original Sin 2 also offer you really great roleplaying experience, it has a great balance between combat and talking with rich dialogues and occasional silly humors. You can play as different races: Human , Elf , Dwarf , Undead and Lizard..yeah thats' right, you can become a Lizard that spits out Fire. Each races have different racial skill and special power, NPCs may also react/talk differently to you depend on your race. There are also different original characters ingame who have thier own story, goals and personalites for you to play, but if you want to create your own character, the game also offer many different origins which called tags: Soldier, Scholar, Outlaw,..etc which plays a part in dialogue. The Origins will remain in your game as companion and you can have different perspective on them through dialogues/questline which is really cool imo,  there is also a relationship system ingame (not fully included in EA , will be in full game) which can create intense rivalry, friendship, enmity and romance!  ? Visually, the game looks great, it's colorful most of the times and can be dark when needed to be, infact the DOS 2 is meant to be darker and much more focused than the previous one. Having finished Act 1 in EA, there are no fetch quests and unrelated to the storyline, all of them is connected one way or another, each tell you a story about the game's world and ultimately leading to a bigger picture. You can finish quests in different ways , any path is a progression, you'll never feel getting stuck, there are always different paths to take, things to do. Oh a maze, i'm not in the mood to solve puzzle atm, let's jump/fly through it, dont have wings? Look around, there's maybe some other hidden paths/shortcut or go do some questline maybe some of them will shed some lights of the Maze making it easier to go through.  ? Crafting is in game (duh..! obviously, it's an cprg game) and it's RICH. Just look up the crafting list in DOS 1, and  before there were just a combination of two items, in DOS 2 you can have a combination of total 5 items. Here comes the great part, you can craft new skills by combining books of different schools. You can turn a normal rain into a mean blood storm. Mixing a Pryo spell with Necromancy, you can make corpses explode dealing massive damage to nearby targets as if you cutting thier buddies down wasn't enough..  ? There are alot more cool features ingame but i won't include them all in this small review. So i'll add one more thing that may get some people excited: There will be a Game Master Mode! which have up to 5 players in total which include 4 main players and 1 GM. Allowing you to create your own worlds and adventure with friends, the devs also offer alot of tools for easier time making your own dungeon, you can control anything, the stats, the weather, music, dialouges, events,..etc and you can even do it on the fly! You can take a quick look of the mode here (a GM Mode game hosted by Matt Mercer)  ? If you are interested in some gameplays, feel free to check my videos: Honour Mode Walkthrough "

I don't go a single moment in this game without being mesmerized by how fantastic it is.  I'll list some pros:  -Beautiful art style, everything looks amazing.  -Combat that is both simple and incredibly difficult at the same time. After two-to-three encounters the player will have a good grasp of how combat works, but throughout the entire game they'll be learning new ways to manipulate the environment and their abilities to play better.  -Fantastic writing, honestly amazing.  -Perfect soundtrack, every sound and song in this game is so perfectly adjusted for the situation it's seamless and very immersive.  -Highly addictive, once I sit down to play I'm practically rooted to my chair to continue.  -Companions you'll care about, it's the tragedy of lesser RPGs that your companions are boring and lifeless, but here, everyone has their own ambitions and goals, and WILL pursue them.    There's very little wrong about this game. Previously I mentioned that voice acting won't be included which would be a con to some, but in a complete surprise Larian have voiced the entire game, despite the fact that was never planned throughout development.

It becomes a series of boss fights until it just ends with a boss fight.    - Certain talents/classes are kind of useless compared to others. Taking bartering is without any meaningful point, because with/without it you will acquire a hoard of gold and be able to steal everything anyway.

Despite Early Access being limited with content release, voice overs, maps and skills, the game has still successfully impressed me, there are so many variable options that allow you to make the story fit to your playstyle, you can so choose to go about quests however you choose....i.e if you need a key to save someone, you can pickpocket the person who has said key, instead of follow through with their demands.....and similar like things, combat is fantastic, the reconstruction of the AP system is amazing and works brilliantly, the way you memorise skills for fights and have the option to use any  combination of weapons you want is also a really nice touch. I personally find that the start can be very off-putting to players perhaps seeking a more casual playthrough, simply because good gear at the start is hard to find and it takes many hours to sift through enough quests and objectives and even area's just to progress to a stage where you feel ""comfortable"".   The only bad point that comes to mind after playing just under 30hrs, is that combat seems to be heavily based on a need to be the same or higher level than your opponent, I have found that despite having fairly good gear, if an opponent is even 1 level infront of me, the battle is very challanging and any hits you land seem to do very little damage...where as if I return, being the same level with the same gear, I can breeze through them, I am unsure if this is just early access stuff or the way they have chosen to go about combat.  Overall, I recommend both, they are extremely fun with friends and fit a varying style of game types like a mix of rpg and rts, stealth...all out, magic, melee, archery.

It has all the strenghts of the first game`s Enhanced Edition, offers turn-based combat and plenty elemental interactions (make it rain, aoe stun through blitz bolt - create a fire surface, throw poison onto it for a huge explosion etc.). You can play with up to four party members and can either create your own character or take one of the four (after full release six) pre-made characters. While the first game lacked in the story, this 2nd part is much better in this regard. It has a much darker tone and so far the story delivers fully. It is grim, entertaining and really complex. Also the possibility of party dialogue and getting different results when talking with different party members to certain NPCs enlagerns its richness in this regard. But the strogest point of Divinity Origial Sin has always been its combat system. And the second part adds more features to that and makes everything even better. You now have aroumr fore physical and magic damage, which you have to break first in order to inflict status elements like stunned or burning or knocked down. Also there is a height system now, that your ranged characters can use for greater range and more damage.  And last but not least the game has after the full release on the 14th of September a Game Master Mode. There you can basically develop and play your own adventures with the Divinity engine and UI. With this you can create your own D&D - campaign and play it with your friends.  Another small feature is the Arena Mode, where you can explore the combat system with pre-defined characters on several maps. All this features offer easy access to multiplayer, I have atm ver 250 hours into this already great game and multiplayer worked fine every time. I regard Divinity Original Sin 2 in the highest order. This game was highly enjoyable already in its year in Early Access although it missed some of its features.

I'm 16 hours into it on the challenging playthrough setting and I've hit a strange and unusual wall in my progress. All of the fights are too difficult and there are no additional ways for me to get experience to level up to be able to progress through the fights... I can't say I've ever ran into this before.  The fights themselves aren't any fun either. 90% of the fights will go as follows... Your group walks into a fight situation in a tight grouping. The fight starts, the enemies will have the initiative and they will immediate start hitting you with AOE nukes that you can't avoid because your group insists on entering the fight standing two steps apart from each other. There isn't any way to adjust the grouping, initiate the fight with a single member or avoid the AOE.   Playing this game is like repeatedly being forced to walk into a trap you can see coming from a mile away.   There are some other issues also: completed quests aren't removed from the quest log, map markers don't show up on the mini map, difficult navigation through the game. Overall this game is an easy two thumbs down."

Above was my first review and opinion when i played the game for the first few hours, everything seemed to work, looked/felt amazing etc. But finally i realized how flawed the ""new"" combat system was. It is horrible compared to the old one from DOS1. Less tactical and strategical options by FAR and on top of that unfair/unbalanced encounters who really prefered some playrole above others, again and again. Well i love that Larian Studio put so much effort into the game and enhanced it on most aspects above the old DOS1 but the combat..the combat system ruined it for me. As much as i want to give it a like, i just cant because i got more and more frustrated by it the longer i played."

Which was challenging but a lot of fun. The game was a sand box. You coud go anywhere. Great graphics. Voice actors. Every spell was fun to use. Exploring. Stealing was fun.  So i resisted for a while but finally decided to take the plunge and buy the sequel. This game. And lets just say you cant make a masterpiece twice, It would seem. This is quite the opposite. Different races, bigger landscapes, flashier looking bad guys. But this is where all the trouble is.  you get lost in the linear landscapes. No longer can you freely roam the realms. you can only level up by following the extremely restrictive story, which is hard to follow because of the poor graphics. The combats are more about flashy graphics then any kind of balance. One fight in the arena comes to mind. A simple quest to get you from a - b. every time i start the fight. i get auto blinded in the first turn have to chase all the bad guys up and down ladders barely being able to return fire because blind everytime. we had probability in the first game. And chasing enemies up ladders because it looks nice climbing a ladder doesn't make for a fun game and hardly seems anywhere near as tactical as the first game. Just one silly action after another in this game. And im not even on the hard difficulty yet. This games good as a coaster. altho an expensive one. bigger isn't always better."

Playing this game is like reading a book, except it's sluggish book that you have to stop for a minute every time you turn a page.  I run up, talk to an NPC spend 5 mins picking/reading all choices , he tells me what to do, I spin around to head towards objective, have to adjust camera cause I cant see the door(half the time my view is obstructed by a wall or structure), and  once I can see the door, I awkwardly walk/run as the movement feels glitchy as my character randomly stops/starts running, and I try to get him through the door.

The problem I have with it is similar to Divinity 1.  It is too easy to find yourself locked into absurdly overlevelled areas with no way out other than to load a save.  I spent nearly an hour reloading save after save trying to find a hole to thread the needle of my character.  Then there are the issues with the companions.  Do NOT use a premade character, if you do, then you won't be able to recruit that character, and the only characters you can recruit are the premades.  So if you use a premade character you may find yourself unable to fill your party.   There's a lot of other stuff that is interesting, the combat mechanics are...unique for this kind of game, and I like that.  And I also like the elemental stuff working together, although it becomes a bit too much of a cruch later on, so that it's not some unique trick you pull from time to time, but everything exploding everywhere constantly."

The sounds, and music are part of this experience and I can't really describe how calming the sound of waves lapping on the beach is, or how tense the screams of a sadistic tortue chamber changes the atmosphere of the game.  Sound and music are excellent.  Full voice acting for all characters really encases you within the immersiveness of this world.                I've enjoyed 100 hours on the first Original Sin, and 150 hours on the Enhanced Edition, and the gameplay that made that game such a success has only been evolved and molded into a what can only be described as a masterpiece.                  I'll start with the simplest form of gameplay: Combat.  While simple in essence, the amount of possibilities and ways to approach every battle give the combat in this game replayability and makes it never feel monotonous.  You will find yourself planning turns ahead, baiting enemies into a tighter space, saving AP and waiting to spring a trap on them- just for your enemies to do the same to you.  Early access only has access to a ""medium"" difficulty, and as a veteran of the series I can say that while it isn't a walk in the park, it won't require too much out of a well thought out party.  Character planning and preparedness make the difficulty in my opinion, as starting battles differently will show you that a battle that you may have once thought very hard, can become very easy if starting it out thinking outside the box.  Picking up that oil barrel you saw way back, carrying and sneaking it into the middle of an enemy pack, sneaking out, and opening combat with that firescroll you have been saving since the beginning of the game is just one of the many ways you can make the game easier for yourself.                While the game rewards thinking in that aspect, one of my favourite things about this game so far is that it DOESN'T reward you traditionally.  A talent ""Pet-Pal"" will let you talk to animals, and you may expect that every animal you talk to should give you something in return, by nature of spending a hard-earned talent point on the ability.  While sometimes that may be the case, more-often than not you are rewarded with a thought-provoking sentiment from a creature that is just trying to survive in this crazy world.  Consoling and replacing an orphaned bear's parental figure, or trying to explain to a dog what death means won't give you EXP or skills, but will tweak your heart-strings and remind you that there is nothing you can't expect in this world that larian has created.                The story of this game is interesting, as it will be very different depending on who you are playing as, or who you are playing with.  6 Origin characters each have their own goals and will play the game according to their needs.  And even if you aren't playing as them, they will continue throughout the world trying to accomplish their unique goals.  And woe be to those that will stand in their way.  Will you help them or turn them against each other? Or pursuade them to join you?  Or use them to as a means to an end to find better treasure and kill them when their usefulness has run out?  The characters are vastly improved upon the first game and out of everything, this is the part of the game that is the most improved and the most exciting for fans of original sin.                The only thing I can reccommend to players both new and old is that you really try to do EVERYTHING.  If you think it may be possible, just try it out.  What does 10 points in telekenisis and a really heavy object look like over-top of the enemies head?  Sneaking Pacifist playthroughs?  A character that lights everything around them on fire, then has their fire spells reduced in cost because of them standing on fire, and having so much fire-resist that they are healed by standing in it?                  The replayability of this game is insane because there are too many viable options to discover and explore.  The best part about it all is that you can play with 3 other people and do it all together."
921,Dimmie,192,4,0,2017-09-05,Recommended,136.2,"28.8 Hours on Record, and that's how long it took me to complete the full Fort Joy & Swamp areas.  I know the early access is missing a lot, which only makes me want this game more, and more with every passing minute- especially after watching the developer video speaking about the playable undead (Undead being my favorite race in most any game I've played).  28.8 Hours on Record, and there are STILL things I haven't fully figured out, still quests I feel like I left incomplete. Still things I think I might be able to do, yet I couldn't figure out the answer.  For the early access content (Which I assume is not even close to what they've gotten completed right now), I was more then satisfied. I was seeking a create your own character game with an in-depth story, with some lovable and quirky companions, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 has scratched that itch.  I cannot wait for the full release and will likely try other actions and combonations on the side. And the fact that I can just get Lohse & Ifen as my companions and I'm not shoehorned into accepting anyone else pleases me beyond belief- It allows for some fun immersive experiences.  I want this game to be out so very badly, like the full release. I yearn for it and I'm giddy with anticipation- Couldn't recommend it more, especially for someone who has been craving a create your own character and a LOT of story driven content.  --------  I've decided to put a bit of an edit into my review.  Mostly to make a comparison of the Alpha version of Divinity Original Sin 2 and the Enhanced version of Divinity Original Sin- albeit I've only gotten 14 hours down on the first game.  First off the Character Creator:  (Divinity Original Sin, Enhanced Edition/The First Game) The main difference for me in regards to the character creator is the characters pasts. I'm someone who likes to feel immersed as the 'average jane' sort of character. A nobody, so needless to say in the original Divinity Original Sin game, I wasn't exactly fond of the backstories the customizable characters were given. The Source Hunters were established ""Bad Asses"" so to speak, no matter what class you picked there was a backstory explaining exactly how skilled they were.  There was no build up to your characters esteemed position. You were a Source Hunter, you're both well respected and somewhat hated/envied. You could be this rogue who was caught doing a job, a knight who was the last survivor of some kind of knightly house, a Witch that actually faced off against the Source Hunters until the 'Leader' asked for your assistance. Although each little back story was beautifully tailored, it left me with a feeling of: ""These characters are woven, personalities set.""  Which in turn, made me feel like if I replayed the game.. Although there are differing dialogue choices, decisions, and options.. The past of the Customized PC's makes it feel as if I'm just replaying the same people. (Mind you this is from my perspective)  (Divinity Original Sin 2, The Alpha Release) The Alpha Release is not the final product, so this portion of the review may change. However, from the most recent streams Larian's shown the public, it seems that the customized character is far more 'Pastless'. For people like me this is a fun immersive/roleplay aspect. I can, as an example, play a character who semi-leans towards the Magister's methods and refuses to use Source, and believes that locking away Source is the best course ofa ction. Although I doubt it's possible to keep the collar on the entire game (Something I will try to do on full release), it is still something I can mold as a 'past'.   I could throw them a background as a Soldier and a Scholar, I could go with the idea that they lost a loved one to the voidwaken when my character had first used their source abilities and that is why they refuse to use Source any longer. Not only that but each dialogue option doesn't make my character out to be a bonafied badass. As a simple example, if I choose the Soldier background and meet a certain NPC with a soldier background, there is an option to salute them- the salute feels like it implies that my character was beneath the other characters Rank. Whereas they once commanded, my character was merely a grunt.  There is a lot more growth from an immersive self-RP perspective, a lot more variety I feel. Though once again this is a personal opinion!  Companions:  (Divinity Original Sin, Enhanced Edition/The First Game) I've only met three companions in the first game, the man in the library, the locked up wild woman, the veteran source hunter, and the thief. Now I haven't really dealt with the library man but the Source Hunter & Thief are the ones I run with constantly. They do have the occassional smidgen of dialogue (perhaps this branches out later in the game, this is just me talking from a 14 hour period, which is half of what I played in Divinity Original Sin 2 to complete the alpha areas). However I don't feel.. Very connected to them, NPCs refuse to talk to them and would prefer ""Talking to the leader."" sure they may be fleshed out but as I see them they're.. Just nice things that punch stuff. With the occassional quip here and there. I'll likely play more Divinity Original Sin enhanced edition and change this opinion but for now I'm not too interested in the companions.  (Divinity Original Sin 2, The Alpha Release) The amount of love and care that went into these companions astounds me. They feel alive, and that's in the ALPHA of all things. Each is distinct, if someone offhandedly mentioned ""That one character that talks about boats."" I'd know it was Beast, and he isn't even a companion in the alpha!   Another example is Ifen, he is labeled with a tag called ""Villain"" in the alpha, I'm not sure if that will be there on release, but there are dialogue choices he can sue with that tag. It's implied that he's a horrible individual, but if you look at his personality, he is much more the  just a ""Villain"". He stood up for an elf when humans were rabbling her, he does not approve of killing an animal in an area that can be killed because it is disgusting. He's only a villain, because the world has ousted him as one- he's a mercenary, he's infamous, he's feared. But he's also someone who loves animals, someone that doesn't really enjoy bullying others that are 'lower on the food chain', he isn't a fan of senseless killing but kills only because it's his ""Job"". For an alpha, there was so much insane depth to him.  I didn't use Sibble or Prince much, but every interraction with them that I had, made them out to be people. Not a piece of the scenary or a meat wall that was needed to throw in front of swords.  ----  I'm sure there are things the original does better then the second- albeit I've yet to find that out. Some may say the combat, but the combat in #2 feels much more strategetic. I can't just strong arm my way through the combat like I do in 1, quite frequently at that. Perhaps I am just naturally biased, but, I think that #2 beats #1 in all categories. I enjoy both the alpha of dinivty original sin 2, and the enhanced edition of the original Divinity Original Sin.  However, I can find myself lost in #2 for hours (As seen by my 40 hours put in even after completing everything I could at 28 Hours), whereas in #1 I need to take breaks due to growing.. Bored."

It's just a garbage game every way you slice it, horrible story, ?????? graphics, absolutely horrible view so you can't even enjoy the nice models and 10 year old graphics everything is made with.

There's basically nothing new added to the game other than a handful of skills, not even a new class, if there is any new classes i can hardly notice in the character editor, since it rather seems like it's all the same exact??????               Ok, this as of now has now co-op local splitscreen like it claims on the store page, with an excuse that they'll add it later.

It's not even as good as the first one.   If it weren't for the voice acting in this game I'd be insisting on a refund.

Are you looking for basic tutorials and an engaging world of gameplay and story? Well don't look here because you won't find it.  If you enjoy spending hours simply trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing by clicking on every NPC you see to read endless sentences of sub-par dialogue, all the while wondering why some of these very NPC's you come accross have the potential to murk you in 2-3 turns for seemingly no reason, then perhaps this game is for you. But, if that sounds concerning -- as well it should -- do not waste your money on this game.   Maybe I'd be less upset by the sheer mess of this game if it cost $24.99, which I believe is more than fair a price for what it is, $44.99 is far too much to charge for this deplorable piece of garbage. The developers couldn't be bothered to add even a little voice acting into a world where the only way you know left from right is to click, click, click, on every moving thing praying for a clue of what to do next."

I personally feel like the story is not that intriguing, the animations (NOTE: Not complaining about graphics). Some people will complain about time played but it was enough for me personally to realise I would most likely not enjoy continuing and thus wasting more time.  If you're looking into this game and consider buying it you should obviously not go with my comment alone, check both positive and negative ones.

I'm playing on Tactician and the combat is suprisinglt actually difficult.  I've had to restart numerous fights and really try.  The chardev is not good compared to epic encounters mod for DOS1, but is better than plain DOS1 EE.    Crafting was fixed to have minimal impact, which is definitely a great improvement.  I should say so far as I haven;t gotten to a forge.    In general everything I disliked about DOS1 has been improved besides the console children elements which have all been enhanced.  The spinning camera and pixel gunting is just a waste of time filler and so annoying I am leaving the recommendation as not recommended, even though all rpg fans of any but the most consolish and childish type will by this game regardless.  There just aren;t enough actual rpgs to not buy any of them.  But the camera nonsense is a huge dissapointment.  Original review below- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Its like if DOS was designed for a much younger audience with console game preferences.  The only improvements over DOS are sensible character development changes that should have been included in the EE.  But, like DOS' EE the focus on this game is the superficial and what sophomoric rpg fans want.  It is definitely a number of steps backwards instead of the leaps forward it should have and could have been with a budget focused on systems and content instead of spinning cameras, console preferences, and full voice overs."
256,Jayco?,262,11,0,2017-09-08,Recommended,406.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2  is everything the first game was but better and more. There's more options character wise (many different races), more possible outcomes of events and your decisions, more spellls, more everything!      The story is quite interesting, because this time around it seems to be more serious, dark and characters you meet (especially your companions) have their own unique storylines and motives which make you want to learn more about them, understand their POVs and interact with them (very reminiscent of the legendary Baldur's Gate games). After beating Act 1 I'm absolutely hooked and cannot help but wonder how their stories might unfold and what suprises await along the way.  UPDATE: The full game has come out and just as I expected it's bloody brilliant. Made it past the zone from early acces and there's so much to do, so much content that it's overwhelming. Best RPG ever!!!     The combat is more satisfying and rewarding than ever. It encourages creative thinking and approach to your encounters, as well as using the environment to your advantage. There's new spells and spell schools, including summoning and polymorph as well as many additions and positive changes to the old ones. The turn based battles feel a lot more fluid and engaging thanks to many mobility options characters got (grow wings and fly away, charge at your enemies or jump back - there's always an option). And of course You have the option to play the campaign with a buddy or a random person online. There's also a game master, dnd like mode coming which looks very promising. Exploration and experimenting with crafting and such is very rewarding and satisfying.    The audio is stunning, with a remarkable main theme chorus music that I cannot help but to hum to myself as  I wait for full release! Game let's you pick a favorite out of 4 instuments (oud, tamborine, bansuri and cello) the sounds of which get mixed in battle music as well as pivotal moments in your campaign, crafting a really memorable experience.     As far as graphics go they definitely feel like an improvement. Especially the character models and the armor design are gorgeous, where in the first game characters felt small and rather generic looking, with not many visual changes affecting them along the way, this time around each character and race look unique, feel big, present and meaningful in the game's world. Landscapes are beautiful and monsters you encounter look nasty (in a good way) and threatening.   Overall, I am very VERY impressed with what I experienced in the game and absolutely cannot reccommend this game enough. You can really tell the game was made with love, passion and care. (A very rare thing to find in modern games). This is, I swear the best RPG I've ever played."

1322,Gergg,663,2,0,2017-09-08,Recommended,72.3,"An incredible game that promises to be even more amazing when it launches next week.  The combat really stands head-and-shoulders above other classic RPGs like Tyranny and Pillars of Eternity. So few RPGs of any type really manage to make it feel like what skill or spell you're using really matters. In D:OS2 even weak skills and spells can find their place in combat if they can create an advantage. Even the weakest fire spell can turn the tides if the enemy is standing in oil.  Let me share some fun moments with the AI.  I thought I could bamboozle the enemy by giving my main character the Zombie trait. This trait allows them to heal when poisoned but take damage from healing spells/skills/potions. I foolishly assumed that they wouldn't be able to take advantage of that but if anything it made my life harder. So many AI enemies have a basic ranged healing spell/skill, some of which will restore health over several turns. They were all too happy to use them on my character.  At some other point, I was flirting with a woman who was part of a band of thugs. We got along well and promised to meet up in the future. Shortly after that I????????off her boss by insisting that he free my elven kin. In the ensuing battle the woman I had wooed fought against her compatriots in order to help me. She burned alive in the fray and I vowed to take her diary with me for the rest of my days.  In another encounter I was well positioned to stave off the enemy with my tank. The enemy mage saw this and cast a spell on him that swapped his position with a caged demon. I had to spend precious turns bashing the cage door open to escape while my squishy mages scattered.  The game is packed with these kinds of fun moments and turns and those were all within the first couple hours of play. Larian took what already worked in D:OS, improved it, and then fixed a lot of what didn't work. I have no idea how the co-op is but I imagine it will be excellent."

It allows trolls to poison you even if they never see it.  Half the players kick people from open games within seconds for this reason.  (not sure why they have the game set to open in the first place)  Even if you join a game with friendly players you can be left with playing any of the classes at random for a completely unknown amount of time.  I guess my point is the multiplayer in this game is?????? entirely built for trolls.  The single player story is interesting so far, but I am not going to reccomend it due to the terrible multiplayer experience.  I can't see myself playing through the story more than once.  edit:  Lol these comments are crazy.  To the ""play an RPG with randoms people"" Yes I bought the game expecting to play like most other RPGs.  Diablo 3, Path of Exile, even dark souls are all RPGs with multiplayer.  It is not some game breaking idea.  Playing together is like herding cats.  It would be about as hard as getting a DnD group together and much less fun.  No one can play if the host (dm) is not there.  DM can kick and reload games at will.      To the people saying the devs said you should play with friends.  That should be a banner on the main page.  Random multiplayer games are simply not a fun experience.  People should know that.    Please view this game as a solo game or herd all your friends to meet up for an RPG every week.  Edit 2:  For me Steam is simply for buying and launching games.  Ive been on here since the orange box.  If the fact I use steam to play games and not keep a social media game diary makes you want to ignore my opinion then by all means ignore it.    I see that kind of immediate personal attack as a fanboy tactic since you cannot combat the truth in the review.  DOS2 has a terrible public multiplayer system.  If it had normal multiplayer I would see myself playing hundreds of hours, going through the story multiple times on multiple characters, jumping into friends games and playing with them.  Jumping in random games and talking to people and taking a back seat as they take care of (and probably murderhobo) the story.  Instead I will play through the game once more on single player after the release where you are not simply escaping the island to a suddent abrupt end like the alpha.   The single player game is not bad.  Tons of things to do, plenty of side quests, loads of (text based) dialogue which at times was way way too much for simple things.  Easy enough when it comes to stratagies and skills.  Even unexpected feelings, torturing people is one thing, but that poor bear cub :( I tried to revive the mom with a scroll, but couldnt.  I should be able to revive the mom!  Final edit for launch:   The last wave of balancing made the game a lot nicer for single player.  Sadly stealthing really only works well on multi player due to party leashing system.  They should have stolen the solo mode from KOTOR.    If you plan on buying this for a single player story you will probably enjoy it.  If you want hundreds of hours of multiplayer fun and endless replays this game is not for you."

187,Snork,204,29,4,2017-09-09,Recommended,289.5,"If you're looking for a roleplaying game with interesting and useful abilities both in AND out of combat this game is for you.  If you're looking for an RPG with a deep, involved story across multiple characters this game is for you. If you're looking for an RPG where you feel powerful but are also constantly challenged to improve both in skill and level, then this game is for you.  However this game is not for you if you are bored by dialogue, this game is not for you if you dislike complexity and having to actually learn how to play and this game is not for you if you you require instant gratification.  For me, this game plays like a western version of a JRPG, with many characters to join your party, a deep complex story and many ways for you to affect the story.  The combat is turn based which allows for more depth in the combat system and more strategic options.  If you haven't tried turn based combat before, this is a great way to try it.  It's like Diablo but for intelligent adults.  Each origin character provides with a completely different gameplay experience even if you play them as the same class.  Overall, as an RPG, I give DOSII a 10/10 on a curved scale.  Unparalleled in the modern PC market and preferrable to the most recent console offering Final Fantasy 15."

My biggest Con:  - Substantial UI Changes from Divinity: Original Sin that may take some time to get used to. It doesn't always feel like the most natural or intuitive system.  My biggest Pro:  + The storytelling between different characters/companions is always unique. Dialogue options make a difference in how they interact with you, and how the entire game unfolds.   I also love the new classes and spells they've added since Original Sin I.  This game has come a long way from when I first purchased it in Early Access. Back then it already felt like a full game and a fascinating environment that I would be happy to spend hours in, and yet the development team continues to update and polish their game. It just keeps getting better, and more fleshed out as they reach their release date.  If you were a fan of Divinity: Original Sin, you'd be a fool not to give this a try for two hours to see if you like it."

336,Stimwalt | YouTube,194,5,0,2017-09-10,Recommended,184.4,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 Highlights:  -10/10- Best Classic RPG on the Market, sorry Pillars of Eternity.  Although PoE is a formidable competitor in the CRPG industry, it still falls short of Larian's inspired craft.  -Truly immersive and imaginative, you will lose yourself in this world for weeks/months/maybe years.  The dialogue in this game is so well written, I feel like I'm reading a novel with each interaction, in a good way.  -Open world exploration and discovery is highly rewarding and equally challenging, as undiscovered secrets and side quests seem endless, and dangerous.  You happen upon a dirt pile, ask your companion for a shovel, dig it up to find a deep hole leading to something. You enter said deep hole to find a lair of angry and hungry spiders.  You defeat the spider menace to find a man's corpse, and a bloody journal, which leads you on a daring adventure.  Meanwhile, you were already on a daring adventure before you started down this path!  -Customization is extremely advanced, where each and every aspect of your characters' reputation, skills, abilities, and even speech are at your fingertips.  You can easily spend hours in character creation, days in tweaking your playstyles, and weeks/month doing it all over again on separate playthroughs.  -Impressive cooperative Multiplayer that brings an excellent experience to the game.  This is a heavily under-utilized aspect of the game, but if you have friends who enjoy turn-based RPGs, there is nothing quite like working as a team and experiencing the magic together.  It is very remincient to table-top roleplaying, except in a kickass game.  -Amazingly high replayability with options for unique interactions that inspire a renewed sense of purpose.  Even though I only have early access, I have played the game through three times already, and that was just the first Act of the game!  -Obsessive attention to detail with a mastery of storytelling, Larian poured their souls into this title, it's alive!  I rarely say that I love a game.  I love this game.  This isn't a game, this is a masterpiece of design, and I'm very happy Larian has given this wonderful experience to the world. Will you join us?

You can do so many things you can't do in other games my fovorite thing I found out was you can pick ANYTHING UP. I didn't have a lockpick so I picked the chest itself up til I had one and then opened it later. Any NPC can trade with you but some won't take your garbage for their gold which is funny and kinda a nice change. I highly encourage everybody to get the game when it comes out 100% it will be epic and all voice acted. I hope they pick a good narrarator or that system will flop but the level of detail and care in everything I think we don't need to worry.
1115,StolenMadWolf,91,2,0,2017-09-10,Recommended,93.6,"Okay, this review is way overdue, but I wanted to take all the time I need to fully explore this game before getting it up. This proved more difficult than I hoped for a few different reasons and Ive decided just to take what I have got and get this review up now. Because this game deserves the praise. I did a review for the beta, and to be honest, not much can be changed from that previous one. But I will try and do a change up and update.  In DOS 2, you play as a Sourcer, an individual able to use a powerful magic known as Source. Unfortunately for you at the time of the game, said magic has some negative issues and you are persecuted and rounded up for 'curing'. Naturally, there is more to you then meets the eye, and your certainly not planning on sticking around for the 'cure'. This evolves into a deep and complex plot as you go on a quest not only to save the world, but to become the next divine, a form of demi-god. Only thing is, only one of four characters can be that.  Starting off with gameplay, first off, you have excellent roleplaying potential. You can select one of a few origin stories or create your own custom character, with their own origins, starting abilities and tags, which offer additional dialogue options and opens up several possibilities in interactions. There are no classes in the game (the 'classes' you pick at the start of the game only really define your starting abilities, stats and maybe appearance.) which coupled with the simple, but very nicely done customisation system and wide range and freedom of dialogue lets you create the character you want to roleplay as in game. This is especially true with the ability to play the game you want to play it. Be a noble knight? Check. Be an anti-heroic rogue? Check. Kill every sucker in sight for the lols? Well, not everyone so you don't break the game, but check. Which leads me onto the combat. I love it. It's the good old fashioned slow-paced turn based gameplay that is so rarely used nowadays outside of some specific games. You can use basic attacks, abilities, consumables and magic to fight your way through your encounters, or, with a bit of luck, avoid them. You can utilise your abilities and the environment to create powerful combinations for attack and defence and there is a great deal of strategy and tactics to be had, encouraging you to think before you act. When you win a tough battle, you feel a sense of relief and of course, the feeling of being a badass.  Also, unlike many RPGs, especially amongst the older ones and the MMO's, the game is complex enough to make you think and to make you invest time into the game, but simple enough not to confuse you or tire you out and hence allow you to stay immersed. Few games can get that balance right.  Couple the roleplaying and combat together along with companions with different relationship values, and boom, you have the ideal combat roleplaying game ready to go. Even better though is the fact that whilst you can play the game solo, on your own or with a playable NPC party. You can also bring in three other players in on your campaign adventure with their own characters. The possibilities of cooperation, backstabbing, competition, friendship and the occasional bit of griefing or trolling with four human players is endless. All in all, by pure basic gameplay along, its utterly fantastic solo or with a group of friends.  There is a catch to this though& this game can be insanely hard, at least initially. The enemy plays smart and can wipe the floor with you if youre not careful. Once you start getting reasonable equipment, abilities and spells you start to find yourself increasingly able to slaughter your way through most of your opponents& until you hit the bigger fights and the bosses, in which case, you promptly start getting youreeeeekicked, even on the lowest difficulty so be ready to save scum and rerun fights. Unfortunately, some quests and fights can feel just unfair at times regardless of where you are at, so be careful.  The campaign for DOS 2 is deep, complex and gripping, always encouraging you to continue playing through to the end. It has excellent characters and voice acting, coupled in with an unpredictable and well-done story with multiple endings with variations. It certain stands out as a solid campaign with numerous sub quests and side stories alongside the main one, couple this in with a natural inclination to explore the map, and you soon find yourself more than happily working to complete whatever you can find. The storys one real weakness is that it suffers Halo 4 syndrome. Anyone familiar with the series will quickly get the gist of the plot, events and characters, whilst newcomers will be left scratching their heads as they try and get a better understanding of setting. Thankfully, a lot of this is covered as you progress through the game and you will soon get an understanding of the story and setting, which is solid enough to stand on its own two feet. The campaign is strong throughout Acts 1-3 but weakens in Act 4 due to some almost unfair and annoying quests, situations and fights, but the very final segment makes up for it.

271,jimbobslimbob,243,10,0,2017-09-11,Recommended,128.1,"It's a turn-based isometric RPG which attempts to do what Sword Coast Legends never did: make a computer game that captured the essence of PnP, complete with campaign editor (not tried yet, since this is an EA review), GM mode and true RPG-freedom-of-choice. It is very similar to RPG's of old, like Neverwinter Nights, Baldurs Gate etc.  I have only completed Act 1 so far, since that's all that exists in the early access version, but I am hooked. The game is a joy to play. Difficult at times, yet rewarding too. It offers true freedom of choice in the way you play and create your character. It features a classless character system so you are free to do whatever you want with your character. It also features various ""origin"" characters which are kind of pre-generated characters with fleshed out backgrounds (the kind of thing you do yourself in a D&D campaign). You can choose to play one of those or alternatively make up your own and recruit them in game.  There are many ways to solve the quests in game, offering a lot of replay value. Race, ""tags"" (such as Outlaw etc.) all make NPC's treat you differently and offer various other ways to do things. The co-op gameplay (up to 4 players) has also been specifically designed with this in mind, meaning your party may not always see eye-to-eye on things. This creates the potential for some interesting RP scenarios.  Although the version I played does not yet feature a GM mode or level editor, this looks to be the icing on the cake and could significantly increase play-time. They will also offer Steam Workshop support for ""click-and-play"" modding.  Now all they need to do is offer the ability to import/export characters...  Summary Overwhelming to begin with, but once you get to grips with the game mechanics you realise just how well crafted this game is. Gorgeous graphics, wonderful sound and music, solid turn-based tactical combat and endless replay value.  Jimbo Rating: 8/10 "
436,AstroBoltos ?,135,4,0,2017-09-11,Recommended,287.2,"One of the most immersive RPG's I have ever played, although it's only a part of Act I the world in Divinity feels ro rich in life and lore. Playing classic mode is just about right in terms of difficulty the turn based combat makes it super complex, it's both easy to understand but  hard to master. Combat is super tactical you will find yourself struggling to keep your party at bay fighting hordes of enemies. The enemy A.I. feels natural as if you where actually facing a big threat in the dungeons, but it balances out with how good you level up and build your party. There's a bunch of stuff you can do while in combat such as positioning and combining different elements to your advantage but it's still very fun and doesnt feel repetitive. The crafting gets a little confusing, dont know if it's because I haven't found many recipes but through combining you pretty much go blindly into it and expect to get soom goodies such as consumables and learn the recipe.  The decision making in this game is pretty much a big deal, since it signifcantly affects the people you interact with and the outcome of any conversation related to your actions or thoughts. For an early access game its 10 times better than any mediocre regurgitated unpolished garbage on steam.  The Core gameplay will be fighting and looting corpses to get stronger, but you will find yourself with a lot of quests from various NPC'S and sub-story lines. Although I felt a little insecure with how quests didnt show any markers on the map or minimap it is very immersive that while chatting with NPC'S they can pin point a location of interest in the quest if the person you're talking to actually knows about it, instead of just telling you to do something and you as a player just feel like you are going through rails while discovering quests.   The amount of time I spent reading and nitpicking through my journal and conversations was just about right, not too confusing but not too easy, the game really does a great job at treating you as a competent player. While its easy to get lost on objectives and questlines you can always go back to the conversations you've had with your journal. The Soundtrack is Amazing you wont even feel it bothering you when jogging or fighting through the maps various and diverse locations.   Overall I said everything I had to although, I had encountered various bugs but nothing a good checkpoint cant fix and I cannot wait for the full realease. A very good experience for a fan of the genre. I think most people should have a fun time, but its far better when playing with your friends and having a blast. Interactivity with the world and the attention to detail that Larian studios has made is superb, trully a nice gem to be found. I strongly recommend you get this game if you are into gaming in general."

616,Mashed Buddha,160,39,2,2017-09-12,Not Recommended,39.7,"While quite the polished experience, it's just not the RPG I'm looking for.  Did I keep playing the early release content to the end?  Yes, but I just found it to be disappointing in so many ways, and hoped for it to improve as I persevered. (TLDR at bottom)  The story:  Overly dark and centered around death, rotting corpses, gore, etc.  It's tiring and boring.  Then there's all the ""mystic visions"" and ""gameplay"" where you're wandering through some alternate dimension just trying to get out to the real map and explore.  It's such a waste of resources to create these disjointed little sections of the game to jam pretentious god-story down the player's throat.  Combat:  I liked the combat, but ultimately the battlefield is just a mess.  Is battle supposed to be clean?  No, but the combat in DOS 1 was much tighter and way more satisfying tactically.  While DOS2 makes interesting use of height advantages, it's often hard to get your characters into position in time for this to be useful, with limited action points and freezing/crippling/etc spells slowing you down while you cause no damage in return, and usually the enemy is already placed in advantageous spots to attack you from.  This wasn't a huge part of the combat (if at all) in DOS 1, where again, the combat was much better.  For example, the rain spell in the first game was applied to a specific area of effect of your choosing; putting out the fire on your party, or applying it to your enemy only for whatever reason (like freezing chilled opponents).  The rain spell in DOS2 rains over everyone, friend and foe alike, so if you want to electrify the water on the ground, you likely have to take damage along with your enemies, or take away burning from everyone on the battlefield at once.  The camera:  It's mostly okay by itself, although I wish I could zoom out a bit more, and tilt down to see forward sometimes.  But the main issue here is the constant barrage of Tall Things scratching you in the eyeball.  Broken ruins posts, tall trees and hills, ship masts, etc. You'll be battling the environment for the right angles more than you fight the Magisters who persecute you at every turn.  Which leads me to another disappointing aspect of the game: The environments are so hard to navigate.  It's ""open world"" but you'll struggle to find the exact right paths that you're allowed to use while moving around the island, especially while backtracking. Where are the open environments to just traverse and explore?  So many people compare this to Baldur's Gate, yet this has no relation to the open locations found there, or in Fallout 1 , the Ultima games, or even this developers first release, Divine Divinity.  And finally, when Divinity Original Sin 1 was announced, it was marketed as a return to the Ultima style of gaming.  And yes, while you can pick up any fork you see, it's really missing the exploration, openness, and true freedom of those games.  Ultima 5, 6, and probably mostly trying to be reminiscent of 7.  There's no loading screens in those games and they came out in the 80s and early 90s.  No separate locations, and everything could be interacted with.  Yes there was less detail and simpler graphics, but less clutter and more freedom and satisfaction.  What did I like about the game?  I don't hate the combat, it's been fun at times.  Some of the characters are interesting, especially the NPCs who will join you (or you can play as, likely opening other story possibilities).  The challenge of getting out of Fort Joy and having multiple ways to do it, finally getting strong enough to go back and take out the enemies that needed to be avoided initially was satisfying.  I'm sure the replayability in the early game is appealing to some, but I rarely replay games and that doesn't make or break a game for me.  NPCs do react pretty well to the specific character you created (you have [ELF] dialog if you chose that race), and there are a decent amount of skill checks, which I like.  Talking to animals is neat.  Maybe Act 2 improves.  It will certainly be interesting to hear the voices I imagined get replaced by real voices.  TLDR: So if you don't mind my gripes, then all the power to ya, keep playing and replaying.  But if you haven't played the game and are looking for a more open, less cluttered, exploration based game with smarter turn-based combat and a more chill story, then this isn't the game for you."
670,_________?,390,2,1,2017-09-12,Not Recommended,119.1,"Edit: Changed to thumbs down because ""Show me your T*TS"" is a line in this game when you have a female character in the party, and the ""Strange Fruit"" reference when the gods are hanging from a tree...really.  -----  Brilliant so far, given acquiescing to some funky stuff every so often in Alpha.   E.g. how every time I talk to the Red Prince on the beach, his dialogue immediately closes, but only for my main character. Everyone else is fine :)  Have so far played well more time than supposedly this version allowed, but I've completed annihilated all of the magistrates inside the fort, which took a fair bit of strategy to complete.  Which hints on one point of joy; where I can move things around in the environment to block the enemy out and deal with subsections of them. Inside the fort, for example, I set up a small killzone in a side room and blocked out the main door. Then I teleported the main enemy into the side room, took him down, followed by teleporting each enemy back through for removal--seemingly allowing me to take many more enemies on than I would have head on. Definitely a bonus against similar games where you simply go toe-to-toe, as is."

It's combat is turned based, but don't let that scare you away. It really does feel like a dynamic game of D&D.  The strategy that can go into each situation, whether you try to talk your way out or you just go full murder hobo, is really rewarding.  The games only in early access but it releases today. I can't wait to get my hands on the full title. The 11 hours I've played so far have been very enjoyable Every bit as good and in my opinion better than the original.   The addition of 100% voice over in the final game is just a big bonus for anyone who doesnt want to read a lot, although in this game its well worth the read or listen now. If you didnt play Divinity original sin, you missed out, but dont worry it really seems like it is not a prerequisite for the sequel.   There is definitely stuff in there that is remnants of the past game but the events of the game are 1000 years plus in the future from the original game.   I'm really hoping to get to put the game master mode to the test with friends somwhere down the line. The guys and gals at Larian really out did themselves. Talk about underpromising and over delivering. That was pretty much par for the course for this game, and boy am I glad they delivered.   I don't want to give the game a full rating yet, but I'm definitely throwing a positive thumbs way up for what i've played so far and from everything theyve shown us coming on release."

1357,Mahebra,291,2,0,2017-09-13,Recommended,238.5,"Improves on the original in every way.  Original Sin 1 was probably one of the best CRPGs I had ever played to that date, and I could find little to no flaws with it, many of which were improved upon in the Enhanced Edition of the game.   Original Sin 2 somehow manages to take that mastercraft and make it even better, the new systems and mechanics implemented in such a way that I find it almost hard to return to the original. I have spent an absurd amount of time on the Early Access alone, and cannot believe the amount of variety and feasability to the different ways to approach each situation.   I was a bit taken back by the new changes to the armor system -- having physical and/or magical armor protects you (and your enemies) from those CC abilities, which made the first game a bit of a race to CC the enemies before they could do it to you. Original Sin 2 found a interesting way to handle that, and building your team and skillset to tackle this new problem has made the combat far more interesting and more satisfying, while not over complicating things. Instead of a party make-up being almost required, you're now a bit more free to experiment with your set up, and the changes to the skill system allows you to experiment more with being a hybrid build, instead of having to take a strict path in order to maximize gains.  This game seems far more friendly to newer players, while still keeping much of the spice and charm that I've come to expect and love from Larian, and this newest entry has done nothing but please and delight me."

The reason why Divinity always had an asterisk next to it (and why I never finished the original while finishing Dragon's Age Origins probably 5x or so) is because I never got the story, or, to be more precise, its setting. It was always very 1, cringey (Cyseal is a cringy name for a town, please, stop it with the lower class dumb English accents, same patterns persist here as well), 2, weird and scattershot (you'd have Colonial-era boats intermixed with swords and spells-type aesthetic, you'd have all kinds of races in the story with little rhyme or reason), there never seemed to be any reconciled, singular story of the ""world"" as it was, that made sense, like LOTR does, like DA:O does, like WOW does, like all of these pretty straightforward Fantasy settings do, 3, weird (the names ""Divinity"" and ""Original Sin"" always evoke parallels with the Bible, and I don't know about you, but for me the Bible is about as much at odds with Fantasy as anything can possibly be)  So please, whoever is in charge of the franchise, get rid of it. The legacy of the setting is so strong that it poisons everything around it. The ""Divinity"" franchise came out of the Divinity: Dragon Commander game, which doesn't sound like a good foundation to build ANY fantasy epic on. That's not a game to be used as a blueprint for future games, especially in the RPG genre for F's sakes.   Restart the franchise with a setting and a narrative system that MAKES SENSE, because I immediately disconnected from the first game, even though it was STRAIGHT up my alley, just because of how cringy and awful the setting was. And no, you can't patch it up and call it done, get rid of all of it, and start with a map, a world, a few races, a crisis, some supernatural figures maybe, and that's it. Look at LOTR or DA:O for reference. I just can't recommend a game with a story in this disastrous state."

49,iingaate,72,223,3,2017-09-14,Recommended,143.3,"First time reviewing a game, but felt I should on this one. I never did play the first game though heard good things about it, so figured give the second a run. So far...even in early access I can't say I was disappointed. The game it's self reminds me of classic computer RPGs and pen 'n paper RPGs I played when I was much younger just a bit more fair and easier to understand yet still maintaining a lot of what made them challenging. Character customization starts a bit limited but as you get higher in levels its more about what you want to play and what your party members be. You are not locked into your starting class at all and I love that, hoping they have a lot more choices in the full release.   Gameplay wise is point and click, though I found there is a lot to interact with in the world in different ways, one of the more different ways I found was that playing an Elf or having an Elf in your group, the elf can eat a corpse and gain the memories of that person, and it actually does play a part in the game. Combat is much of the same, point and click with a lot of tactical choices to make, the enemy AI is well refined and act in actually very smart ways even on the easier difficulties. I also found it pretty neat how your spells, items and attacks can change the battle ground and make hazards for yourself and your enemies, with the enemies able to do the same. Such as freezing a wet spot on the ground to give a chance of someone slipping on the spot or shocking the water with lighting to stun everyone standing in the wet spot. Though at times at least for me I found it hard to move to avoide these hazards at times like the area they were affecting were slightly larger than they really were.  I even tried a bit of co-op with friends and a bit hidden in a sense once we figured it out, connecting with one another was clean and easy to do.   Storywise I found interesting enough, a dark world with many dark themes with demons, torture and corruption. The premade characters have backgrounds and behave well according to their backgrounds. Another different system in this game is the tag system. Basicly pick tags for your character and you will have in game choices that you can make based just on those tags you pick. The pre mades having different choices as well they can make based on their stand alone backgrounds. Though it does feel you can get same results no matter your background still, it does help with immersion and at in making your created character feel seprate from the rest.   Graphics, are not that important to me, but they are decent enough in this game. Though playing completely zoomed out (pretty much the only way to play an RPG like this) I found it a bit difficult to notice things I could pick up or interact with since they are so small. A few rare times I misclicked on something because of how small it is. I have an older system, so I wasn't able to play on the highest settings, I was able to however able to play on high even though the game suggested I play on low. So I can see pretty much everyone able to play this game with no issues. Even when I tried the highest settings I just had a slight drop in Frame rate.  Overall Divinity 2 I recommend highly, especially if you are a fan of old school RPGs and Pen 'n Paper RPGs, you will feel right at home playing this with a high level of immersion and ability to costumize your character however you desire. Story had been done before but it's presented well in the world, and should be interesting enough to keep you playing. Combat is deep, and will challenge the thinking sides of your brain to approach each encounter in most effective way possible, plus have you thinking best way to build your characters to deal with threats in your prefered way. You might find a little frustration in interacting with the world due to how small things are and will even miss a few things if you aren't careful, but it shouldn't be a big enough issue to remove any enjoyment in the game.   Hope you found this helpful if you took the time to read it."

94,xXSparrow.KingsleyXx,158,162,0,2017-09-14,Recommended,69.4,"DOS II is a herald to old rpgs from the 80s-90s.  RPGs like Fallout, Wasteland, Baldurs Gate.  All of them rewarded you with exploration, dialogue, minute journal-keeping and little to no quest markers.  You relied on your wits alone to get you through the game.  Choices mattered in those games.  If you eeeeed up a quest, the game would make damn well sure you knew it  and felt it.  Unlike most modern RPGs, Divinity is open-ended and not just with classes.  You want to be a magic-wielding rogue?  Go for it.  Pure rogue that steals and kills everything that isnt nailed down or moves?  Go for it.  The choice is yours!  Be whatever mixture of class/skills that you want.  What this game is is a love letter to rpgs of the past and it has little to no hand-holding.  Pros: + graphically one of the most beautiful CRPGS I've played.  Varied enviroments, painstaking details, vivid colors. + Written dialogue is very well done - characters have stories they're willing to tell + the story is intense; it leaves your morals confused and often conflicting + Incredible customization for characters.  Skills, weapons, attributes.  This really is a game that harks back to working your character out + Challenging.  This isnt your mommas half???????RPG.  This game WILL kick your?????if you dont play your cards right + The world is massive and rewards players for exploring and roaming + Multiple solutions to quests.  There isnt one way to do everything.  Find one solution you like?  Quest on!  Find another way that suits your fancy better?  Game on. + Graphically very pleasing to look at! + Music is what youd expect from a fantasy game and its pleasing to chill out and relax to + Party members are interesting and have their own backstories/quests + Multiplayer/Co-op! + Option for fast travel when you discover waypoints + VO's are nice but I'v"

180,Sgt.DexSoll,155,390,763,2017-09-14,Recommended,84.1,"-creates a dwarf named Grumps the Headbasher. -Grumps wakes up from a torture room on a ship. -Grumps does not remember how he ended up there -Grumps meets a lady magister. -the Lady called grumps a dog. -Grumps was not impressed and showed her how he got the title Headbasher. -Grumps accidentally killed the lady magister. -everyone is mad at grumps. -Grumps kills everyone -Grumps walks in a room and finds a chunk of flesh -Grumps decided to eat it because he thought he would get healed by it. -instead Grumps killed himself because the flesh took his last point of HP. -this was the end of the chronicles of Grumps the Headbasher, who single handedly killed 4 guards but died of food poisoning.  EDIT  And now since people started saying this isn't a review. no it is not it is simply a joke when i first started the game without any clue as to what i might end up with. i was at a moment of weakness when i just got my salary and came home drunk. so the next morning i started playing the game. here's an actual review based on my 9 hours of playtime.  the pros: -you have total freedom on how you want to play the game  (could also be seen as a con at times)  -indepth turnbased combat  (height matters and you have to anticipate that sometimes out from the shadows people can turn up to kill you)  -the origin characters have rich personality's and you don't really have to play as them to influence their story since they can also be your companions.  -story length.  there are 3 story acts that have a suprisingly long playtime and each time you want to replay it it's almost always different since like i said you have total freedom over what you will do. ( i play multiple characters but right now i am about 6 hours in on my undead witch and i haven't even come close to finish act 1 and from what i've heard of others act 1 can easily become 15 hours of playtime)  -OPTIMIZATION! this game's beautifull combat effects can clutter your whole screen and your computer (or laptop) can still run it smoothly  Now some small cons:  -*total freedom on how you play. sure is nice to play it however you want but... you must also discover each mechanic yourself (this is also how Grumps started a fight because i accidentally stole a book infront of the magister and also may have hit her with a knife before) also you can miss allot of story contents if you randomly kill people.  -tutorial is a bit vague sometimes and forgettable when you get too much on your plate because at same time you are fighting and trying to predict what your enemy is going to do.  after this there aren't many cons about this game that i can mention until i have actually experienced the full game and not just act 1. call me biased but just of the sheer size of the game you should try it. i can already sense this has allot of replay value."

Baulders Gate, Diablo, D&D, etc.) then this will be your salvation from the lack of major titles in the genre. It stays true to its table top roots while also giving a stylish spin to everything we've had to use our imagination for over the years. The combat is fast paced and tactical. Everything is a weapon, including the environment. It really comes down to what you have available to you and what you can think up with each situation. The story is well written and engaging. It keeps you hooked to see how your particular play through pans out in the grand scheme of the world. Plus the mulitplayer support adds a lot of fun and interesting ideas to the mix. Such as your companions (either real people or a.i.) will each view the quests differently and have different motives and reasoning for every action. Sometimes things work out, other times you end in a bloody brawl after a quest choice turns sour. Each adventure breathes a wealth of choices and possibilities. Don't forget the game master mode either! Being able to create your own adventures for your friends, or anyone for that matter, to battle through is worth the price in itself. There will always be new content to play or create to keep this game going for ages. PVP is also included to add that pinch of competition outside of your main campaign that turns into a explosive game of wits before you know it. All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone seeking adventure or a little more ""choice"" out of their game. Have fun solo or with friends as you fight to replace the divine that the world has lost. May your blades and mind be sharp!"

You are offered many choices, though you have only one right answer.  Ordinary animals all have exotic and jarring magic powers that make no sense. Alligators, despite what you might expect, have the ability to teleport other and summon powerful meteors from the heavens. Probably other powers too, but I wasn't strong enough to fight them. Other creatures all seemingly have these exotic and nonsensical abilities, though I wasn't strong enough to fight them either.  The characters aren't really all that interseting or likeable. One of them attacks you, and you're given the option of being a total ?????, or fighting and killing her. I killed her. She dead, there goes one of the main characters. Oh, and you need her in order to progress, as the game expects you to have her, or you aren't strong enough to tackle encounters, so I guess that's game over.  I liked the first one, and I wanted to like this one. It too had the open world can go where you please, as you please, but you have to do fights in this specific order, and win through this specific strat. While not my favor, it wasn't a deal breaker.  What was a deal breaker was the animals having such insanely powerful magic. It just broke immersion completely. I don't understand how alligators can summon your party members to them and then drop meteors on them. These were not gator-men, ancient wizards from a lost age or anything. Just random lizards on the shore. Oher monsters were all the same. It completely ruined my suspension of disbelief."

Also, players are deliberately getting tricked investing into wits where it gives the char +1 initiate and +1% crit chance BUT the games initiative order is ????ed up due to design choices ( I guess) so your initiative stats designed to affect your own party's order. The game always makes sure AI enemy is getting a turn after you.  Another thing is really boring is the ????ing item progression. I changed 3 rare weapons for same char at the same level.

Between the campaign, multiplayer, custimization & workshop this game has ALOT to offer. There is one thing however that is quite severe in terms of playing with others that really gets me, and that is the drop-in & out multiplayer. Sure they made due on there promises allowing friends to come and go as they please, however for those that do decide to join in a friends group at a later date for the long haul are in for a treat. Not only do you get treated as a second rate ""dirty npc"" which has zero impact on the story along with few dialogue choices (even with characters you can pick up from the beginning. This also includes the important pvp arena fights which you get auto kicked out.) but in addition any character dialoges that DO come from your character you can't select, leaving it up to other players to pick what YOU say. This essentally gives a similar feeling to the 4 player mod found in div 1, as unless you love reading a novel or fighting a join in player has minimal impact on the game outside of killing everyone.   All & all they did have drop in & out support, I just wish it was more through and well structured then a mod from div 1."

73,jeep,161,48,0,2017-09-15,Recommended,75.4,"I am incredibly excited to say that this game is all that I could have asked of Larian Studios. As someone who loves Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, etc, Divinity: Original Sin 2 simply blows my mind. The dialogue can be witty, comedic, even tongue-in-cheek, but at times it is also grim, dark, and serious. Each character has their own way of coping with situations, and you as the player must work to keep the group together. You can choose the class of all of your adventurers, and tweak your main character at the start screen - in effect, you can multiclass from the get-go. Abilities synergize and can create opportunities that can be exploited by other party members - or, if you're not careful, by the enemy!   In terms of customization, the game is lovely. In summation, you can advance your character in a non-linear fashion if you so choose, but you might find it easier to create classes that are symbiotes (they benefit from each other's abilities).  In terms of audio, the game is FANTASTIC. The voice acting is wonderfully immersive, and the sound effects are well-timed and well-orchestrated. Speaking of orchestas, the soundtrack is incredible. If you don't believe me, give it a listen on YouTube. The ability to choose which instrument will play at turning points of the campaign really gives you that feeling of audio customization, and lets you feel like you are in control of every aspect of the game.  In short, I may sound like a ""yes-man"" when I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I may sound like there's nothing wrong with the game, but there are several bugs which are still unfixed and exploits that can be exposed to the savvy gamer. But, if you are like me, and you simply enjoy a game for what it has to offer (a complex storyline, diverse characters, entertaining combat, excellent audio, above-average graphics), then this game is for you!"

123,federated state of trollnesia,158,80,5,2017-09-15,Recommended,51.7,"Some pretty severe balancing problems really hurt this game on the harder difficulties at the moment I write this review. It definitely seems like melee-heavy parties are not very viable. I've restarted three times now and reduced my party's melee investment with each restart and I've been progressively enjoying the combat more as a result. Basically, melee at least so far in the first act, do not have mobility skills they need to do anything. Attacks of opportunity require a trait investment, which is kind of lame. It doesn't help armored enemies mitigate a lot of melee damage and that getting magic resistance as a fighter is difficult, resulting in a lot of annoying CC from numerous enemies.  I've had to cheese a lot of my fights to win them (abusing conversation mechanics mostly) and it feels kind of bad.  The game is still fun, but I would advise doing research about party composition before investing a lot of XP.  Also, this game commits a lot of ""cardinal sins"" for me: 1. Persuading people down from fights...results in a net XP loss and no notable change in the story's outcome (at least so far); as far as I can tell, being a murderous bastard is the best way to play this (by far, even). Aside from meager barter prices I don't see a point in making a charismatic character. 2. You're encouarged to fight and kill trash for XP; at multiple parts in the first act instead of advancing the story like I wanted to, I was compelled to scour the area for more things to kill. If you like this, then this is the game for you. Reminds me a lot of Baldur's Gate in that regard. 3. Some party members, if you don't keep them on a short leash, will break quests for you by doing naughty things to NPCs. 4. Quests break...and there's no notification about it. It's basically a missing thread. It's kind of interesting this way, leaving you to figure out how to resolve the quest, but if there's no way to resolve it, you'll never know for sure. So be careful when you go murdering people who might be connected with a quest. This is definitely preferable over Skyrim's ""everyone is invulnerable"" bullcrap, but I'd like to know when I've royally ruined everything and should reload. 5. A lot of game mechanics aren't forshadowed at all (one of the early fights has turtles which...explode for a ton of damage when you kill them, really great surprise when you have a lot of melee in your party) and you'll be reloading after you experience them. 6. Numerous boss weapon drops so far for me have been inferior to standard stuff I find in shops. It's funny (not in a way I like), this one notable enemy I killed dropped a dagger which had a ""10% bleed chance"" mod on it - and that was supposed to be the draw for me using it I guess? In a turn based strategy game, ""10% anything"" might as well as not be there. There are a lot of other lukewarm mods on gear that might as well not be there or do anything. I've been vendoring a lot of stuff. 7. Gold isn't super abundant, so you will be picking up pots, pans, and kitchen sinks to make by. I've never liked this as it's just absolutely silly and tedious.   Depsite my gripes, this is definitely a solid RPG and tactics game, at least the most of what we can expect from 2017."

447,spookwhisper,506,4,0,2017-09-15,Recommended,56.1,"This game is -inarguably- niche. It comes out like a classic CRPG right to the core, an extremely well made translation of pen and paper gaming to a cigital medium. If you like pen and paper games, both RPG and skirmish style games included, you'll love this game. If you like squad-based strategy like Xcom, you'll love this game.  Along with its very robust take on traditional RPGs the game offers quite a diverse list of skills and assets right off the bat before we even have been given access to its modding API.  That being said, the game's primary strength is its greatest weakness, at least in respect to the main campaign mode of the game. It's an RPG unfettered by the tropes and clear story path of modernity. Even frequent PnP gamers are going to be left scratching their head for a while out of the gates. You can and will fail quests inexplicably, get left behind by NPCs if you go to loot more when they are proceeding to something else, and the slightest mis-step can irreversably change your playthrough. For example in one of the earliest dungeons, you can step through an unlabelled door hoping its an exit or a way to proceed only to find out it leads right into the courtyard of the fort you were infiltrating. A moment later you realize this turns many NPCs hostile, some of which are very powerful at that level and patrol the starting town.  If the game is such a throwback to classic RPGs, why isn't there some kind of dungeon master feedback to when you're about to accidentally do something very dumb?  -----  Act 1 Update:  Now on the final fight of Act 1, I'm still not thrilled with game's main campaign. Its main problems are the pacing, lack of dungeon master feedback, and chaotic difficulty curve. It's very stop and start with the pacing, letting you calmly explore at leisure before randomly throwing in URGENCY with no prior DM feedback. You cross a line and scripts trigger with very little nuance. There is little to guide you through the zone to meet each encounter at an appropriate level on top of that, so expect to spend your first few hours save scumming around to find just the right order in which to defeat every encounter to come out powerful enough to defeat the act boss.  -----  Acts 2-4 Update:  Once you've finally managed to use a cheesy enough set of tactics to get through the final 2 fights of Act 1 it's all smooth sailing from there. HAHA. Nah that's a lie. You can still accidentally skip crucial plot points, fail to recieve plot crucial powers, and have literally nothing to guide you accept the need for more EXP. Unless you by chance end up on the developers' intended story path you not only can become completely lost and unable to progress... You can completely break the progression! You can end up in Act 4 without powers you were supposed to obtain in Act 2 that are critical to gameplay and progression. You can end up doing everything needed for the story along one path, but the game won't recognize it because you didn't do things in the exact order the game wanted.  The main campaign of this game is a flowchart of chaos and bad scripting. It's got Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" levels of WHAT IS EVEN GOING ON without the unearthly charisma of Tommy's complete mania.  Do not buy this game for its main story alone. It's 30+ hours of potentially wasted time. If your game offers that many hours of content, there shouldn't be conditions in which you have to completely restart it because you missed something at hour 4 you need for hour 26.  ----  Game Master Module  Always save the best for last. That is something that I should not have done with this game. I almost would not reccomend this game if not for the raw potential it had with the Game Master module. Not only does it allow you to make your own custom campaigns to upload for everybody, you are able to play as the invisible hand of god with your friends and build a campaign as you go. It's a PnP gamer's dream game.  It does have its flaws though. The GM mode's sucess is going to hinge very heavily on support from a modding community to add more assets and maps to the system and potential future updates from Larian. It is almost barebones right now, and you sadly cannot build dungeons tile-by-tile. If you want completely custom maps you will need to learn how to make them with the modding API itself."

In the Beta alone I have over 30 hours of play time, and we barely got out of the first area. That isn't a bad thing at all! That is a testament to the variety of ways that you can do things. We wanted to try all the different classes, the different racial traits, the different talents. The addition of a single talent can entirely change how the story plays out, which dramatically increases replayability. You're presented with multiple ways to resolve your quests, and each are different and can have influence on multiple aspects of your character. Despite the 30+ hours in beta I still found entirely new things in release.  The story is rich and deep because of how so much of your character influences different interactions and what you find along the way. The combat being turn based is a lot more thoughtful than just running up and bashing your strongest skill, you can truly use the environment to your advantage, or accidentally screw yourself over with it if you aren't careful.  It really harkens back to the classic rpgs of the past in such a great way.  My only real critique is that the learning curve is sort of steep to start, camera movement isn't the most intuitive and takes a bit to figure out the finessing of it, as the tutorial is minimal.

In the Beta alone I have over 30 hours of play time, and we barely got out of the first area. That isn't a bad thing at all! That is a testament to the variety of ways that you can do things. We wanted to try all the different classes, the different racial traits, the different talents. The addition of a single talent can entirely change how the story plays out, which dramatically increases replayability. You're presented with multiple ways to resolve your quests, and each are different and can have influence on multiple aspects of your character.

1458,Hitch,25,2,0,2017-09-15,Recommended,102.8,"I purchased, but didn't log a ton of hours in the remastered first iteration of this game (36 hrs), but this 2nd one just feels right, and it's a homerun for Larian. I will start by saying I have only experienced the co-op of this game, which so far has been a load of fun to play with a good friend:   Areas to highlight:  The story telling is vastly improved, with exceptional voice dialogue (gaming industry wise). There are a ridiuclous amount of options for dialogue depending on your characters skills and tags. Rich orchestra sounds bring you back to some of your favorite RPGs of old. The game is gorgeous too, graphics are superb. Scenes are incredibly detailed, from brightly lit beach environments to dark, dreary dungeons. The mood is dark and sombre overall but clever writing adds in humor all along the way. HUD is intuitive and nothing new, co-op shared backpack screen is something to behold; very convenient. The combat is intuitive but high on difficulty, Larian does not hold your hand in this one. There are major things in the game that are not obvious which I won't spoil, and without the internet you'd miss a lot. Highly recommend playing without reading up on the game, it makes for a much better/realer experience. Those new to this type of game will repeat battles many times over on the harder difficulties. This is Turn-Based though, at it's best. Re-trying is half the fun, learning from your previous mistakes becomes essential. Winning a battle on the first go after using perfect tactics really feels satisfying.  Areas for Improvement:  We encountered minor bugs, a learned spell that wouldn't show up in the mage book, finishing a successful dialogue with a creature then clicking them again by accident only to have new dialogue that leads to a fight. Stuff that requires a reload but isn't game breaking, and occurs infrequently. The environment manipulation is incredible, and no other game has allowed players to control fights so well using it, however it becomes a bit too much at times with the blood, water and other puddles--often making magic-type characters useless since every attack hurts your friends and foes alike. Source spells are a great idea but would be nice to be able to use once per battle or game day. Current game makes it hard to accumulate source points for skills that truthfully really arent as impressively OP as they should be at that rarity. Lastly, the gold/bartering system needs a hotfix bad. You need to move a slider to hit exact gold value on both sides, without an option to go up by 1 or type in a value. This is a basic that has been overlooked.   Summary:  I look forward to logging many more hours before updating this review (so far at around 30 hrs). Recommended for anyone who loves old-school (or new) cRPGs or any 1-4 group of friends looking for a great game to co-op, just note it requires much focus, dialogue/reading and chatting, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a stranger. Also be prepared for 4 hr+ play times. It is almost impossible to make any progress in 1-2 hr playings. Congrats to Larian on a job well done, it's been one of the better RPG games I have played in years.  I would score D:OS2 9/10."

To my surprise, every time I took a peak the world, characters, game mechanics, and story were all better than the last time I played.   Now that we are at release, I can say with the utmost certainty that Larian Studios has done a masterful job. Though I am only in Fort Joy, the level of polish and player choice is unlike anything I have played in recent memory. This is a studio that deserves recognition as not only did they keep all of the promises they made during their kickstarter campaign, but they also added so much more (Voice Acting, All Undead Races, Controller Support).  Congratulations, Larian Studios. You were amongst my top developers before this, and based on what I have played, you may have caught up to CD Projekt Red. Well done!"

398,wm.j.olson,138,33,5,2017-09-15,Not Recommended,26.3,"This issue of the game has serious balance problems. Virtually every fight early on you face opponents who individually or in the 'army' they can summon immediately overwhelm. There is basically no way to win confrontations with over-powered enemies. Enemies you stumble into are always levels above you or your team, armed with better weapons, have more skills, and better protection.  The learning curve depends on saving every turn and reloading when you lose, only to stumble into anothr no-win situation.   In the meantime, because everything you can buy is overpriced and what you sell mostly sells for peanuts, you can't earn money to buy better stuff.  Nor is it possible to complete missions and engage in combat to improve skills. So constant save and reload to dodge encounters, which of course means you can't earn experience just rinse and repeat hoping for the best the next time.  You can create your own character but you can't save it.  So, if you want to start again, you can't load the character you created.  There's basically no in-game tutorial that helps or explains what's going on or what to look for.  The few things covered have descriptions that are next to useless.  You can choose various skills with weapons that require certain attibutes, like finesse.  Fine.  What weapons does that support and where do you find the answer?  Someplace like YouTube or discussions elsewhere other than the game.  Compared to the other Divinity games, this one comes up short.  There's a system to identify collectable objects, since the game world is full of things, but the system doesn't cover much of what is there, so it's trial and error, hit and miss.  The game is now out of early access but it feels and plays like much remains to be done and it is not clear if the developers will respond to the need."
429,CoolestCat,144,26,2,2017-09-15,Not Recommended,36.2,"Great game, awesome voiceovers and story potential for party play. However two major issues that don't cut it for me:  Backtracking The level and gear progression seems off with the amount of content there is per area. You need to be EXTREMELY careful not to miss ANYTHING or else in the next area you'll get the message the mobs are too strong and get completely overwhelmed in sheer numbers and power.   For people that like to explore and check every nook and cranny this is not a problem. For people that would like to just get on with the story it's bloody annoying going back to old areas to kill mobs that have been skipped to catch up levels and farm gold to upgrade gear. The progression in this game does NOT feel natural at all.  Oversimplified combat The combat feels nice and original at first. But sooner or later it became clear that a few tactics that worked at the start can be readily applied to 90% of the encounters. I was expecting combat where planning and strategy were key to victory.  It lacks diversity and variety that could have been done much better.   It is cool that elements can be used as a combo e.g. oil + fire. The cooldown of skills need to be looked at though, because often I cast my spells and use my abilities, and then it's back to normal attacks for a few turns (not for all classes) which is boring and limits strategy if my only option is to autoattack when all skills have been used and are on cooldown for all partymembers. This is especially true early game, less late game when you get more skills.   If these points don't concern you then it's a great game, otherwise it feels unpolished and lacking."
514,FUNKY FRESH BEATS,115,36,9,2017-09-15,Not Recommended,78.4,"Game has tons of issues. To start, combat. It makes me want to strangle the early access players for not bringing up such blatant problems. Almost all enemies in the game have nearly twice as much movement as you do, forcing you to constantly scramble around in fights, and never having the upper hand. Because of this, positioning becomes worthless. Trying to bottleneck or choke off enemies doesn't work either, because they'll walk straight through a blazing fire up to your backline and annihilate them. Then you can only run back 10ft, while they can run 20ft, and still attack twice. Enemy missiles tend to ignore solid objects completely, screwing your position. They also have twice as much range as your characters do, giving them multiple rounds of free hits off. Sometimes you'll both be on even ground, staring right at each other, with the same weapon, but the enemy can fire over objects while you can't because 'line of sight obscured.' Enemies also tend to hit much higher, despite being the same level as you, with only minor equipment differences.  Abilities are too weak to even merit use. You can hold two wands with poison/fire, and spam the auto attack, which will poison then explode the area around the enemy, as opposed to spending twice as many skillpoints throwing oil on them then fire. The only good skills are ones that involve movement, like teleportation, because as previously stated the positioning in this game is god awful, and having a spell that lets you immediately reposition is broken.  On top of that, the armor system is atrocious. The devs claimed that diversity is key, but what they really meant is that everyone in your party has to be hybrid otherwise you're ????ed. And it only gets worse and worse, until basic enemies are just bloated sponges with upwards of 2-3 THOUSAND armor. And this time around, armor denies everything but flat damage and blinds, so basically your CC is worthless until you spend 3 rounds busting their armor. 99% of situations are better off being handled just by dogpiling and blowing all your damage abilities at once, hoping to burst the enemy down.   Drop system is bad too. You could spend 15 minutes fighting higher leveled enemies, carefully planning and strategizing, only to be rewarded with scraps of wood. Despite the fact that they are wearing nice looking plate armor and carried shiny, big weapons. Avoiding conflict is a better choice almost always, because rewards from actually killing enemies are non existent.    And finally, the RPG system, the biggest draw of the game, is horrendous. You have two options. Play like a nice guy ?????, or fight 10 people at once. Standing up for yourself or trying to be heroic is always met with getting gang banged. 90% of the time, dialogue will always lead to the exact same ending, no matter which choices you make. It might come to that ending through different means, but it never feels like you actually influenced anything.   tl;dr, the game fails in both aspects of what it was meant to be. DO NOT BUY until it has been patched, re patched, and then sewn back together. I foresee many refunds in the near future."

Anyway, putting together a party from the available classes feels awkward, clunky, unpleasant, and unable to fill out the party in a manner I'd like with less than 5 (or two built from scratch, as with the first game).  Wasn't a cheap game, so I suppose I'll keep playing and trying to make it work, after starting over from scratch to try to compensate for the party with the one character I can fully design. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bought the game, it's a waste of my gaming budget. Thus far, it's nowhere near as fantastic as the first game was, and I'm completely disappointed. Hopefully it'll get better later, but it's off to a rough start and I'm not optimistic.  First game was incredible. This one has yet to impress me in any way.  Edit: Gave it another hour. Still bad. Had I not been stuck with that crash bug, and the solo mission (in other words, the waste of time stuff before being able to start assembling a group and experiencing how bad this game is) I would have refunded this game.  0/10. That's as a long time lover of RPGs. This is garbage. I wouldn't, knowing what I know now, buy it on sale for even one dollar. Incidentally, I have 82 hours played with the first game."

I'm playing on the Classic difficulty, and there are two difficulties higher than this one.  My characters are now level 7, but this is still an early review, as I have yet to complete act 1.  Pros: 1.) Combat is incredibly tactical. There have been a couple of fights where I got my butt handed to me because I didn't think to exploit the terrain or the destructibles placed in the battlefield.  Height matters a lot more in this game, especially if you have a huntsman. 2.) Oddly, the soundscape is amazing.  Walking through town you can hear the bustling of people walking around. It sounds great when you're in a dungeon, along the beach, and everywhere.   3.) Voiceovers, world building, and characters has been spot on so far.  I have found some characters to be really funny, and others to be incredibly intriguing, such as Losche. 4.) The game doesn't prevent you from doing things out of order.  Once you escape from Fort Joy, it really opens up and allows you to wander around the map in any direction.   Cons: 1.) Don't get me wrong, the UI is pretty well done in this game.  However, there are some UI'isms that I would like improved.  Such as being able to send all of my ""wares"" to one character (who has the highest bartering skill).   2.) Saved game bloat bug.  Right now there is an issue with saved games getting extremely bloated to the point where it can take a long time for my computer to upload the saved games to the cloud.    Closing Thoughts: This is definitely a CRPG that has had a lot of love and time put into it.  It will ask a lot of you (time wise) to get going, but so far, it has been a really enjoyable ride!  I definitely recommend it so far, and I will update as I get further into the game.  EDIT: Updated with some more pros and cons.  (If this review isn't helpful for you, please leave a comment so that I can address them!)"
151,Saguthegreat,163,45,1,2017-09-16,Recommended,135.5,Pros:- Great combat mechanics and a very rich story and lore. What blows me away is that it seems like each and every dialogue in this game which has more than 1000 NPCs is completly very well voice acted. kudos to the devs!   Cons:- The game has a lot (and i mean a LOT) of sidequests/party quests and the game's quest tracker becomes too cluttered. I hope the devs include a quest marker for individual quests rather than marking all the quest waypoints on the map together.

812,Awkward,522,3,1,2017-09-16,Recommended,342,"I've got to do a full review here, because this is probably one of the best games ive ever played. The only other RPG I've been this engrossed in since childhood is probably Witcher 3. I legitimately am just looking forward to the end of my shifts at work because I want to just go back to playing D:OS2.  First, the side quests are super fleshed out and frankly revolutionary in a way that I hope sets precedents for future RPGs. Remember how we all praised witcher 3 for having a lot of side quests but none of them being simple mindless fetch-quests like in Bethseda RPGs? This game has one-upped that: the game is jampacked with side quests, none of them are fetch quests, and you have a variety of ways of completing them that can change how the quest develops and rewards you without the options being inherently wrong.   There are ways to fail the sidequests, sure, but there's also fleshed out ways of completing quests (read: It's not '""You get Dialogue B instead of Dialogue A because you clicked text Option B instead of Option A). You have unique ways that make the story of the side quest finish in unique ways which end in unique rewards. In fact, the way you complete one side quest can have a domino effect that can change other things in the game including the options you have to complete other quests. It makes the world feel alive and dynamic and I hope this becomes a RPG staple.  Second, the combat is exquisite. It's everything great about the tactical and in-depth customization Original Sin 1 had but better. New classes, a more balanced AP system, etc. Basically, you get four action points per turn that can be used to attack, to move, cast spells, etc. Typical S-RPG stuff. However, the depth of the tactics you can pull off is pretty much the best there is gaming. Just to give you an idea of how the combo system works: If you use a fire spell, the spot you hit will now be 'burning'. Walking over it will cause fire damage and set a burning DOT condition. Use a water spell? Well now it's extinguished! But there will be a steam cloud, and if you use lightning on it you can stun everyone inside that cloud. That's a small sample of what you can do: You can fly, teleport, ram, sneak, whatever you want through combat and the amount of combos and unique interactions you can find are limitless. It feels like every single 'quintessential' fantasy rpg archetype was lovingly crafted into the combat.   The game came out like a week ago and I already have 60 hours in it. All I think about when I'm at work is how much longer until I can play Divinity again. I haven't felt this way about a video game since I was a little kid. My main save has about 30 hours in it and I'm probably like 1/4 through the game (also got a 2nd save for the co-op). I haven't even touched Game Master mode (which is basically Dungeons and Dragons with full control of basically every asset in the game) and Arena (PVP) yet. I could see myself easily logging hundreds of hours on this game.  This is hands down game of the year and hands down one of the best games I've ever played. I had huge hopes for this game and was really worried it wouldn't live up to the hype. But this is hands down everything I could have wanted from a sequel to D:OS1. You're missing out if you don't get it."

Turns out drinking tea and spend half the match eating random items is a very good strategy.   My co-op partner in crime is not a looter, but actually reads the dialogue. Working together is thus a very good way of playing. He gets all the story + depth of the game while I get to spend more time around looting.   A tip tho: Distribute the loot, quite impractical when the team member with all the healing + scrolls manages to set herself on fire and die... 3 attempts in a row.

41,Amorous Bicurious Pholidota,202,48,2,2017-09-16,Not Recommended,47.2,"1. UI   Menus for crafting, character sheets and so on are obstructive. Terrain such as bridges, overhanging cliffs etc block nearly all vision of your party which makes it difficult to navigate through streets and valleys. Sometimes you can end up walking all the way up a hill and through a an environment hazard because you clicked on a random cliff edge above wherever your characters were.  2. Combat and quests  Unless you thoroughly go through each area and soak up as many quests as possible you will be underleveled and undergeared. This, in combination with the ruthless AI, makes combat an absolute chore that requires savescumming.   Element interactions and environmental hazards are poorly explained and require experimentation to fully understand. So much can be going on during a fight that it is difficult to gauge what is happening at any given time. Aiming up and down cliffs also seems to have random restrictions placed on what you can and cannot hit (spells can't go over banisters, but arrows act like ICBM's when shot up from the first floor).   3. Camera  The camera is at the perfect level of awkwardness where it requires you to zoom allll the way out to see where you're going but demands you zoom back in to pixel hunt for objects. It's easy to lose track of dead bodies in tall grass or behind bushes unless you outline them with fire spells first. Sometimes a combination of bad geometry and camera angles will make it impossible for you to see enemy NPC's at all. It is very frustrating to walk into a random ambush after failing to manually save the game.  4. Map design  Maps act like extended corridors for the sake of staging ambushes. Walk into an area -> autosave function triggers -> hostile NPC gives you 1-3 responses which almost always end up in a fight.  5. Skills, attributes  The effectiveness of any given build during a blind run comes down to dumb luck.   Example: I ran into some lava slugs in a cavern. Unless I had taken the trait that allowed me to diplomatically talk to slugs/dogs/cats I would have had to fight them with a butter knife and wool clothes. I had literally no idea that would be useful prior to that situation.   There are a bunch of other, smaller issues I could also talk about but these are the core problems I have had with the game over six hours.  Edit  Whoever designed the second act boat fight is a goddamned sadist. Enemies moving before their turn, necro fire spam, inability to place my healers next to the NPC... what the ????. It's like I'm playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance for ???????s."
224,Jynx,122,17,1,2017-09-16,Not Recommended,93.4,"This game is not just not that fun to play. Everytrhing feels needlessly complex without a real payoff. The menus are a pain to slog through. I constantly struggled to get the camera in the right spot to see anything. And good luck findning anything. You have to press a key to see items and that doesn't show half the stuff you actually want to pick up. For such a complex game, you really need extensive intro to game mechanics to have the faintest clue what is going on and that is not present.  Just as an example, lets say you want to sell items. Great, so almost every NPC you meet is a vendor with some gold and items to sell. So that means you have to click on every NPC to see what theyre selling. And when you want to sell you have to move all the gear to the character with the bartering skill so you can sell it at max price. Theres a good chance that all your gear is actually on the character with thievery (because he steals stuff and opens chests) or the one with high wits that you use to spot hidden treause and traps. So have fun moving all your gear between characters that all have individual carrying capacity and inventories full of potions and scrolls.  This game seems to be meant for a small subset of gamers that like a really heavy story-driven rpg with super complex mechanics and don't mind all the difficulties that come with no limits on what you can do. There's a reason conventions like group inventory or merchant NPC's or skill trees exist - they save the gamer time so they can go do the fun stuff like exploring the world and story. Suffice it to say, I see the promise in this game and if some of its underlying gameplay was changed to be more user friendly I would gladly enjoy the story. Instead I feel set adrift among a host of unexplained, needlessly comlex game mechanics without direction as to where to go or if I'm doing something wrong."

Where it falls short are the many design issues that I genuinely can't distinguish from being bugs half the time, namely;  A quest log that doesn't record if a quest is finished half the time, making it impossible to tell if a questline is  finished or not.  Enemies that are ridiculously strong even on normal. Being forced to go down to the easiest difficulty due to  running out of ways to resurrect your party members is not a fun game mechanic.  A UI and map that are utterly useless, quests aren't marked on the map at all. I can understand that in a game where you are encouraged to figure things out for yourself, but you simply can't when the quest logs are bugged themselves. There's also no way to seperate 'junk' items automatically, having to manually click dozens of items to sell them isn't fun.   I really want to enjoy this game but I can't with these issues (the broken quests are by far the most annoying, one example being me being forced into a loop where I had to return to a character who had died, making the quest impossible to complete).

A big pull was tactician mode from divinity os 1, the only difference it adds into this game, is turtles that blow up when killed (killing any melee unless you know wtf your doing) and +50% stat bloat. The mode literally removes any point placing attributes outside your main stat. This on top of a turn based system that enforces alternating moves between the player and then enemy. Wit (initiative) is useless.  Story is ok for an rpg, pacing is abit slow but thats more down to movement.

I am running an R9 390/i5 6500 combo, and while acheiving great performance FPS wise, the visual stuttering rendered this game unplayable in MULTIPLAYER.  Single player worked ok, but I wasn't interested in single player at this time. However, if you plan on playing this game alone, I would absolutely recommend it.  Once this bug is fixed I will revise my review but of the little gameplay I did see and play - the game is a wonderful successor to a wonderful CRPG that will have fans of the first and newcomers alike very, very pleased."

I've no idea why this game has positive reviews - other than it's pretty - very boring and too many glitches for my liking. Also the combat is completely unbalanced, die every time.  Given the reviews this game has, and that I like the genre I really wanted to like this game (hence putting some hours into it to ""get it"") .... but dying in every fight, every time, is a waste of time."

891,Iosevus Cross,216,7,8,2017-09-16,Not Recommended,37.8,"Absolutely overrated. The saves don't work half the time. Combat is painfully slow. Every fight you get in will go like this: You take 1 turn on a char, the enemy all take 2, you take another turn on a different party member, the enemy all take 2. AOE everywhere, everything casts decay, you hover over an enemy, confirm that tooltip is an enemy, cast spell and it hits your ally. The difficulty changes make little sense, even the difference between the lowest and next highest for settings has issues from being far too easy to being 2 shotted. Line of Sight doesn't always apply to the AI, even for direct attacks. The game is more about wasting your time than gameplay.  This game is majorly flawed in it's actual design.  To put it in a better perspective, since steam has the dumbest version of ""yes or no"" reccomendations I would say 6.5/10."

Played with 3 friends and it took 2 hours of game time to even get out of the intro and get to the first city so there goes my chance for a refund before the game even starts.  Combat is painfully slow playing with 4 people and the story was excruciatingly boring.  Sometimes combat was 3 or more hours between and I was struggling to stay awake, the only reason i continued to play was because it was coop and I could play with some friends.  One of my friends increased the difficulty from normal to hard and the rest of the time playing after that was spent strategically avoiding combat because it was too difficult for our team or we were severely outnumbered and would be wiped out in a single round.  We attempted to change it back to a more suitable difficulty so we could participate in combat more often, but apparently we could only change the difficulty once and now we are stuck in a role-playing game too afraid to get in to combat or be faced with instant death.  The graphics were nice, the spell effects were decent and I even liked the landscape - unfortunately it takes much more than that to make the game enjoyable and my experience with divinity was so unbearable I spent most of my time in the game watching movies while my team scolded me in discord for getting lost, falling behind and dying to traps.  A majority of the time playing was spent mindlessly following my team until we eventually got to a boss fight (which were so far and few inbetween it wasn't worth the wait). It wouldn't have been so bad if the follow feature wasn't disabled in coop so I could have just auto-followed them until combat started.  The jokes were lame and there was nothing comedic or funny about anything they said.   As far as I'm concerned this is a solo game that you should really play alone and should be played like a book. Expect minimum gameplay unless you enjoy looting worthless items, speaking to boring npcs or just clicking around the map mindlessly navigating areas."

I was told by friends that this one resolved all the issues of the first, it did not. If anything this one is 5X worse, at minimum.  They say the game has ""tactics"", but the only tactic that works is bugging out the AI so you can isolate enemies and use all 4 of your team vs 1.  Im about 5-7 fights in, and I am completely stuck, i have 3 different fights I can do, but they all result in the same outcome unless i resort to cheese to try and win.  At least the fights in the 1st weren't so 1 sided, and you could have a tactical fight. Even with the other fights I won without being cheezy, i still did not win any humanoid fights without having to reload my game 2 - 3 times, sneak in chars and unchain them into positions. If i wanted to play memory games I would go buy a ????ing deck of cards.   Wanna kick myself for even trying this at full price.  On the other side a few other cons, the armor looks odd on almost all char models. The char models / portraits look like they were rushed, more like clay statues with no life.  The voice acting is very good, but that so far is the one saving grace, this game needs patches, and the combat needs serious work.  For shame, for shame.   *Edit - I would petition for a refund if i weren't already 4 hours over the steam time frame."

1095,< blank >,52,No,0,2017-09-16,Not Recommended,126.7,"TLDR: good start, bugs in story, general bugs, boring puzzles, bad combat system, disbalanced tactician.  I loved, loved, loved DOS:EE.  Bought this on EA, played through EA, was very excited.  Overall, the start of the game is fantastic. But a few chapters into the game things just turn for the worse more and more.  I have now played 104 hours, reached Arx and I'm done.  Complete disbalance at Tactician. Ridiculous damage output, unreasonable values of armor and magic armor for enemies force you to abuse glitches, savescumming and other questionable tactics. (It turned though in the end - by utilizing clearly disbalanced lone wolf 2h 90% critrate ~300% multiplier build, combat is now too easy [although if for some reason I can't kill half of the enemies in the first turn, I probably die]). All that means combat was for me pretty much??????in tactician.  Completely ????ed up initiative system. Initiative values don't mean anything, the order in combat is often arbitrary.   Bugs with you character not having a turn in battle. 50 Initiative? Check. Skipping first turn of combat completely? Check. Happens like every other major bossfight.  Story bugs. My Fane has been on multiple occasions refered to as Lohse in dialogues. Repeating dialogues that you already had. Having dialogue later in the game that completely contradicts one you had earlier, etc.  And the biggest turnoff - puzzles (actually not puzzles, but bad puzzles and poorely designed quests. Arx is a complete disaster in this regard.). I now ????ed around for 2 hours stuck. Googled the solution - it's finding a painting in some other dungeon and bringing it to a particular spot between two other paintings. Doesn't have anything to do with the story. What the ????ing ????. The whole arx journey consists of such quests. Just go around, click on things, hope you progress.  Shrines in the nameless isle were also boring as ????.  Disappointed, uninstalling the game and forgetting about it for while. Hope larian fix some of the stuff eventually."

For example my experience so far has been..  I chose tactician difficulty as it said enemies will use tricks that they wont otherwise. i played few hours and was about to lower my difficulty from tactician and now i'm glad that i did not. It really makes you save scumming A LOT, but other hand it forces you to learn some dirty tricks to defeat enemies as they really do some dirty hoccus poccus to you. The difficulty lives by it name 100% in this game imo  It forces you kind a explore world more to find out ways to beat something that serves your royal head in a plate.. And when you do that you find some many interesting stuff from the game world that you would probably just missed. Mostly in other games exploring just feels kind a work but not in this one, it's rewarding  There has been many fights that i had to delay due lvl difference and bad gear, Fights that i need to find an alternative way to approach. Some situations feels so unfair until you really think it through. For me it is just pure joy, wanted so long something that is not just blatant rush in and slice everything or that stupid RNG kills your smart moves, it's you and your stupid moves and strategies what gets you killed.. and ofc i can blame a bit other games that has made your brain so dry for new ideas ;)  Same style goes with conversations. Listen what they have to say, it might help you later.. No it will help you later. Books, notes etc is rewarding to read as they can have life saving info or ways to unlock some puzzles later on. Sometimes even info about NPCs in game world wich you can use to get their favor in conversation. No, the game does not unlock conversation choises when you find info about people. For long time i haven't read so many diaries in game that i have in this game so far! Voice acting is not annoying to listen. DOS1 gave me that feel i was listening shakespeare but in this on they nailed it.  What i can say...  The victory is like drug now,  every nook and corner is my friend,  every item that is not nailed down is my salary or key to success,  every book or note makes me a bit more aware of the world in game. every stronger enemies that slain my team is like tasty revange when you come to beat them later on!  10/10 in my book  PS. if you are new to Divinity Orginal Sin, Tactician difficulty can be a bit harsh first ;)"

1653,Marirow,457,2,0,2017-09-17,Recommended,44.6," I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of tactical games like XCOM or Fire Emblem, or if you like story-heavy games.  The combat is the strongest part of the game, but it's also the hardest to get into; I had to restart the game multiple times to get the right party structure to tackle the game's challenges.  Adaptability and crowd control are key in this combat system. If you don't have the right party makeup, skills, and items, then it's going to feel like the game is cheating you. Enemies will constantly be inflicting status conditions (usually turn-skipping ones) if your armor isn't up to snuff. A lack of skills means that enemies will be able to out-maneuver and out-damage you. And, of course, having a party of all mages isn't a good idea when archers can just sit and take potshots at you three times a turn. If you're not sure what you're doing, there's no shame in playing on the lower difficulty setting. Trust me.  The other two major selling points of this game are the story and the exploration, both of which are a bit weaker in terms of originality but are just as great as the combat system. The dialogue is your standard Neverwinter Nights affair, made a bit spicier by the Tags system. Simply put, each character has Tags (related to aspects of their personality, history, or appearance) that give unique dialogue options. You can even acquire new tags as you play, making the system versatile as well. The dialogue itself is well-written and hilarious at times, giving the game a comedic twist and elevating it from a drab, boring fantasy adventure. I won't spoil the story, but I'll say that after 30 hours I've only brushed up against what the story has to offer. The thousands upon thousands of dialogue trees are backed up by some impressive voice acting, which makes reading through the game's story (which might as well be novel length, if not longer) actually fun and engaging instead of a slog.  The exploration, then. This is probably the weakest part of the game-- not  bad,  just  weaker.  The world is enormous and full of sidequests, characters, and miniature adventures to go on, which really scratched my explorative itch. However, I often felt that the game wasn't using its exploration elements as well as it could. Quests can only really reward you with money and gear; money always gets hoovered by buying new, better gear from shopkeepers, and gear almost always becomes obsolete as soon as your characters level up. I found myself picking up really cool, unique gear, only for it to be  immediately  replaced by something slightly better. This is on top of a loot system that leaves your inventory constantly cluttered with random garbage, and forces you to check every single empty crate just in case there's a scroll of resurrection inside. I swear, Rivellon has an epidemic of empty crates.  In short, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a  very good game.  My biggest complaints are with the little things. The combat is just a little to obtuse, the exploration is just a little too unimportant, etc. The good things far, far outweigh the bad. If you're a fan of CRPGs, like games that focus on the story, or enjoy tactical combat, this game is an excellent buy."

1759,Morr-gan,334,2,0,2017-09-17,Recommended,116.6,"The game's start is an extremely, extreeeemely steep learning curve.  you essentially start off with no armour, and ?????? weapons, and will be placed against enemies that could 1v1 you and win without breaking a sweat.   Even Dark Souls gives you an easier time starting off than this, trust me.  I recommend playing an Origin character before playing as custom, to get your first experience with a unique character, as the different characters have their own personal questlines and dialogue, which is interesting.  Combat is amazing as ever, however the initiative system has changed from the first one, instead whoever simply has the highest will start (or if it's a scripted boss/enemy to go first), then it will alternate between friend/foe/friend/foe.  Magic Armour and Physical Armour are interesting and basically grants you guranteed immuntie to certain status effects, like Stunned, Knocked down and bleeding unless said armour is reduced to 0. has it's drawback as it means if you dont have the perserverence attribute levelled some you'll get stunlocked in unfortunate positions by mages.  Lots of gametime for the story, with even double if you don't skip all the dialogue and pay attention to side quests (which I didn't).  overall 9/10 some bugs, but overall game is fantastic with a great story."
1774,Agfct,404,2,0,2017-09-17,Recommended,117.5,"The Divinity Original Sin games are some of those hidden gems of gaming that you may have never heard of, but they just amaze you ones you start to play them.   Divinity Original sin 2 is like its predecessor focused on strategic gameplay, turn-based combat, and clever conversations. If you loved Divinity Original Sin 1 (or EE) you will love this one, and if you love old school strategic turn-based gameplay with focus on conversations (E.g. actually reading the quest description) then this game is for you.  In addition to being a completely new game, Divinity Original Sin 2 introduces new races like undead, new spells, magic armor (absorbs CC effects) and more.  Pros: -	Deep questlines with choices. -	Lots of different spells, talents, and abilities, that you choose almost freely. -	Turn based tactical combat that forces you to think. -	Voice acting on all conversations.  Cons: -	Can be brutally hard if you make the wrong choices (E.g. wrong set of spells, companions, or kills the wrong person).  Would rate it 9/10. The game has everything, but can be quite a challenge if you make a lot of wrong choices.   My Experience: Personally i have restarted my journey one time, as the first time i played i had to figure out what spells, companions and combinations of melee, ranged, magic i wanted. This game is not plug and play, and i would say it is more difficult in classic mode (normal) from the beginning then Divinity Orginal Sin EE Classic mode. You are very early on forced to look for scraps, craft gear and prepare yourself as mutch as possible in order to progress through combat. Combat is even more brutal this time around as the new magic and physical armor will prevent you from CC your enemies until it is destroyed.   The game rewards you for hard work, but you will have to work hard from very early on. Good Luck!  "

Controls are really bad in combat, you can barely zoom, clicking your characters to do something is tricky and Ive had 3 times Ive lost an extremely long and hard fight because the game didnt register that I clicked a character with a skill and instead just walked like an idiot. 2.	Skill/attack look is boring/bad It looks/feels exactly like the style of game before 2000, there have been done nothing to make it feel like an actual battle, so combat looks incredibly dull and boring. 3.	Balance is utterly crap, like every DnD based game you either build exploitive and become OP as hell, or build as you like rp wise and suck hard at the game (stats means so much bc dnd system). 4.	It is both exceptional linear and at the same time there is no redline to follow. So you need to progress and the game is all about getting from story point A to B and there is little to do in between, but the guidance of the story, motivation and making you feel there is a story at all just isnt there. So I must admit after 5-6 hours in the game (19hours played) I had +- given up on the story, not because it would be to hard to follow but because it was pointless as nothing I did had any effect (killing all guards, prisoners still just stand stupid. Winning arena, npc only remove neck from your main ignore the rest of the team. Interactions are very limited and there is no feeling of atmosphere or reason to do anything or not do something.

I did my research and thought this game sounded nice. I started on medium, and I realized two things. One: the battles are stupidly hard, you barely stand a chance against things your own level, Two: the complete lack of ways to gain XP or make money make progressing a slow druge through terrible battles that I just have no time for. Sucks they decided gateing the story behind tedium was the way they wanted to go.  I understand a lot of people enjoy this type of thing, but for my taste this is FAR too slow. The witcher 3 I think is an example of a game that does this right, it feels difficult but it also feels like you can do things to curb the difficulty when you need to, grinding or going on side quests. This game does nothing to point you toward any side quests or even give you options to grind for gold / xp so you can progress. Sad but to each their own. Enjoy guys, even if I can't!"

The combat system is  one of the worst I've ever seen. Extremely hard even on easiest difficulty and totally overloaded with unfair spells like Shackles of Pain which will make you scream in frustration.

Early on you kill an opressive prison bigshot and his gang (which is, incidentally, about half the civilian population of the starting village). The guy supposedly held the settlement in an iron grip by controlling distribution of food.   What changes after his death? Nothing. Literally nothing. Not even a single comment from the liberated, except one line from the quest giver. Guards continue to patrol the corpse-stewn yard, wading through actual pools of blood.    At this point I'd like to remind you that we are discussing a game universally praised for its systemic approach and reactivity.  I rest my case.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Yeah, no.   - The worldbuilding is painfully uninspiring - The fabled reactivity amounts to a couple of cosmetic dialog options here and there plus several gimmicks (stealing faces, talking to cows, putting out fire with water) - Biggest problem: it is a game about turn-based combat where combat means yawn-inducing ability spam and camera wrestling - The graphics are nice, I guess   It's the first Dragon Age all over again, minus cringey romance plus less interesting fights. Can't believe I'm saying this, but even the current crop of faux-Infinity RPGs is better.   Then again, maybe I'm just getting old."

A con though is that the difficulties isnt mere: More/Less HP or dmg, but the enemies changing their whole attack pattern. F.e. In tactician(hard) mode we hade a fight where they bursted our group in the first round with tons of elemental combos, when in Classic(normal) mode the same enemy encounter on the same level didnt use any element even once in the whole fight.  Feeling whise its going from 'Naked in a Snowstorm' to 'Idle on a Caribbean Beach'. Thats only from Hard to Normal, cant imagine the Very Hard mode.

I don't know if resemblance was intentional but I can't help but think of a few games that this game reminds me of however, often I don't hold it to that and because I just want to play Diviniy II, as Divinity II. I wont describe it (being the games it resembles and the game itself) because I feel that takes away from the spectacular creation that is Divinity Original Sin II, after all. the creators have no doubt been influenced, but in the best ways ever possible.  They took glorious ancient concepts and with a few unique features I've only see them do, and make it all their own. Plus it is a game you will have enjoyed 10 to 100 if not 1000 times more if you just go in.

They will be your primary teachers as you learn how to fight. - Very pretty  Cons: - Huge character variability inevitably leads to steep learning curves for some encounters - Similarly variety will make you want to reroll and start over several times until you're happy with a party - AoE and surface generation can make it difficult to use classic magic user strategy. Friendly AoE generally owns party members as much as enemies - Some matchups can be brutal depending on your composition - Is your party mostly magic/poison damage?  Better hope you don't face undead...  Have mostly melee champs?  Those archers are going to ruin you... - Still a number of bugs, though mostly not gamebreaking and fixes are actively being worked on by Larian Studios  All in all,  you can't go wrong with this one.

Pros: + Amazing gameplay; well improved over Original Sin 1 with quite a few extra mechanics + Delicious graphics; well suited for the genre  + Story is improved compared to the previous game + Interesting characters; especially your companions (rolled with Fane, Sebille and The Red Prince) + Content-heavy; can find quests and interesting things in every corner of the map + Great co-op (up to 4 players); loads of fun when playing with friends, works very well + Good price/hours ratio, especially if you include replayability and multiplayer  Cons: - Very weird difficulty curve; had a tougher time with battles in Act 2 than the final boss. - Some battles are totally not fun; [VERY MILD SPOILERS] who ever designed the Scarecrow battle should be whipped in the public square - Game is sometimes very cheesy; prepare to cheese it from time to time in order to compensate - Some side-quests seem to be cut short; development seemed rushed in some areas - Minor bugs and balance issues (some have been patched at the time of writing the review)  Overall, a solid sequel to the original Original Sin (heh).

Even if you're not interested in turn-based combat, the way Divinity handles it is so unique that it sets itself apart from any other RPG like it.  I highly encourage RPG fans of all strokes to play this game as it's the closest thing we've had to a true RPG in years."
1287,Psytric,191,2,0,2017-09-18,Recommended,44.2,"An absolutely stellar game.  One of the best cRPGs in years, with, in my opinion, the best combat system ever.  Pros: - Excellent writing - Great voice-acting - Absolutely spectactular combat  - Huge variation in character development - Multiple ways to accomplish just about any task - Tons of hidden gems secreted away throughout your journeys - A number of innovative systems, like the Physical/Magical armor system, companions whose class you can choose when they join your party, and many others - Great coop experience - Well executed battlefield construction - high ground, cover are very important concepts to utilize in combat with serious bonuses - Fantastic AI - Enemies and friends alike don't blunder through dangerous terrain, enemies use battlefield to great effect.  They will be your primary teachers as you learn how to fight. - Very pretty  Cons: - Huge character variability inevitably leads to steep learning curves for some encounters - Similarly variety will make you want to reroll and start over several times until you're happy with a party - AoE and surface generation can make it difficult to use classic magic user strategy. Friendly AoE generally owns party members as much as enemies - Some matchups can be brutal depending on your composition - Is your party mostly magic/poison damage?  Better hope you don't face undead...  Have mostly melee champs?  Those archers are going to ruin you... - Still a number of bugs, though mostly not gamebreaking and fixes are actively being worked on by Larian Studios  All in all,  you can't go wrong with this one.  Just an absolutely wonderful game, a real ""holy??????it's 4am"" experience that will infiltrate your dreams and daydreams."

I've also not made it past Fort Joy (the beginning right after the tutorial) yet as ive repeatedly restarted, playing around with different builds and such. But i am having a fantastic time with it. i havent enjoyed an RPG so much since Dragon Age Origins, nor have i wanted to smash my screen so much since initially discovering the Dark Souls games. I havent really played the first even though i own it so im not sure how it compares but i just might have to go play though it after this one.  Thank God for autosave, whether it be trying to survive an underground fight club at level 2-3 or dying to teleporting crocodiles, it has come in handy many times already.  I cant comment on the storyline so much yet as i havent really gotten into it yet but the origin stories seem interesting and custimization (even for origin characters) is fantastic.   In short if you enjoy RPG's and dont want to button smash your way to victory but actually use some strategy than this game is for you. You get a real feeling of accomplishment when you finally beat those ??????? teleporting crocodiles after 30-45 mins and 5-6 reloads.  Oh and graphics/optimization seem to be pretty great too, am running on max settings with no lag nor have come across any bugs as of yet although i still have a ways to go obviously.

1515,Alariq,278,2,0,2017-09-18,Recommended,65.9,"Yes, I would reccomend this game. Is it the best thing since the invention of pizza since people are claiming? Not really.  The Good:  - Very Pretty Graphics / Reasonably optimized - Great Customization - Fully voiced, great overall quality of acting - Good world building and lore, main story can be a bit convoluted at times. - Reasonably Balanced  The Bad:  - I'm not very fond of a couple of combat systems. I think they have overdone the surface system. Every combat , even the tiniest ones end up a swirling chaos of destruction everywhere with burning/poison/shock/blood what have you everywhere. - Mobs instantly spawn on conveniently placed vantage points to harass you all the time. It's less about organic fights and more like forcing you to reload because you were exploring and not ready for a fight to spawn from thin air. This kinda creates the feeliing that the game is bending the rules against you, cheapening the experience overall. - Mediocre tutorial overall. Fails to tell you some key details like Lizards don't need shovels and skeletons don't need lockpicks. - Some bugs, like only half you party entering combat while the other half watches. You have to manually move your characters into combat, even though they are right there in the first place.  All in all, if you're a fan of CRPGs you'll likely enjoy this as I have. but, if you're new to the genre, there are more friendly places to start."

18,Black Hammer,806,224,11,2017-09-18,Not Recommended,55.8,"Really disappointed with the game. It does a lot of things well, but falls flat on its face in two categories.  Encounter Design and writing.  As someone who has played, run, and occasionally written RPGs, D:OS 2 feels amateurish when it comes to both those things. The encounter feels extremely samey, with nearly all enemies functioning the same. Almost every enemy's kit follows a checklist of AoE status effect, teleport, and heal. Their AI consists of picking a target, then dogpiling that target regardless of positioning or self preservation. Enemies will walk through fire, burn themselves down to 1HP, and be set to die next turn just to get in one more hit on target prime. Heck, they'll stand around without attacking or just spend all their AP moving if they can't attack said target. They ignore Oppotunity Attacks and Taunt effects, so the only way to prevent this is to kill or stun them.  Doesn't help that most fights take place in the same sort of unfriendly terrain. Enemies get high ground, player gets hazards. Enemies get to magically appear from nowhere in flanking positions, player gets deployed in a clump regardless of formation settings.  Enemy damage scales extremely quickly, but since they don't actually have gear, the player doesn't benefit from this. Pickpocket an archer NPC before a fight, and you find three gold and an empty bottle. During the fight, he will merrily pop multiple consumables, like explosive arrows or healing potions. He didn't have these before the fight, and if you kill him before he would have a chance to use them, he wouldn't drop them, either. Same for gear. The enemy archer will have better armor than your tank, and do more damage with his bow, but someone on death all his equipment vanishes into the ether.  Or occasionally you'll get a pair of common quality gloves two levels behind, which he clearly wasn't wearing since they would never get his armor that high.  The story of the game is stock for the Divinity series, which to be fair has always embraced the PC as special snowflake story trope. The character dialogue is iffy, but the plot frequently feels forced or out of touch with the situation.  Kill a named NPC, said NPC returns in the next scene. If you let me burn someone to a charred corpse on screen, then animate a disgusting blob zombie with his corpse, that character should probably not pop up again.  Overall, the game frequently feels like it was set up by a new or just plain bad GM. ""These are my favorite NPCs, you can't kill them. I put them in fights, but they magically survive or escape. No, you can't loot or use their equipment, because I don't want you to look as cool as them. Haha, look how dumb you are, being ambushed by invisible enemies I made magically appear even though you were standing where they were a minute ago."" Most of the game's challenge comes from this, rather than any real feel of difficulty.   Few additional weird design choices: Initiative is I go-you go, meaning boosting initiative is meaningless, since you will always take turns with the enemy.  Status effects are blocked by armor/magic armor, meaning these have to be stripped before you can apply effects. This seems fair, until you realize enemies have more armor and do more damage than you. Meaning they can frequently fire off these abilities and land them on the first hit, while you have to spend a turn or two chewing down armor.  The armor mechanic also means you are best off focusing on one type of damage, preferably physical due to fewer resists. So in a game with six different kinds of spellcasting, one of the better teams is four 2h warriors bashing everything to death while spamming fly or teleport.  Many enemies have flat out immunities to certain effects, for no clear reason. (A clear reason is something like a fire elemental being resistant to burning.) There is no way to predict this, so you can go into a fight only to find the damage types and status effects your party is built for are worthless for a given encounter.  Graphics are nice. Gameplay has a lot of potential, but the encounter design lets it down. I'm in the 2nd act, and I'm sick of the fights. You get access to a wonderful variety of abilities, but you're best off running a party of all physical attackers and the odd utility spell.  I want to like it. I think a really good game could be made out of the foundation D:OS2 is built on, but so far, Larian hasn't done it.  On the bright side, it is way better than Dragon Commander was."
321,ahnkra,147,20,1,2017-09-18,Not Recommended,35.7,"What can I say, this game would be awesome if:  1. It was balanced.  Right now even the easiest setting is a blood bath!  You are always out numbered at the start and it seems every encounter has atleast one or more npcs which either summon adds, or the game just cheats and throws more adds in as the battle progresses. 2. NPCs played by the same rules as the characters.  an NPC the same level as your character will always have more HP, will always have more Regular Armor and more Magic Armor (these are two seperate things in this game) will always have more skills and more resists and this is at the easiest setting.  Also NPCs can cheat and shoot arrows and cast spells through things that block your attacks. Like wise human like NPCs seem to have infinite special ammo (like fire arrows and poison bombs) and Monstrous NPCs constantly spam their AOE/status altering attacks. 3. Every battle ground is staged against you.  The enemy always has the high ground for ranged attacks, requiring you to navigate 2 or 3 turns to get on even footing and away from the preplaced barrels of fun that get exploded for your enjoyment er uhm death.  All the while your enemies, enjoying all this carefully placed stuff are wearing you down and spamming the entire battle field with fire / ice / poison etc.. 4. Even if you are the kind of person who enjoys reloading and trying the same battle over 10 times or more to figure out how to beat any particular fight, you will still be upset when the game crashes while your doing one of those reloads, or the save you have been reloading over and over again gets corrupted and cant be loaded, Or you finally win the fight only to discover that one of those negative status effects that got applied during the battle, never comes off afterwards, oh and the quest that was supposed to be updated / completed doesnt get updated or completed either.  All that said, there is a real diamond in the rough here.  Graphics are amazing, Music / sound is nice (i havnt been tempted to turn it off yet,) and what little i have been able to see of the quests / roleplaying part of the game has left me wanting more and more (which makes me ever more frustrated with all the above that keeps me from persuing the actual game.) I'm gona take a few days to cool off, then let a few weeks pass by and see if they have had a chance to work on their bugs and balancing issues.  IF your considering buying, I'd wait too."

The default RNPC skills on level are very bad, and that handicaps the early game - though, of course that ends up being less of a bother around the time you get out of the first non-tutorial area (Fort Joy).  Because of the heavy RNG in the loot aspect of the game, there's no reliable way to get good enough gear to handle all the various shenanigans that the enemies will throw at you - and, on hard or ironman mode, they'll throw a lot of shenanigans your way.  But then suddenly you'll gear up and combats will swing hugely and go from either interesting or too hard (so much RNG reliance! If I wanted to play XCOM I'd just play that, thanks) to boring or too easy.  Backed this game on Kickstarter for the CE because of how much I enjoyed the first D:OS game; put 80-90 hours in the first one, co-op, plus another 50+ single-player.  Didn't even hit ten hours on this game before uninstalling.  What a disappointing way to follow-up one of the best co-op RPGs in recent memory."

Cons - boring story. Nothing exciting or new to the genre. - the quest system was a little confusing. I was left with many unfinished quests when departing each zone. - I found it quite linear. Although it appears open world, there are 4 set zones (which you cant travel between) and within those zones you are kind of forced to do certain parts one by one as each section's NPC's are a certain level.  - I found the character creation a bit confusing.  - no new unique mechanics appear to be introduced to the turn based genre.

EDIT:: After playing through the game multiple times, including finishing it on Honour Mode, I have to say that my opinion of this game is even higher than it was after those first 20 hours. After finishing this game, it feels like my life is complete and there's nothing left to live for. This may be the last game I ever play and review I ever write. I would like to thank Larian for filling a void that has been plaguing me for more than half a century.  I found the main story as well as every single side quest/story to be fun and interesting. There are no boring fetch quests as far as I can tell. How you handle side quests and whether you complete them or not 'does' affect the ending; as such, they could be considered extensions of the main story. (You could be unsatisfied with the ending if you just rush through and skip things.)  You can build your characters any way you see fit and almost any build is completely viable. If you don't like the way you built your characters, just wait until you complete Act 1 and you can rebuild them any way you want as frequently as you want all the way up to the very end of the game; this is very good for testing new things out. By the end of the game my main character was a fire breathing Geo/Pyro battle mage that wielded a fire staff, used Warfare skills and showered my enemies in meteors with some necromancy for physical damage in case the enemy had too much resistance to those elements; she was pretty godly. I plan on trying a solo Honour mode run next with a similar but more diverse build. (I love the lizards!)  For me, the best part of this game is the combat. It's extremely well done and very fun. I can't really say any more than what the other reviews cover though. Just know that if a fight seems absolutely impossible, that it really isn't. I've gone into fights where half my party was annihilated before I got to do anything, yet I still emerged victorious. There's always a way to win even if the enemy has you outnumbered and outleveled; just gotta think!  Like many reviews state, there are still some bugs. As far as I can tell, they are all minor. After multiple play throughs on multiple difficulties I have not experienced any major bugs. Nothing game breaking and nothing that really affected my gameplay much.  The few bugs I've experienced:  - Many unvoiced lines in Arx.  - Incorrect journal entries.  - Sometimes a character would act blind in combat even though they weren't (could't use any ranged skills, couldn't see around themselves, but this was rare and only lasted a single turn.)  - Sometimes the enemy AI would derp out and they'd just run around or repeatedly climb up and down a ladder until they were out of AP.  - Custom undead characters do not receive the appropriate immunities, such as bleeding and suffocation. (though I don't recall any of my characters ever being afflicted with Bleed...) (Fane does receive these immunities)  - Undead afflicted with Decay will not attempt to avoid poison puddles (Not sure if this is a bug or an oversight).  - Altitude does not affect many player or enemy melee attacks. (Entities 10+ meters above can be struck with melee.) But it does affect some skills, such as Dragon's Blaze, Laser Ray, charging skills, Battle Stomp, etc.  ... I think that's about it. I'll add more if I remember them.  Some reviews complain about enemies being omniscient and knowing all of your strengths and weaknesses (including whether you're undead or not), which is true, but it's also true for players. Any player with Loremaster on one of their characters can examine any NPC or enemy to gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Only one of your characters needs Loremaster. If you examine with someone that doesn't have it, they use the skill level of whoever does, even if that person is dead. (This even works on the final boss, at no point in the game is it unfair that enemies can spot your weaknesses.)  So in summary, very fun game, great character customization, great combat, good story, a few minor bugs. It can be challenging in some scenarios but it's supposed to be; that's at least half the fun. I could mention the poor inventory management but countless reviews already cover that.  Tip: Carry a couple pieces of +Thievery and +Loremaster gear with you to make sure you can pick any lock and identify any item. There may be times when your base skill isn't sufficient.   TL;DR: Recommended, as shown above. 10/10 on the Completely Subjective, Arbitrary and Useless rating system."

191,Heaveness,173,21,1,2017-09-19,Recommended,127.8,"I wanted to put at least minimum 20 hours into this game before I gave it a review. I can safely say that this is one of the best RPG games you will ever find, it's one of those games that will earn the definition of classic cRPG decades later. Normally I don't play a lot of turn-based tactical RPGs in my lifetime because I find the genre not my biggest interest but this game did a fantastic job enticing me into its universe.   Q: How does the game run? Any bugs or crashes or technical issues? A: In 30 hours of playing I have encounter maybe 1 or 2 bugs but I find them minor, for example, some quests did not classify as finished when I just got the reward for it. I have not experienced a single crash in any of my games and did not run to any framerate issues.  Q: Do you recommend it or not? A: Absolutely recommend it! The game is very well-made, the developers really poured their heart and soul into this game and it shows. It has online & local splitscreen coop, PvP, Tactical combat, controller support, mods, great writing, so much paths and methods to tackle any quest, Game Master Mode, and much more. I can tell the Larian Studios had a blast making this and it's thanks to them and the kickstarters backers that help fund this fantastic game.  Overall score: 10/10 Pros:  +Fun and challenging tactical combat  +Easy to get into but hard to master +Interesting and unique characters with the companions having their own origin stories. +Mod Support +A well-implemented coop feature that doesn't feel tacked on. +Beautiful Soundtrack +Definitely more than 100 hours of content. +Very well polished with little to no bugs or crashes and haven't experienced any framerate issues so far. +Game Master Mode which is a DnD style game which is a interesting way to play the game with friends. +Multiple ways to tackle an objective. +You have a ton of freedom and choice. +The graphics look great with some pretty locations. +So much secrets and this game encourages to carefully look and explore its world.  Neutral: =The voice acting for the most part is good but some are odd and feels inconsistent when it comes to the audio quality but it does its job. =The quest journal I find to be a clunky with the map. When you have multiple quests active, you have multiple markers on the map that just seems messy and confusing. Although it is not hard to figure out what you are suppose to be doing. =A few quality-of-life changes would have been nice like increasing the walking speed outside of combat or having the hotbar not be cluttered whenever you pick up an item like a grenade. Luckily these two problems can be fixed with a mod.  Cons: -Honestly there is zero cons I can think of for this game, other than on higher difficulties the enemies like to use a lot of cheese tactics which can be frustrating to deal with but you can use those same tactics on them too.  I'll definitely play this game much more and I have still a lot more content to explore and be playing them with my friends whenever I get the chance. I highly recommend you get this game, I gave it a 10/10 rating not as a ""This game is perfect in every way,"" the game has a few issues, but it's more of a ""This game is worth every penny of your purchase"" kind of rating. Pick this game up for yourself or with 3 other friends, you will not regret it! "

237,Berry humerus,101,21,0,2017-09-19,Recommended,78.4,"Amazing game! I suck at reviews, but know that this game is a beautiful world.  Personally to me feels very handcrafted instead of how alot of newer games tend to feel cut and pasted. PROS +game design- if you think through all situations and are willing to die a few times trying there are many different ways to complete any situation. +graphics- my pc is not grand(base alianware alpha I3 until i pay my house down and build my new pc this winter) and i run this game at 1440p high graphics and around 30 fps( never dipping below) +choice-i truely feel like i have a say at some parts of this game( hence i said someparts, this is very clsoe to a pen and paper but does fall short as will all games every played with any type of AI, it is just in the nature.) +difficulty- i know this has been a hot subject since alot of people are finding the game a little to difficult but it is my own opinion, i play on tactition mode, have 1.) undead poly, ranger. 2.)normal summoner lohse. 3.) normal rouge sibille. 4.) normal geo, warfare beast.  and i find the enocunters to be very difficult but i really enjoy a true challenge, as well as a challenge to know when i am out matched( does not happen often for most games now a days with all the monsters leveling with you. eg The Elder Scrolls Online, )i do enjoy that game too.)) +balance- while this is not a perfect positive i felt it worth noting. no game can be perfectly balenced but i feel as though my build setup(see note above) is far from perfect and yet i play on the hardest normal difficulty. and to me that is saying something, i did not feel like i had to play a certain way to enjoy the harder fights.  now for some of the bad i did notice.  -the number one thing i saw in this game that was missing... it is most likely something small to most but enemys and other npcs have things on their body that is not in their inventory. now i dont mind not having the armour and weapons, i would feel like i would be overwelmed with over powered things that would make me feel to powerfull( i dont enjoy that it gets boring, i like the fight just to stay in the fight.) but if i could use my rouge to sneak and replace a healing potion with a poison bottle, that would change the game for me. allow me to steal things( if i was tacticle about manuvering the land not to get caught.) that might hinder my teammates useless for fights. i just feel like that would be the cherry atop the already iced and sprinkled cake. -difficulty- i personally understand why alot of people dont like the way the game was made more (difficult) with it only being a stat buff to the enemys, and a rather drastic one at that, so i think there could be more difficulty modes, and take the one good thing from ark Survival evolved and add a slider for a custom difficulty( this is supposed to mimic a pen and paper like dnd give the players the choice.   there are more pros and cons to this game, but these were the ones i felt i would want to know about if i were trying to decide on buying this or not.  for me this game is a solid 10/10 there is room for improvment in any game but give credit where it is do. this game deserves it, it is rather a amazing title.  P.S. this is one of the maybe 4-7 games i have bought non-steamsale. i do not regret it at all and would very much recomend it to single player or multiplayer. thank you for reading this far and i hope this review helped you make a decision.( ask any questions you guys may have and i will do my best to answer!)  EDIT*  one more thing that I thought of that I personally feel should be fixed, as far as combat goes I don't mind the stat buff or the enemy having shorter cool down for skills then you do.  with that said the game should not allow an enemy to have free range of sight, what I mean is I have seen so many times that if I am in range but not within line of sight a enemy can hit you but not vice versa.  to me this is far from a game breaking bug. but it is the only way I feel gimped in any true way cause I cant truly have all power over placing my troops since ( in some cases) enemys could fire through that brush that I hid behind while shooting the other guy, with that said it also does not happen that often."

I can see myself putting 50+ hours in the campaign and then many more in the gamemaster mode  -anytime I clear any default keybinds and leave empty they are binded to the default again next time I play -map markers will stay after objective is completed  -the journal sometimes lacks important information that you'd expect in a quest log (similar to the first game) -trading with characters can sometimes be annoying when you can't access party members items -Early game enemies have much better armor and abilities  Overall a fantastic game that has few flaws.

A very hard game but once you are familiar with the mechanics of the game and spend time to level up a bit its managable.  Time will fly when you play this, be warned.  Still very fun even if you solo, can't comment on co-op. Game ran fine, no crashes even after 30 hrs.  Does support Ultra wide and graphics improved a touch over part 1.  Gears are  varied and shows great detail when equipped.  Good replayability as there are plenty of classes to choose from and you won't always get same results as your previous playthrough.  I restarted couple times and few missions i had different result but can't pinpoint why.  If you loved the first, this is a no brainer."
471,Lazarus,238,4,0,2017-09-19,Recommended,253.3,"27 hours in the game and I haven't even left Fort Joy. Literally... I haven't broken out. I convinced my best friend to join me and we have been hacking away at anything and anyone who seemed like a bad guy. Breaking the game mechanics is legitamately half the fun here. We managed to sneak our way past Magisters by using the teleport spell. Somehow... we always managed to take the back door into every dungeon.   We couldn't stop getting ourselves in trouble at every turn. By the way, getting into trouble is just part of the fun. Speaking of which, be ready to quick save a ton. The developers were kind enough to give 5 quick save slots along with auto saves and unlimited hard saves... Unless you're playing on that insane 4th difficulty, in which you have just the 1 save and a total party kill is very very bad. You basically get your save erased on the hardest difficulty if everyone dies.   Pros: -Break the game dammit. Just do it! I swear finding ways to navigate and utterly cheese your way around a level is amazing. We saved a paladin just by teleporting everyone up to the second floor of the castle, then knock down the ladder, and then sneak to the front door... only to get prepared for a massive fight just before the doors swing open and  a Knight and Battle Mage just flat out turn into hulking battering rams that decimate the first guy they see. The amount of planning that you can make for a battle is amazing... I even got a chance to set up environmental hazards for the enemies by moving poison barrels and oil barrels ahead of a fight.   -The sneaking system is hilarious, but well maintained. Seeing a lizard tail poke out from under a barrel makes me giggle. The enemy vision scales down with higher thievery skills.  -The turn based fighting system is the best I have seen yet. It really feels like a ton of heart and effort has gone into this portion of the game. You need to see it to understand just how much it is like a legitamate DnD pen and paper style turn based system. It brings that niche genre to an immediate resurrection and breathes new life into it. Trust me, if you get this game for any reason, and you like turn based strategy, this is the very reason to get giddy like a damn school girl. The battle system alone is a game changer and was an insta buy for me and my friend.  -Choices, choices, choices. Choose wisely or shoot yourself in the foot... or shoot your friend in the foot... or shoot that annoying cat and feed it to the elf. I'm not joking, that cat is in the way all the time. I can't go 5 seconds without accidently lighting it on fire. The dialogue system is very well done and the choices you make will certainly matter. You can miss massive side quests that actually are very important to the overall story and your well being. Other mission and quests are just there to get your butt into a ton of trouble just because you said ""what's the worst that could happen?"". Everything... Just be careful with your choices. You may also live with any and every choice you make. Bad decisions can follow you and from the looks of it, can have consequences on the quests that get closed off because someone had a bad attitude with you or they got shanked unsuspectedly when you were looking the other direction. However, even bad decisions seem to lead down some interesting paths.   -Dialogue is absolutely amazing. Every character and NPC I have met so far is voiced and has a good feeling to their emotions. They always feel genuine, so far. I have yet to meet an NPC that had seemed overly annoying or out of place. The voice actors have done a really good job. My favorite part is the narrator, who has a soothing englishman's accent and doesn't feel snobby. Once again, props to the voice actors.  Neutral: -Have yet to experience the Game Master mode, yet the tutorial makes it out to be a true Dungeon Master style with 4 players under the control of the DM. You can make full campaigns and there are a literal sh*t ton of options. Just look up Game Master Tutorial on YouTube, which was made by the devs, and you'll see what I mean.  -If you don't pick one of the Main Characters, you may be missing out on massive parts of the story. Do not worry. If you create a custom character, you still have the option of taking 3 of the main characters along in your quests. Each main character has their own story and ambitions. Be sure to pay attention to them as they may lead you down some very interesting paths.  Cons: -I am legit am coming up short for things I do not like. There were some minor bugs when the game first released, but the devs seem to have a fast response time and are working diligently on most of the problems we were experiencing. In fact, most of the major issues disappeared on the first week. Sooooo... these are not the cons you are looking for..."

I'm about 38 hours in and oh my god im so happy i purchased it. There is so much gameplay, quests, goofs, amazingness, etc.   It truely makes me want to do every single quest and I get sad if I miss anything. The companions are great I personally have hydro mage, rouge awesomeness elf, and handsome hunter. I also want to completere their own stories because its just so interesting to experience.   The fact that most people hate me cause I'm a lizard is cool because the story rotates on what race you are as well. I might even make a second character just to see the reactions and how playing with different companions play out.

Adding in extra races, characters with origin stories that actually effect the story of the game, having a storyline that makes more sense then the last game and adding in romance options has really created an atmosphere that exeeds the previous game.  Adding in more spells (a new school has been added; Polymorph) and adding physical armour and magic armour instead of just health has really expanded on the combat.  The only con to this game is the quests and the way that they are explained/the player is directed. This was a problem in the previous game, where if you don't do the quest exactly as the game wants it, you won't complete it. As well as this, the game once again doesn't explain quests adequetly. Quests will have very vague references that leave the player running around entire maps not understanding what the next step is. This was a very big problem for me in the Driftwood area, where there were a lot of quests, but I was given literally nothing to give me a clue as where to go.

703,Skankinpig,59,3,0,2017-09-19,Recommended,36.7,"I'll start by saying i've not played all that far through the story - I've had multiple starts due to purchasing just prior to release and a Co-op partner who seems to enjoy playing several classes before sticking to one.   Interestingly enough, this has had the positive of showing me just how different the game can be with different class combinations. We've played combos where it seems that no matter how careful we are, the battlefield inevitably becomes a blanket of different elemental affects indiscriminately maiming everybody on it and we've had more tactical groups that have more control over such affects, without the volatile power behind their attacks.   We've settled on a slightly more understated group, methodically using status affects to control the flow of battle and tip it into our favour.   The game is beautiful looking, it's as deep as you wish it to be and the sheer amount of detail in the world is amazing. The UI is simple without being restrictive, the game will guide you without holding your hand and through that allows you to make your mistakes, or genius discoveries and whichever it be, you're left with under no illusion: That was your doing, for better or worse.   I always want to like games like this but often find the world doesn't feel alive enough, is to linear or awkwardly open to its own detriment - the balance is never quite right, but here, for me at least it has been struck and i've really enjoyed exploring and experimenting.   tldr:   The game is generally well polished, fun and of good depth. Looks beautiful, with an interesting story and the world feels richer for it. Worth a buy from any RPG fan, especially if like me, an rpg feeling like an MMO with no players in it just feels like an empty experience to you - you wont find that here."

I looked in a mirror and saw that I'd aged 60 years, my jowls sagged, leathery eyelids hung heavy over my now grey faded eyes. I looked outside and saw the changed world. The people wore such strange clothing, some wore suits of purple fur with their faces painted into crude animal caricatures, other people wore shoes on their hands and gloves on their feet, but nothing else.

This is an old-school top down RPG like we played in the late 90s but rather than being a game that feels like it could have been released in 2000 and then teleported to 2017 (like Pillars of Eternity), it feels like what these games would be if the genre didn't just vanish but rather continued to evolve over the last 15 years.   The turn-based combat is fantastic. It actually feels tacitcal and when you figure out a clever way to approach a battle and then win, it is very satisfying. If you play for tactical combat, you'll love it. If you play RPGs for an engaging story and world, you'll love it. If you love tinkering with builds and different class comps, you'll love it. If you love reactivity, freedom, and choice and consequence - you will love it.  If you think you might possibly enjoy this game - buy it, you will not regret it.

Lots to explore, fun battles and many choices to make, all of which felt like they were important. Character creation and leveling was great fun, as could build however you wanted. I really didnt like my character at the start and was thinking about restarting, but after I started getting gear that improved my other scores, and let me learn spells from other schools of magic I started to really love it, in the end having a Elementalist Staff wielder, making for great moments of being able to summon ice storms and lazor beams.  However, it all goes downhill near the end. Arx is where the final act takes place, and looks very promising at first. That is until you have to spend many many hours searching for anything to move your quests along, or spoil it all by looking at a walkthrough.   (Spoilers!) I think many will agree with me that finding Arhu is the hardest part in the game, not because its a good puzzle, but because you get so little infomation to go on. Gave up so many times, and ended up just killing people to try and find any clues, such as the toymaker, which I was trying to avoid. Hopefully they change the final act and make it easier to find clues. The final battle for me was rather anticlimatic as well, after which I had to make a choice. It was all very abrupt, and just well, happened, not much of a build up or anything. Others may have found it better than me though.

SO the good things about this game: The story/writing has vastly been improved saince the first game, I loved the first one but the story never really pulled me in, this one however pulls me in within the first hour. The combat is still as fun and tactical as the first, with far more combinations of spells and abilities (plus waaayyy more spells, classes and abilities in general). The character creation is fun, its not too long and crazy but allows you to make (or customize an existing character) to be the character you wanna play. The companions are all detailed with decent stories and they all have different impacts on the storyline and each other. Gamemaster Mode is incredible fun, it feels like the D&D campaign creator I've always wanted. This game has up to 4 player multiplayer for the full game, so if you have the friends jump into this with them.   Few neutral things: The music is kind of average, a few fun tunes but feels generic. The crafting system is no longer a cluster of confusing rubbish, so its not a negative, it still doesn't feel very important though, on my solo playthrough and playthrough with friend we both ignore it as it feels still not that useful. Arena mode is a rare giggle but feels kind of incomplete. While its very true many quests allow you to do them  in different ways which is fab, some of them matter little, you will be given like 5 options (if you find them all) to finish a certain part however, you can just run back and do the other options for extra xp for killing them (as I do) making the choice slightly pointless.  Bad things for me (or things I think others will hate): The amount of races is fun (including undead versions), however, it feels like every race is here in vast quantities, no race feels rarer. If you do not like turn based combat this game is NOT FOR YOU AT ALL. Your characters pathing when you tell them to go someone in a fight will still decide to  casually run through fire/poison etc, or sometimes attacks of opportunity make ZERO sense. Gamemaster Mode has no way of making character talk, its all up to the GM. Now this last comment is something that just personally annoys me, but when you need to  help a character in a fight (or save them) they have this tendency to just go full in and take huge quantities of damage, they seem to have dumb AI compared to actual enemies.  I hope my review gave some insight on whether to purchase this game."

74,Bob1004,149,54,4,2017-09-19,Not Recommended,43.3,"This game is maddening. But let's get the positives out of the way: The game has a great world and characters. I liked being part of the world. Magic is powerful and elemental combinations can be interesting. Normally I would consider this a good game and would heartily recommend it. It is a mechanically sound experience.  BUT  The game is a damned mess in execution. Bugs are ever present. And these are not graphical glitches. Quests conclude totally ignoring what you did in them. Not sure that it affects gameplay, but it is confusing to see it write the exact opposite of what you did into the journal.  But the biggest issue is that the game is unforgivably obtuse and lacks any structure in its story. I don't as much follow what is going on as stumble from one event to another, sometimes having dialogue options that I have no idea who it references or what is going on. There is absolutely no structure to the story. There are also nothing but vague hints on what are you supposed to do. This game made me rage quit an RPG, which has never happened before: After spending hours on the Nameless Island in front of a bloody gate that I have no idea how to open and only vague notions of where to proceed. This game explains nothing. Gives no hints where you are supposed to go or what to do. You just explore every corner of the map and occasionally things happen. I don't expect it to be a linear corridor, but I do expect story progression, not stumbling in the dark until something happens. I literally have no idea what am I supposed to do or where am I supposed to go. The journal itself is useless beyond recording (sometimes incorrectly) past events. It is absolutely possible to accidentally pass crucial plot details and have no idea what the bloody hell is going on. That is not 'freedom', it's bad story telling.  Also, I'm not invested in the actual story at all. You have to become Divine. Why? Because the game is called Divinity. This is just what Godwoken do on a Thursday I guess. Again, not sure because the story is lackluster or because I accidentally skipped half of the story by going into a cave.  Ultimately I'm not having fun. I'm increasingly confused and agitated by the game as it refuses to adhere to any structure. The opening was great, I had fun exploring the first islands, but everything is downhill from there. I wanted to like this, but when a game makes you yell profanities at the screen for 15 minutes, then it is no longer entertainment.  After playing this game, I can see that 'total freedom' is absolutely overrated and a terrible narrative device. Compare it to an Obsidian or Bioware RPG: Each is more restrictive and linear, but I have a grasp on what is going on, who the players are, etc. Hell, this game cannot properly remember that I choose one of their prebuilt characters, only adding to further confusion when it references events in dialogue that did not happen. Or when one character tells the other that it was not there somewhere where it absolutely was. Or when characters appear out of thin air with altered personality.  It is a mechanically sound narrative mess. And since I'm primarily interested in the narrative, I cannot with a good conscious recommend it."

The most irritating bug is one that prohibits you from compleating quests, if this is true rpg and your choices matter later in game. This will probably ruing my playthrough in future as my journal says i didn't do certain things, when on quests I have information that I have done it.  I cannot recommend this game until those big bugs are fixed (i don't mind programming text in dialogues and such as it doesn't affect the gameplay)"
578,Minde-LTU,102,2,1,2017-09-19,Not Recommended,169.8,"Very nyce game. It just has to much bugs. I seems that this game was released 3 months to early.   There could be some spoilers:  I found maybe 30 smaller bugs, and sevarl bigger: The final buttle to escape from Island - after I saved the game dissapered all my allies. Actually I did not realised, that's the bug, finished my several stories, come back, and they all missing. All my saves where used after that bug. Ok, I solo defeated the final bosses and escaped from island. But just because in classic mode the game for me was to easy, archer did not used any special arrows, I just used 1 ressurection scroll. All fights I finished with 80% helf. So the fights in classic mode are to easy.   And it's not tactical game. There are so much posibilities, that is not tactical game. For example enemy has teleporter. There are only sevaral common tactics. Put the archers on the top. And I used the trick to close the door. So I killed all magisters easy beeing  lvl 3. I let one magister fighter in the room, closed the door disabling magister archers and mages. Yes, that magister fither with dual sword was dealing damage 55, so with one critical hit or 2 normal hits he cut kill instantly my companions. But I  used the tactic that archers removed his armore (used the hart for double action points), and after that just knocked down him. It was the hardest fight for me, The second one hard fight was against the wich. But also, no oned died, I did not used any special arrow in any fight (just saving for hard fights).   I tried this game in hard mode. And hard mode is 2 or 3 times harder then cllassic. I prefer some game mode between classic and hard.   Yes, game is fune. If you fix one the most anoying bug and release more patches , I probably will delete this my negative review.   And the most anoying bug is fight vission system. It completely fails on some grounds. For example if some character is under the ark, he is out of vision in any way. If 2 charcaters are very close each other, but one is under ark, the second can't heal him or resurect or buff.   I could write the list with small issues, but I believe, that the developers already know them, there just prioritize releasing as fast as possible.  Ant this game is finished 98 or 99 %, but that 1% is annoying. I hate the bugs and hate rusing to release unfinished games."

Let me start off be saying be ware this game has NO quest log or min map markers, you are pretty much stuck in this big area with only vague glues or ideas on where you MIGHT go... As far as the combat side goes it's almost pain full to fight. You alwas feel out number and moving around during a fight is like pulling teeth. I would not recomend this any one unless you are a HARDCORE rpg player.  I would also like to sight another clear down side to this game (for me) I discovered today. Once a group of enemies is killed there is no respawn for them, witch basically means you will never be able to grind for levels and gear. I guess this is ok if your just playing to hear a story but if your farmer and enjoy grinding you will be sadly let down.  I am leaving this review up and not changing a thing, alot of people who knew what they where buying and are fans of the DOS series have had some pretty harsh criticisms on my review witch is fine.  About a dozen people have flamed me for not doing enough resreach about the game, honestly when I did read steam reviews about the game  along with a couple sights including ING and Gamestop, I never found one that mentioned any of these  qualities.

Side Note: Larian Studios has shown how much they care about the content they put out by giving you the best they can offer. Did you notice the price tag isn't $60? Did you notice the Divine Edition is only $15 but not at all game-changing or content locking from the base game? Did you notice the Game Master Mode wasn't a purchasable DLC? That is humility right there. They aren't trying to squeeze every last person for some money. They are looking to create quality content so that we can enjoy it at, for what you're buying, an extremely generous price. They knew the fan-base and what people wanted and how bad they wanted it.

1517,ShadyChicken,141,2,0,2017-09-20,Recommended,83,"TL:DR The game is ????in' awesome enough to make me say, ""Let me write a quick review"" and write a chunk of text. This is one of my first reviews. Buy the game.   Probably the best game I've played in a very long time. The character creation took me around an hour, the prolouge took me an hour, and the ""tutorial"" island has taken me around seven hours and counting of non-stop fun. I await the day I get off the island and see the whole game through. I'm starting to think that this ????ing island is the entire game, but I can tell that the developers put a lot of damn work into a marvelous game that will make you feel like you're sitting at the DnD table experiencing the best storyline of your lifetime.  The game is addicting, and hooks you with different storylines that make you want to come back onto the game everytime you open Steam. The combat is very difficult, yet very fun. The core element that makes the combat so fun is it's difficulty, it makes this ARPG have a sense of a RTS inside of it. You have to be smart about what moves you make, how you make them, and how you can use the enviornment around you to your advantage.   To give you an idea of how much I approve of this game, this is the first review I've ever really written (I've wrote a few half???????derpy ones before). I believe this game, and its hard working developers deserve the Game of the Year award due to the amount of work they put into a game that was funded by a KICKSTARTER!   This game shows you how GAMES are SUPPOSED to be made! This game isn't created by EA, Ubisoft, or some other company that pumps out half??????? unfinished games to the public yearly just to pump in cash from fans of the older games who want to see if they have FINALLY fixed their beloved franchise. You don't come across a Halo Reach or a childhood memory quality game often nowadays, but this game will make you feel like a child again wanting to come home already so you can hop on your character and continue the storyline that you left off engrossed in.  Please purchase this game if you love DnD, RPGs, RTSs, or anything of the sorts! These developers deserve the money, and YOU deserve a GOOD GAME for once instead of rubbish games like CALL OF DUTY INFINITE WARFARE!"

113,Pelmaleon,38,49,1,2017-09-20,Not Recommended,64.8,"One thumb up, one thumb down (mixed review)  Pros: Really good atmosphere, art, voice acting, writing, music, and charm.  Cons: Terrible design choices in the new armor system (0% crowd control or status affliction chance while armor is up and 100% chance while armor is down) - makes encounter solutions incredibly repetitive and thus fairly boring, as they are too easy to ""solve"" via chained, 100% success rate crowd control. Also, on tactician there are not more enemies, but instead enemies just get huge boosts to their stats (armor included), making fun, hybrid parties bad, pushing you to use a more-repetitive either all physical or all magical party. The first Divinity Original Sin also had more chance involved (hit/miss chance for both attacks and crowd control), which this sequel pretty much eliminated, which makes fights very snowbally and predictable (and thus somewhat boring) towards the mid to end portions of the fight.  Poor, lazy loot design choice as every level up your lower level equipment becomes extremely outclassed by current level equipment found by tediously going to merchants and buying their newly updated wares. Also, loot attributes are randomized on most equipment so loot while adventuring feels way less special and lovable as you ditch them frequently for current-level loot with higher numbers (feels like Diablo 3 or Borderlands - games with the same lazy, constant slow-drip dopamine design choice).  Only 4 action points without a way to increase them (unless using OP lone wolf), makes fights much less tactical compared to the first Divinity: Original Sin 1 in which you slowly increased your action points as the game progressed, allowing fun combos. In this game you will use your most powerful skills/spells at the start of almost every single fight and then your second most powerful skills in the second round. Also, because action points are more sparse, scrolls and potions are used less frequently as they take precious action points away from using the aforementioned most powerful skills/spells. It makes the combat much more repetitive than the first Divinity: Original Sin.  Initiative system is botched. The turn order is now a round robin system as enemies always get a turn in between your characters, no matter how high your or their initiatives are. This makes fun multiple character combos less possible as enemies will often move or teleport before you have a chance to perform the full combo. Example: one character casts rain on the floor, enemy moves out of the water, and your second character can no longer electrocute the water with a lightning spell.  Stats are dumbed-down. Google Divinity:OS 1's stats and then Divinity:OS 2's stats and see the difference for yourself.  Small selection of damage-dealing magic spells (with many of them locked behind the anti-fun source system which forces you to spend a few and far between source points to use them).  Conclusion: If you liked the first Divinity Original Sin you will probably enjoy this one as well, even though most combat mechanics were changed for the worse. If you are looking for a superb, deep crpg experience similar to the past greats like Baldur's Gate, you may be disappointed."

I'm not into co-op, so can't evaluate that. Combat system is very different, especially in the way and overused fire dominates it. So far I'm more frustrated than challenged, and bored by the sluggishness than engaged with the moderately deep systems.  The game seems to force you to stay in first town to learn systems, level up, and find allies, even though the town is bland, sterile and very one dimensional. I'm finding the game a slog, like I did with DOS, so I guess it follows its predecessor well. Not so excited but will struggle on."

400,Gordon the Otter,576,10,1,2017-09-20,Not Recommended,392.5,"edit: i recomend playing past act 2 of the game to fully understand what i mean in my review, because acts 1 and 2 are amazing and i know many people will see that over the later parts of the game  the game starts out fantastic, but it solve dissolves into crypic riddles and secrets yoru just suposed to know. the puzzles start giving less hints and arent connected to anything at the finial part of the game your suposed to figure out all on yoru own where a serect vault is under a house to which that is the only information given to you as a hint. and near the end you fight enemies in which respawn apon death, i had to switch to the easiest mode to pass them due to the glitchy mess some late game areas are, not to excuse their lack of explination. the endings are also a muddy choice of ""because i was told do to"" and none of the characters properly respond to why you did somethign, only that it was done, i cant become divine for them and help them and myself, the game assume i became divine to help only myself. the only time the game mostly sees you as a hero is when you basicly kill yourself, to which again no character properly reacts to it [explination is a spoiler]  you can kill the current god than choose to remove source [what the current god wants to do] and the game rolls with the idea you just submitted to the current god, rather than kill him   the game as of this moment is worth playing, but it does not feel  worth buying.  If you had the intentions of playing with a friend, be warrned the game treats both of you as the main player so both of you have to talk to the same characters a lot of the time. another warnning if you planned on playing any hybrid characters, like a battlemage, expect to be behind in eveyrthign from health to damage to utility forever, or untill you use a magical deivce which lets you respect your character as many times as you like after the first act  edit: i dont think its a bad game, just not a game i can recomend, but id love to hear other peoples thoughts on what i said."

However the camera controls ruined this game for me. I don't normally complain about camera controls but I felt often that I was more trying to position the camera more than I was playing the actual game. The fighting with the camera made the large areas with massive detail more daunting than exciting and exploration felt like a hassle. Another issue I had was the detail and the lack of significant marking on characters. This could be because I'm visually impaired but because there is SO MUCH on your screen at once and so much folliage and trees everywhere I found it hard to find NPCs and even monsters let alone my own party members.  I'm not saying the game is bad per say but I can't personally reccomend it however lots of people seem to love it so maybe take your chance on it?

383,Blackadar,366,6,0,2017-09-21,Recommended,115.9,"Almost copy/paste of the original DoS2 review, this has been updated for the new edition.  I could just about copy and paste my D:OS review for D:OS 2. The short versions is that if you liked D:OS you'll like 2. If you didn't enjoy the first you won't like the second. So if you have experience with the first title, there's your answer. You can stop reading now. The rest of this review is aimed at those who haven't played the first game.  I thought the first was a GOTY contender in 2014 and I think #2 is a GOTY contender in 2017. But it's going to get tougher to keep recommeding this series when the same bugs and flaws keep showing up. So let's start with those flaws.  1. The obscure quests still remain from the original and you often have no idea how to move a quest forward or where to go next. The quest log is still quite useless. Some quests are quite obscure looking for objects that you may have uncovered (or not) including at least one with an object from a prior area. 2. Some screens are too much of a pixel hunt and the highlight button doesn't highlight most objects.  3. The difficulty curve is, frankly, stupid. Larian still needs to tone down the difficulty on lower difficulty levels and smooth the curve. You will likely hit problems in the low teens and then the endgame battles are stupid difficult. 4,. BUGS. Larian still can't test out bugs for?????? For instance, I finally won the final battle...only to have the game keep me in combat meaning I had to do the whole frickin' thing all over again. I finally got through it again and the voice-over proceeded to give me the wrong ending. DAMN IT LARIAN, YOU HAD ONE JOB!  Now on to the good stuff.  Like the first game, this game has the best turn-based combat ever to appear in a RPG. This is the meat of the game and it's sooooo tasty. There are many options on how to approach a battle, so many builds and so many tactics that it's impossible to even scrape the surface in a review. Literally no other RPG gives you this kind of build and combat flexibility.  Every encounter is a combat puzzle and most of them are fun. Sometimes an encounter seems impossible and then you figure out a strategy to make it relatively easy. This series remains the high-water mark of RPG combat and you could play it many times with many different builds because they play so differently. The AI is quite good to the point of being frustrating. You can - and will - get stun locked in certain battles (frustrating!). As I said, this is the core of the game.   The rest of the game is good too, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the combat excellence. The back stories of the starting characters are great and your party members seem to be far more developed this time. The voice acting has been consistently great and the music and sounds are still top-notch. The environments are quite beautiful and quite detailed though they are sometimes so busy the game delves into a pixel hunt. The races are really quite neat and there's a couple here that are fairly original which isn't easy to do in an RPG. The RPG aspects just feel more fully fleshed out in this version. The synergy between the NPCs doesn't seem to be very good to start but after a few rough bumps the first two levels it's easier to figure out how you want to blend your party. Truthfully, I haven't seen much in the Dev Cut that I didn't recall from the original but I'm sure there's some new stuff.  DoS2 is a step forward from the original and both are excellent games. Recommended for any RPG fan."

559,Kite,43,3,0,2017-09-21,Recommended,208,"Very addicting game. There are a lot of freedom in the game, the actions of the player will affect how other npcs act towards the player. Voiced dialogues with decriptive narration as if you are reading a book!   The combat is absolutely amazing especially for those of you that love using magic.  Whenever the player use a spell ie. Rain which will cause the area the leave puddles of water. The player can cast various spell on the water affected area for different status effect.  Casting aerotheurge skills on the water will cause electrocutions, casting poison will turn the water into pools of poison then use fire spells on the poison to release explosions!   There are so many ways of playing inside combat.  At first classic mode may be difficult for players that haven't got use to the game mechanics. One big tip is breaking enemies respective armor (physical/magic armor)  different enemies have different amount, some with lower physical and some with lower magical. Now then you'll have to carefully choose the right character to unleash damage on the enemy with physical or magical damage. Once the armor is broken you are free to put status effects on them to make them more vulnerable or simply crowd control them. Split your party before going in combat! And make uses of line of sight, make the enemy use ap on moving,   This game requires you to plan your strategy ahead, laying a spell and think of what that spell will affect for next few turn.   The world is stopping you from using your most powerful magic! But you hunger to unleash your full strength on to the world. Then this game is for you!"

I got into the early access and it felt very similar to the first, but more polished and the layout was more efficient.   The story is extremely in-depth, voice acting is exceptional with almost every npc having dialogue, a voice, and personality following suit.  The combat is great, targetting has been improved and what the reticle shows will happen is the actual result for the most part. Occasionally the abilities will miss, or you will accidentally move your character when you misclicked.   My only qualm is really the fact that I now have 6 friends who want to play with me, but we can't really get that together at once."

970,Liefwarrior,242,4,0,2017-09-21,Recommended,177.6,"Wow, where do I begin?  First off, Larian Studios is a company who respects the people who play their games.  Did you notice the price of the game?  Did you also notice that shiny Divine Edition with the awesome artwork and music?  I know that one thing I didn't notice was a bunch of content locked behind a paywall (Destiny has me jaded at this point).  DoS2 as a game respects the players more so than any game I've played since the good old Morrowind or Baldur's Gate days.  The way you explore this world they've crafted for you is completely up to you, because Larian Studios are a company who *respects* the way you want to play their game.  Any number of the bizarre scenarios you may find yourself in during the potentially 100+ hours of content can be reacted to with an equally large number of solutions.  You will get as much out of it as you invest into it, creativity will get you a long ways and will feel very rewarding.  The voice acting is wonderful, and every NPC in the game is fully voiced.  Even the narrator is voiced, the only lines that won't be read to you are the things you select to say for yourself (which is standard).  You really get the feeling that the NPCs have a life of their own and that the world is moving on with or without you.  The marks you leave on the world are very real, every monster/creature/villain/person you slay will never be back.  You may walk through the area much later and expect some battle with skeletons that you remembered from before, but this isn't Pokemon.  Once you kill something it never comes back.  Including you.   Perma-death is handled interestingly in DoS2, your character can die like any other, permanently.  It's got something akin to the D&D equivalent of resurrection with scrolls and spell you can buy from some vendors.  They won't be affordable for at least 10-20 hours into the game however, if you find yourself frequently dying in the first 10 hours of the game expect to empty your coffers on resurrection scrolls instead of that shiny sword you've been eying.  It works though, death SHOULD be punishing in a role-playing game, and this is just the right balance between death being too punishing and meaning nothing.    Combat always feels really good, and there's unlimited creativity you have when you're going about it.  The environment is entirely interactive.  Want to use a barrel as cover?  Sure.  Want to use telekinesis to move that barrel of oil towards your enemies and then set it on fire?  Sure.  Screw the barrel, I'll make it rain and freeze the ground and then combine my boots with nails in the crafting menu, now they're slipping all over the place but I can walk around like a champ.  Or sneak through the fight all together.  Or talk your way out.  There's so many ways to handle it.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game.  I've beaten it with about 65 hours but I was playing with no companions and with a Lone Wolf perk, there were SO many things I didn't see.  I've got 6 campaigns in progress and I'm still finding new stuff every day.  You'll thank yourself for getting this game."

1045,JimmyWolf,731,2,0,2017-09-21,Recommended,95.8,"I'm 20 hours in, playing with the same friend I played all the way through Divinity: Original Sin with.  We love that we're back in this world. It's beautiful, exceptionally well crafted and an exciting experience.  Combat is even more expansive than before, mixing the ideas that were so successful in the first game (use of elemental surfaces and spells) with new ideas such as the addition of an armour system for both magic and physical damage. This is something of a double edged sword though, on the one hand the armour system makes combat a really interesting dynamic of carefully choosing opponents based on whether their magic or physical armour is higher, what resistances they have and so on, but outside of the combat, the armour system makes traps completely devoid of threat as their effects will not breach your naturally regenerating armour. Whereas in the first game suddenly being hit by a fire trap would send on a quick jump to your hotbar to prepare a Rain spell or healing, now you just walk on without an issue.  We've deliberately avoided choosing the characters with origin stories as we're looking to focus on the main story and avoid the party dynamics that the game has. These characters can leave if they dislike the choices you make, which I fully support as a choice by Larian, but it's something to bear in mind when building your party at the start.   One thing that definitely amazes me is the full voice-acting. Thats a huge amount of work, especially as the Narrator is fully voiced as well. Well done to Larian, that must have taken an enormous amount of work, but it really adds to the world and to the immersion.  The only thing we miss is the music from the first game. Larian cannot be blamed for this, as the composer for the first game passed away but his music was exceptional and an extremely high bar to match. The music this time round feels too quiet pretty much all the time even at full volume and if we find a mod that adds the music from the first game we'll be grabbing that as soon as possible.  So far, 9/10, the only issues being the music and gameplay niggles that sometimes break an otherwise amazingly immersive experience"

There are few good game studios left out there, ones that really seem to love what they do and seem to be happy as long as they make money, not trying to squeeze every damn cent they can out of their fans, and more and more game studios seem to go this route, luckally we have some great studios that resist like CDPR and Larian, I try my best to not fall into brand loyalty and all that crap, but Larian really deserves it.  I would buy and try almost anything these guys make, because so far, they've earned it, please support them on their next adventure as well."

I've got to say that this game is one of the best for its price range, there's so much content in this game its crazy and its all voice acted :DD. Larian studio's really out did themselves with this game, if I had completed every single possible side quest/content before the main story finishes we are looking into 150hours plus (on honour mode which I play) or 100 hours plus on any other difficulty whilst reading dialogue etc.. This game is best played with friends as the character interactions/dialogue is top notch and provide really fun role playing. However I played by myself as I wanted to get immersed and finish the game on the hardest difficulty due feelings of it being rushed if I played with more people.   it took me 52 hours to complete the game doing story mission only with 1 origin character story (Lohse completed) as well as critical side quests that are blocking my way to the main quest. I'm also playing on Honour Mode difficulty(if your whole party dies you save is wiped), basically I have to play very safe ( I died quarter way in the game, salty af).   This game is worth every penny and its price tag just beats some of AAA games on global top sellers on steam for content/replayability to price ratio.

I agree with some reviews, that the combat is not easy, but honestly this is exactly what makes it fun... the combination of different elements, height differences, physics and the fact that even the simplest enemies have special skills etc. make each combat interesting.  No more grinding through simple skeletons with the same tactics each time! Heroes will die and you will have a hard time to ressurect them.

221,Amigo,142,14,2,2017-09-21,Not Recommended,81.6,"""I have a study to explore...""   If there's a single word to describe this game, that would be the word ""TEDIOUS"". I didn't like the first one. I thought it was overrated. I wanted to try this one partly because there were no new RPGs around. I wish I didn't. This game is the same chore as the first one. Playing this game for me is like grinding through many obstacles just to catch a glimpse of that old role playing feeling which this game certainly has.  The story. At it's core it's really similar to that of Baldur's Gate. Take Bhaalspawn and put Godwoken instead. You even start at a prison. Except the story in Baldur's Gate felt epic. In this game it doesn't. In Baldur's Gate 2 you had the prison, the huge city of Alkathla with it's several districts, de'Arnise Hold, Umar Hills, Trademeet, Spellhold, City of Caverns, The Underdark, Forest of Tethir Areas, Windspear Hills, Suldanessellar, The Nine Hells. What do you have in this game? I don't know really. 2-3 maps? Oh yeah, I forgot. You have a study to explore!  The voice acting. I have no idea why they made the decision to voice act every single dialogue line in this game. Was it really necessary? They wanted to impress people and boost sales? They had an excess of money to spend? This was not necessary. Like everyone in this game speaks such perfect English it's ridicuolus. Lizards speak like they are gentlemen from Westminster Abbey. Skeletons - the same. All characters sound similar. That's not what's called good voice acting. Like come on all you had to do was to add a little flavour to voice acting. Make lizards have their own manner of speech. The same for skeletons and elves. Probably dwarves too. Just voice act one line of dialogue but add flavour to it and make it count. In this game everyone sounds as generic as they can. I still remember the voice acting of one character from Baldur's Gate 2 - Tortured One, in a prison. Or Minsc. Was he fully voice acted? No, but he was so alive and had a tremendously distinctive character. With vocie acting in this game all characters can transform into a single word blob.  The pacing. It's extremely slow. Fights take forever to finish. Characters move like they are premanenlty overburdened. Every turn of the road on the map has containers/enemies/NPCs. It is the core design. To create less and to make it feel like it's a lot. Even that ghost vision. Man, it's such cheap trick. Press a button and you'll get another bunch of characters to interact with in the same places you've already been. ""But, I have a study to explore!"", you say. Indeed you do.  The gear. Gear in this game? Honeslty I felt like I was playing an MMO. Who gives a sheet? You find a so called ""legendary"" item in a chest, equip it. And then you find a blue item which is better in a chest next to it. It's just swapping gear with higher stats, that's what it is. There's no excitement in finding a new good item because you know that soon you will find a new one, a better one.  Progression system. We all know RPGs are about getting your character to new heights, learning new powers, abilities, etc. The important thing for developers is to make a player feel powerful as he progresses and develops his character. Yes, this game has a ton of abilities and powers. Yes, you do progress and get new ones. The issue is you don't feel powerful. There's always a group of mobs with higher level than you ready to make a meat stew out of you. Every fight is a tedious struggle with enemy at advantage. It makes all your glorious efforts feel a bit useless.  I could go on pointing out other weak spots of tediousness in this game. Like inventory system (oh my God, it's awful!), companion management, UI in general, crafting (what crafting? wait, there's crafting in this game?) etc. But it all comes down to this. If you are a masochist hungry for a new RPG and not afraid of grinding your way through inconviniences with a snale's pace, be my guest - buy this game, play it, explore a new study. Otherwise - AVOID, save your time. Wait for other RPGs."

Hasn't disappoint on the dialogue front so far but ... I cant say much more than that.  I started playing on Classic, the 2nd lowest difficulty, my success rate in battle has been about 30%. Maybe this is old hat for veterans of the genre but as a newcomer this has been absolutely brutal. There is little to no introduction to the combat mechanics - it has really made me appreciate the handholding most AAA developers like Blizzard and Square Enix provide.  Maybe I will give the game another shot in a few months - too late for a refund anyway.  Recommended if you have experience with the genre.

I wanted to make a melee character, but it seems like EVERY ability in the game causes an AoE effect, inevitably hitting your party members involved in melee combat.  Even the fighter's abilities are nearly all area of effects, unless you're simply autoattacking (and what fun is that?).  I'm sure tons of people will love it, and it is gorgeous, but I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone that wants to play melee characters."
832,LDiCesare,48,6,1,2017-09-21,Not Recommended,37.7,"I try to like the game but cannot. The game has a user interface which is extremely bad. They patched the inventory recently but it remains a PITA to use. Hardly anything about the UI is explained in-game. Even the fact you can get skills at later levels is something you'll have to guess or look up the internet before playing, otherwise you make choices without having nay idea what they entail. The difficulty is set in such a way that you more or less have to do everything in a certain order. If you skip stuff, you'll be too low level to beat that important enemy so I don't feel the freedom I would expect from this title. Combat is very boring imo. Most of your abilities are unusable until you have depleted your enemy of their armor, at which point you're better finishing them off, so all your control abilities are next to useless. The system also encourages each and every of your characters to be spread between physical and magical. Should you specialise a character, you'll be penalised for it. Finally, the graphics get tiring very quickly. Every battle has pools of liquid with lightning all over them, burning fire all over, or ice. It makes magic feel not magical at all, and it's just ugly and hard on the eyes in the end. "

Love the character creation with 8 races (so welcome; love multiple non-human racial choices in RPGs) and so many classes (that can be customized).   You can create one character and then you recruit NPCs along the way. There is a trick to create them all yourself though. See the Steam guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769494798 The NPCs are well done; there are 6 to choose from. Note when they join you get to choose their class (which is a great, original idea) but their race is fixed. Later on, you can respec all of their ability/talent/skill point selections if you want.  Items, equipment and enemies all seem quite interesting with lots of different stats and abilities. Controller(PS4,XBox) support is fantastic and it is fully playable via controller.

This is one of the best of them. Great setting, different enough to be interesting, but not too strange ... you can identify with story and characters ... oh, yes, interesting characters, too. Combat makes great use of abilities and environment. It can be tough but that's part of the fun for me. I think also that it might have a lot of replayability because you can choose a number of different Origin characters who seem to get slightly different story arcs.  Story ... for my taste way better than Original Sin 1 (same goes for most quests). Can't wait to learn more.  Voice acting (Larian originally did not plan to do it) is a great addition and adds a lot to the game. I backed this game on Kickstarter, it was a no-brainer because Larian did great work with Original Sin 1 and is simply a great company, very much in touch with their fans and customers.  Great company, gem of a game and to top it of: an editor.

136,JayRob,503,20,1,2017-09-22,Not Recommended,41.2,"Beware hyperbole.  ""Best game ever"" this is not.   Story is pretty interesting, and the first act of the game is fun.    The combat overall is pretty poorly balanced.  The armor mechanic, while seeming interesting at first, really hurts the balance later in the game.  Crowd control is basically neutralized, as you can't apply any status effect while a character's armor is still up.  There are certain battles which require you to protect certain NPCs under a time limit.  The enemy will all tunnel vision on the one NPC you're supposed to protect, in some cases this is 6+ enemy combatants.  You can't possibly outdamage that many enemies so normally your strategy would be to use crowd control to delay them until the time limit is up.  However, due to the armor system, this requires you to essentially outdamage 6+ enemies AND apply crowd control to them BEFORE they can kill your VIP.  This is simply impossible, especially with a 2-man Lone Wolf group.  The issue here seems to be a lack of playtesting all the various options that are available to the player.  Many power combinations are too powerful and others are not competitive.  Look no further than the infinite damage loop bug that the developers almost kept in the game because it was ""creative"".  The higher difficulties just exacerbate these issues even more.  The combat overall just lacks nuance, it doesn't feel tactical, mainly due to a lack of defensive options i.e. ways to negate or deter enemy actions.  This is putting aside all the combat bugs which are incredibly frustrating, such as Attacks of Opportunity not triggering and your character's turn being skipped for no reason.  This is all very sad after hearing laughable claims like ""More strategic than XCOM.""  I've put about 40 hours (half of that being pre-release) in the game on the higher difficulties before I couldn't stand the poor combat any longer.  I may start over on explorer simply to experience the story, which was quite good in my playtime.  I will give big kudos to the developer for adding full voice-overs, as it enhances the immersion and engagement of the story ten-fold.  Maybe I've gotten my money's worth already, but I am overall feeling disappointed, and I expected a lot more.  Wait for the inevitable Enhanced Edition I guess?  P.S.  For goodness sake, make your story achievements hidden."

I absolutely love this game and plan to play it again with different characters.   So why am I giving it a down? Well the first three quarters of the game are phenomenal. Act 2 specifically has some of the best side quests, world building, and characters of any game I have ever played. However the last act craps all over that. It switches from turn based rpg to more of a full on puzzle game, it is absolutely littered with generic npcs unlike the other areas, and all the fights go from tactical well thought out battles to games of ""find the gimmick that will help you cheese this fight""  On top of that they built up a phenomenal story with fantastic characters only for the ending to be incredibly bland and generic.  You will still get a really enjoyable 70 hours or so even if you find the last act as unenjoyable as I did.

I'm going to give this a negative review until some of them get solved.  - It's too hard to keep track of ongoing Quests. During exploration, I would encountered some Quest specific Events, without knowing that I did. Leading me to do things that I should not have done, result in the quest became close and unsolvable. Displaying a warning beforehand could really help. I know that it's Player driven narrative, but I prefer to have my quests solved.  - Shovel in Fort Joy. Even if there was a hint, I couldn't find it. And I didn't want to bring the Dragons along just to dig things.  - Trial & Errors Dialog result There was really little hints in the dialog that could show how the result will end up, making me do Save&Load again&again just so that I can clear those quests. In this kind of game, the results can be swayed by the traits of your characters. Thus, how the Players develop their characters became a fun part of it. But in this game, additional choices from traits do not guaranteed benefits. As such, I do not feel that traits are fun to play with. Please reference Shadow Run on this.  - Map & Key Object Display It took me too much time just to clear Fort Joy, with more than half the time spending on finding that exact thing to do in order to progress. I went pass both the drawbridge lever and the fort tunnel, because I didn't realize they are there. And then end up slaughtered the entire Fort before I could progress on.  - Bug - Not everyone in the party Entered Combat If a Party Member entered combat or flee, please teleport everyone in,  instead of having to make me select and manually move them one by one.  - Bug - Party Members don't follow Player This occurred sometimes. Party Members will just stand still and didn't follow. Coupled with the above bug really ruined it."
576,Huggles `,254,5,1,2017-09-22,Not Recommended,149.2,"Kind of a mess really, Full of charm and love, but now the gameplay is as ?????? as the story was in D:OS1 The combat system has become really bad from the days of good old D:OS1 Classic.  The new combat design philosophy is: ""every combat encounter must have screen-wide poison cloud explosions alternating with screen wide smoke on turn 1 and every turn thereafter. All enemies must constantly cast environment-effect spells (even turtles, alligators and dogs)"" Also, in tactical mode (the non cheesyeasy mode) instead of initative order turns, you now have alternating turns with the enemy group, which I think was set so exactly because of the new combat mess system.  It's a chaotic mess which looks awful and feels broken. Can't find the fun of it.   Can't really recommend."

If you were looking for a game that matched the original (when it was more of an RTS style), than this is NOT the game you are looking for.  I am very dissapointed in Larian Studios efforts here, they really just mailed it in, and are trying for a quick cash crab.  Maybe they were influenced by SEGA or EA or something, but it's really saddening to see such a beautiful game and honestly game culture get knocked down a peg.

12,Dracknov,153,518,7,2017-09-23,Recommended,271.9,"I was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill. I was tired of games that say it's 60 dollars, only to have randomized loot boxes or micro-transaction implemented later in time. I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddle.   Then Divinity Original Sin 2 came out. Each encounter is well executed and designed flawlessly. Enemy design  is varied and leaves my friend and I saying ""WTF is that!?"" often. Every time my friend finds some epic loot, we cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item. Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that's filled with important decision making. Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision. For $44.99 you are not buying a game but an experience. An experience to truly go on an epic adventure. Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple times, you are left leaving for more glory. (Currently playing on Tactician Mode)   I am not sure if anyone is going to read this review since this is my very first review with a positive rating (My other review is for Fallout 4 CREATION CLUB so you already know what rating I gave) but if you are looking for a game with challenge, depth, and quality give this game a try.

I'm willing to say I liked this even more than Pillars of Eternity, and I'm a Infinity Engine RPG nut.  It's a bit different than your classic CRPG, the main story doesn't seem that extraordinary, but it grows on you. It's not what makes the game good. The journey is.  - You have multiple ways to achieve things. Want to steal a chest without being seen? Teleport it away from affar. Want to blow up a door but it has too much HP? Blow it up with an explosive barrel.  Want to escape a keep of evil clerics? Well I'll let you figure that one out for yourself, you'll have many ways to chose from. - The voice acting is great considering how little budget they had compared to triple A companies. - Every NPC has something to say.  - The writting is just right, and very immersive. - Remember the combat in Torment:Tides of Numenera? Wipe that nightmare out of your memory with the combat in this game. It's fun, complex and actually makes  you look forward to battles. - Each companion is unique and complex. Great char development as well as you proggress.  I could go on for ages. The bottom line is they have outdone themselves immensly with this game.  Go buy it and support Larian so they can make more.

211,Ghost of Bukowski,"1,052",132,95,2017-09-23,Recommended,152.7,"The Game That Kept Me From Quitting Gaming AltogetherDAMN, I was tired. Beaten and broken to my absolute core. Like Gandalf after the Balrog fight, I lay like roadkill on Gamings Last Stand. Left in the ditch by the ravenous, greedy games industry, all but forcing me to violently amputate myself from my hobby after so many years, my thoughts returned to me through the mist of my mind. Game publishers had made me hate gaming more and more with every Microtransaction, Gambling Lootbox, and bergreedy DLC-pettiness, rubbing their scummy hands together, waiting for their chance to turn me so desperate that I'd sell my mum's wheelchair just to be able to play the story of a single player game wholesale instead of in disgusting piece-meal chunks.  Exhausted. Ready to let my hobby die.  Clearing my head to drift forever into the mindless, mainstream, middle-aged hobbies of pathetic Rom-Coms so bad they have to tell you where to laugh, sports night with a team letting you down for 20 years straight, and pedantic tv-gameshow hosts as full of themselves as the CEOs and board members of todays AAA game companies.  I had cried out for Mr. Newell, but he was nowhere to be seen. I called out for him again and again, desperately trying to summon the one time so great mythical Valve Overlord to give me a glimpse of Half-Life 3 or some other new IP, for a last incongruent attempt to restore my faith in The Greatest Hobby ever known. But Mr. Newell had sojourned to the evil gates of DOTA 2 many moons ago, and had never been seen since. Every Valve knave had followed their once and future king, but in their wake had only left silence for those few of us who still cared. Their footprints, all leading to DOTA 2, and not one leading back, had all but vanished.  And amidst the Consumer Forest behind Valve Village, there was talk of another presence, only whispered in fear, between creeping darkness and depressive thoughts; Artifact... Artifact... The wind carried the promise of a terrible omen, of yet another unnecessary card game to come, assuring the deliverance of the final strike into the once golden, now charred, heart of gaming. And Mr. Newell never appeared in this, my darkest hour. The heroic saviour was lost to time and space as he had succumbed to The Void of Game Industry Indifference.  My mind wandered. Valve Village lay in ruins. Long was the time since anyone had fixed anything on the barricades of Team Fortress, and the walls of Counter-Life: Grognard Operations' padded cells had crumbled, leaving demons and hell-outcasts running rampant and harassing any remaining villagers. There were rumors that some of the worst of these creatures had even snuck after Gabe through the gates of DOTA, in the Unholiest of Unholy joinings of good and evil, but none had heard back from them either. The Portals to the temple of Half-Life were rusted to a sad metal heap, and the temple they guarded had lied dormant for centuries with no Programmer Priests or Artist Acolytes left to work on the Half-Life religion. Valve Village was a ghost town. Dying at last, together with me.  I felt my body getting numb. I knew I was close to exhaling my last breath of gaming. Doomed to never experience the warm freedom from pathetic corporate game publisher mind tricks. Never allowed again to experience the sheer joy of a great game not tormented by CEO and board member greed.  I closed my eyes.  I made my peace with everything. Accepting of Bobby Koticks miniscule loaf-member, mercilessly drilling down the insides of my throat and demolishing my gag reflex for all time. No more protesting Zenimax and Bethesdas Pete Hines lying and lying, his nose getting longer and longer inbetween my butt cheeks as he denounced the fact that their new paid mods system is indeed paid mods. I let out a poor sigh as I came to terms with EAs horror show, drowning me and their other customers in blank-white secrete of filthy business decisions, in amounts so vast they could shave their chiseled, unethical game publisher jawline in the mirroring reflection of my soaked forehead.  Nothing mattered anymore. We, the customers, had lost. And as a single tear ran down my cheek, gaming was dead and gone forever. I embraced the darkness and muttered a final prayer to the gaming gods of old, before feeling a last remaining speckle of life vanish from my veins. My gamer soul was ready. I was to return home to 8bit, 16bit, Playstation and PC; to the 80s and 90s gaming heaven. Far away from the grotesque demonic onslaught hell here, far from the karmic injustice of game publishers burning the industry down until they had extinguished its last pittance of grace. I was ready. And darkness came.  Then, movement.  Not from me. Outside of me.  A feather of light touched my eyes. A vague, finely tuned iota beam, shimmering onto my eyelids. It tormented my weak sight, "

650,zanos,300,3,0,2017-09-23,Recommended,102,"Wow, where do I begin...  This game harkens back to a time long past, a time of unforgiving games that don't hold your hand,  and offers you pithy clues to make your way through a vast uncompromising land replete with challenging combat, the odd puzzle, and a myriad of ways to deal with a situation rather than selecting an option through a chat box.   There were so many instances during my playthrough where I felt like I was breaking quests only to see them to completion in ways that would have involved a reload in others.  It's a game that stands on some firm philosophical foundations: questioning the nature of power, the idea of power corrupting or the good that can be done if consolidated. It explores the nature of institutions in a world gone awry, exemplifying the idea that the road to hell is most certainly paved with good intentions. The moral dilemmas are many, and in an almost Witcheresque fashion, the consequences of actions taken often come with a cost.  That being said, Larian is able to balance the seriousness of the subject with the humor, sarcasm, and satire that they are known for and given the gravity of the events unfolding, the humor adds an extra dimension to the game.  The combat is as challenging as you want it to be. I don't mean in terms of a difficulty slider, I mean in terms of scouring the forums for optimal builds or cheesing for gold to get the best possible equipment. I don't condemn either, I found it rather refreshing that the satisfaction of combat is as customizable as you want it to be depending on how one chooses to engage in a situation. Do you use environmental barrels? Reposition before engaging the situation? Run in and make do? Some of these will work, others will not, but what is interesting is that the solutions to these situations are many and are at the discretion of the player.  The companions you can choose all have excellent backgrounds, some more interesting than others, but all of them were noteworthy. What is also interesting about it is that they are not just there for you, like in most RPGs, they have their own ambitions, goals, and desires and often time going at odds with them could cost you a slot on your roster.   The quests and the world itself are amazing, especially the latter. It's not perfect, and you can clearly see some additional attention was given to certain areas of the game over others, but the different areas, the choices made, and consequences really strengthen the overall story and your journey from a prisoner in Fort Joy to its aftermath.   The quests, in typical Larian fashion, run the gamut. They vary from discovering a serial killer to the occasional rescue to providing an item or eliminating a threat. They are pretty standard fare, but what is interesting is how many different ways you can handle them and the consequences of handling them in the way that you do. There have been bugs with journal entries, and sometimes quests can seem rather baffling, but I didn't really let that upset me. I have no doubt that in the coming months they will be fixed and tightened up. But yeah, to some, and to me at times, it was frustrating.  All in all, this was an excellent game. Perhaps that isn't the right word, it was better than excellent. It was not without its faults, but I really got a lot out of it, from the story, to the challenging combat, the voice acting, the perks and quirks of communing with animals, the different ways to tackle each situation and even the soundtrack. It's a tightly knit rich and rewarding game that you savor long after it ends and even into the beginning of the next playthrough.    If you like CRPGs, you will most likely really see this as a worthy successor to the Fallout 2 style of CRPGs. People have been comparing it to Baldur's Gate 2, and, in terms of the story, companions, and the epic nature of the experience, you can definitely draw comparisons, but the combat is firmly rooted in the Fallout 2 or Temple of Elemental Evil tradition.  So, yeah, Larian does it again, even better than before. I expected a good game, even a great game, but I was not expecting this. It will be penned into the great book of RPG goodness that it deserves. Larian firmly deserves every bit of success they get from this title.   They have stolen the divinity from the former greats and it is perhaps only contested for the crown, in my opinion, by CDPR. Obsidian is also up there, but POE, even in all of its greatness, failed to evoke the same feelings that I had for this. It really filled the void left for me by the Witcher 3, and for those of you that know what I'm talking about and perhaps for those of you reading these reviews to see if it's a worthwhile purchase...it is.  Good luck in your future endeavors Larian, I, for one, will be there to continue to back your projects henceforth, bien fait."

1979,Wololo,51,2,1,2017-09-23,Recommended,683.6,"Prior to Original Sin (the first one) i was not into ""old-school"" RPGs at all and the turn based combat really did seem like it could get boring, but as soon as i began playing i totally fell in love with the series and the gameplay, the Turn-Based combat really allows for great strategic depth and especially in Original Sins 2 it does not feel to slow/boring at all. Also most of the improvements to core gameplay mechanics made since the Original really make the game look overall more polished and challenging. I can therefore really recommend this game to everyone who is into RPG-type games or tactical combat as these surely are its strengths, Be aware though that the higher difficultys (e.g. Tactician) especially require you to really use the game's systems such as crafting to get through resonably easy, that said the game certainly will make you die a few times anyway."
89,vegan meth,329,18,0,2017-09-23,Not Recommended,103.5,"This is the best concept for an RPG ever made in my opinion. However I can not recommend it due to it being largely unfinished. It follows the same trend of Tyrrany in that the beginning of the game is vast and interesting, but once you get to the final acts everything falls apart. Constantly being forced to reload the game due to conversations bugging out, quests bugging out, combat turns bugging out, and pretty much anything else you can imagine just not working at all completely ruins the great writing and amazing gameplay mechanics. Have a character with high persuasion? Oh that is your main character? Too bad. Random peons in your group will constantly be addressed for major dialogue options, forcing you to fail the conversation, and either reload the game or just be forced to kill all of the npcs. There was even a time during one of the hardest fights in the game where I won the fight with 200 hp remaining on my final living character after an hour long fight, just to have the game bug out and prevent any further action. An hour long epic battle reduced to pointlessness. You can expect this to happen constantly. This game is worth $20 max. It isn't a very impressive display of modern technology either, so there is no reason not to wait for it to go on sale."
359,C Swords,189,6,1,2017-09-23,Not Recommended,15.4,"Let me start with this game is beautiful with some amazing music and a great story. There are many things about this game I do love, and I think the developers have done a fantastic job on the it.   I however cannot give it a thumbs up for a few reasons though, and can I add that this review is purely subjective to me.   Firstly, and mainly, this isn't the type of game you can stick on and play without reserving time out of your day. You need to spend actual effort into playing it, and what I mean by that is that the game gives you vague clues on where you need to go and what you need to do. Most quests are cryptic puzzles you need to solve by yourself. I currently do not have time in my life to put on my Sherlock hat due to having a 2 year old who takes my day up, and on a night I like to play something that I can play spending only 50% of brain power on. Now this you could argue that I am clearly not intelligent enough to play the game, and to that I wouldn't argue with you.  The game is advertised that decisions you make effect all aspects of the game. Well, I dispute this fact in it's entirety. When you are in the prison island, there is a local gangster who aparently controls food supply and has thugs etc. Well, I killed him. Not a single thing changed from this, the only thing I noticed was that I couldn't trade with him or his dead corpse anymore. Now once again, you can argue with this fact, as if you look at it closely, the gameplay was infact altered forever as I have lost access to a trader. If that is the case, then bah! He only sold a couple items that to me were of no use, and this is a trivial change to the game.  Source points, oh source points. I would have assumed that once I lost the collar, I would have been able to naturally cast spells. Nope, you have to find these source points, and once you have some, they are one time use. They do not regen over time and that was not what I was expecting. Now this complaint I can understand is only something that could bother me, but after all the effort I went through to find some, I would have hoped for them to be more useful.  With regards to skill points/character points etc, you do get plenty, that's not an issue, the issue I have is not knowing what would be useful. For instance, there is a crypt, the same place I found my first source points, and in there, there are some tombstones you can move. The thing is you need a character with a higher strength level than what you start with. This all sounds logical so far, but here is the issue. The game doesn't tell you that you need strength to open it, you have to make the assumption yourself, and even when you do, it gives no clue on how many points in strength you do need for it. Now I could have missed something here, but given my 50% brain allocation, I couldn't see anything that suggests otherwise.  That is my essay review on Divinity OS2, and why for me it isn't a breath taking game. It is in many ways fantastic, brilliant and genius, but in many other ways, for me, and yes that's a personal opinion, this isn't the best."

659,Jambers,169,8,2,2017-09-23,Not Recommended,1.5,90% of the the game is walking around reading poorly written NPC dialogue and searching the crates.

660,nerform,94,5,1,2017-09-23,Not Recommended,1.6,"I have 90 minutes on record. All of this time is spend in the game menu.  Yesterday me and 3 friend wanted to play this on local co-op (4 joysticks, one screen). First 60 minutes we ware trying to setup profiles and pick them with the 4 xbox 360 controllers. This is not really the game fault (maybe because other 4 player games are working just fine). I was using Nvidia Shield TV to stream the game to my living room TV. All 4 joysticks ware able to navigate the menus but they all are recognized as one joystick. So no way to pick the four different profiles. It took a while but I tested this by connecting the joysticks directly to the PC and removing the Shield TV. From this point I was able to pick the profiles.  On the character creation screen all 4 players were shown on top of each other (including the right side menus). No way you can configure anything. We tried to just go with what was selected by default (so we can at least see the actual game). You need to press the start button on each controller. Unfortunately one of the controller was not able to do that for some reason. I was able to see that he can rotate the camera and sound effects ware there but he couldn't press start.  At this point we just gave up. Plugged the joysticks back to the shield TV and played some 4 coop Broforce (no problems at all).  I'm refunding the game now. Even that this looks as dream come true game I won't play it because of game menu bug. Cheers devs."

So far, I feel like I'm forcing myself to play just to get my money's worth. None of the story has been very interesting, and the combat is slow and painful. You spent most of the time waiting for enemies to finish attacking than actually playing the game. Also, the ressurection system is ????ing ????????. Used all your resurrection scrolls? You're ????ed. There isn't any way to revive dead party members. Main character dead, no scrolls, no traders in sight? You've got to reload and redo that boss without dying. Tough luck.  Do not waste your money."
823,Europa,211,6,4,2017-09-23,Not Recommended,3.4,"The game isn't intuitive. You click on an open book on a pedastal in the very first area in the game to try to read it because maybe there's information or lore or something on it and you end up stealing it instead and then proceed to die to the guard or whatever in that room because you stole a book. No prompts to ask you if you actually wanna do an action, no instruction that you probably shouldn't be clicking on things unless you plan to die, and apparently there's a sneak mode too which they only tell you about after you steal something. At least in DND you get to say ""I steal the book off the pedastal!"" I mean even RuneScape has a pop up menu so you can choose what you wanna do.  In response to someone telling me to right click:  I mean, left clicking being steal by default is stupid. I figured out right clicking it works now so I can actually read it but after going into the next area I died again because apparently even if you sneak properly and steal something without anyone noticing it leaves a ""crime scene"" behind that basically means they'll just say you look like a thief then kill you. And of course the game only tells you that AFTER you steal something.  Not only that but the game keeps breaking. It broke multiple times in character creation so I had to restart over and over and then in a battle against the person I stole from the game broke again. It was the enemy's turn and they were just walking around me then returned to positions a bit away from me but still battle ready then sat there until I closed the game.  The chat system is garbage too. you have to hit enter to open it, enter to send the message, and enter to close it. The whole game is really unintutive. If you go to click on the chat and you accidentally click slightly off the window you end up moving there and that includes through a door into a bunch more guards and in consumes all your action points so you're guaranteed screwed just because of how unintuitive the game is.  Horribly programmed game. Terribly unintuitive in everything.  UPDATE: I tried stealing the item again(without having to read the tool tip this time). I even went ahead and hid the item somewhere else then when I came back since there was a crime scene the girl wanted to search me so I allowed it. After allowing the search and her finding nothing she basically just says ""well you still look suspicious so I'm gonna kill you."" Like... what? So basically you can do everything perfectly in this game and people will still kill you for no reason. I mean why don't they just kill the other guards too then and everyone on the ship? Still a terrible game.  UPDATE: So I tried playing through the game without stealing things and upon getting to Magistar Williams just a few rooms over after the whole thing there I tried talking to someone and it won't let me choose options any more. The game broke again. This game just seems to break constantly."

Try and get through most of the prologue if you can and if you don't hate the combat system then there's something wrong with you, but at least you can have fun with your purchase.  As for the story I haven't gotten through any because it's just boring. The amount of hard walls I've hit are utterly depressing. The forced NPCs you get to control are completely cookie cutter tropes forced into the game. Also you can't say no to these NPCs because then you lose any combat you get into!  Don't think that because people really enjoy this game that it's objectively awesome. Use your steam refund 2 hours wisely and make sure it's for you."

1144,Old Man Pizza Tony,124,2,0,2017-09-24,Recommended,127.4,"I have been playing this game since EA last year. Not religiously, mind you. But loading it up after just about every patch and playing Act 1 with my buddy. It has changed a lot since last December, and all of it for the better. I will mostly try to cover the changes since Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition, which I played through several times with a friend on Xbox One. I have not beat this game yet, and I probably won't for another 100+ hours. I am running multiple concurrent playthroughs with several friends and that takes an inordinate amount of time with how I play.  The tone of this game is not vastly different than the orignal, but it is different enough. No more vendors are yelling at you about cheese or entussling scrolls. The supporting cast is overall less goofy. You don't run into an obnoxious Goblin in the player housing and the new supporting cast is about 20x more interesting, despite the slightly more serious tone. The voice acting is stellar and a major surprise that it even happened at all, considering the vast amount of dialogue. Every character feels distinct and makes me want to talk to them. There are plenty of funny little dialogue throwbacks to weird little things that happened in the first game. From a talking skull in the very first area, a Dragon Commander character in Act 1, being scolded for looking for needles in haystacks, to references to Arhu in a random book 99% of players will never read. The narrator's voice is on point with inflection and appropriate humour for every dialogue option so far. I seriously cannot state how amazing the voice actors are in this game. There are just as many jokes and funny choices in this game as the first, neat sidequests, and funny names abound. They are just more in line with the slightly more serious tone of this game. The companions don't have absurd names like Bairdotr, but they are still colorful and interesting. They have their own goals and interact with the game world in very different ways.   Combat is infintely improved. High ground is decisive in victory, range combat is king, and making pure physical/magic builds is necessary for CC'ing high level enemies. No more RNG exists for crowd controlling enemies. It is based on depletable magical and physical armor. The armor values do not regenerate without special skills, but if you are making a solid build, there are ways to replenish this. The AI is smarter and know to avoid retribution builds, to target high DPS weak characters, and path around ground hazards. They pull neat tricks that only a player would have done in DoS:1. They set up combos turns in advance and enemy parties have really good synergy. Despite all this, the combat feels fair. They work within the confines of the game and the skills are very well explained. If you find your build is lackluster, that is fine, respeccing is free and readily available in Act 2. The build diversity is insane. Splashing for utility is extremely viable and necessary. Pure builds work in almost all encounters. I love the fact that everything but Rogue is usable. Memory is a huge cahnge, you can learn every single skill that your stats allow, but cannot put them on your bar unless you have enough memory slots to learn the skills. This does restrict how many spells you can use at once, but it is also balanced and the whole game is built around it. this is not a bad change, but it is a major one.  The biggest and best change is the removal of crafting as a skill. Anyone can utilize materials found without having to waste valuable points. Stealing art is still a valuable way to make money. I don't know how anyone could even play this game without a dedicated thief character. The game is not Skyrim, you simply cannot do everything in one playthrough. So many choices will fully lock you out of dialogue trees or quests. Not in a restrictive way, but in a lore-friendsly and realistic way.   If you want an RPG that has stellar combat, engaging dialogue, and love lots of reading, this game is for you. This game is not for everyone, and just because it wasn't made for you, does not mean this game is not a masterpiece."

I will mostly try to cover the changes since Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition, which I played through several times with a friend on Xbox One. I have not beat this game yet, and I probably won't for another 100+ hours. I am running multiple concurrent playthroughs with several friends and that takes an inordinate amount of time with how I play.  The tone of this game is not vastly different than the orignal, but it is different enough. No more vendors are yelling at you about cheese or entussling scrolls. The supporting cast is overall less goofy. You don't run into an obnoxious Goblin in the player housing and the new supporting cast is about 20x more interesting, despite the slightly more serious tone. The voice acting is stellar and a major surprise that it even happened at all, considering the vast amount of dialogue. Every character feels distinct and makes me want to talk to them. There are plenty of funny little dialogue throwbacks to weird little things that happened in the first game. From a talking skull in the very first area, a Dragon Commander character in Act 1, being scolded for looking for needles in haystacks, to references to Arhu in a random book 99% of players will never read. The narrator's voice is on point with inflection and appropriate humour for every dialogue option so far. I seriously cannot state how amazing the voice actors are in this game. There are just as many jokes and funny choices in this game as the first, neat sidequests, and funny names abound. They are just more in line with the slightly more serious tone of this game. The companions don't have absurd names like Bairdotr, but they are still colorful and interesting. They have their own goals and interact with the game world in very different ways.   Combat is infintely improved. High ground is decisive in victory, range combat is king, and making pure physical/magic builds is necessary for CC'ing high level enemies. No more RNG exists for crowd controlling enemies. It is based on depletable magical and physical armor. The armor values do not regenerate without special skills, but if you are making a solid build, there are ways to replenish this. The AI is smarter and know to avoid retribution builds, to target high DPS weak characters, and path around ground hazards. They pull neat tricks that only a player would have done in DoS:1. They set up combos turns in advance and enemy parties have really good synergy. Despite all this, the combat feels fair. They work within the confines of the game and the skills are very well explained. If you find your build is lackluster, that is fine, respeccing is free and readily available in Act 2. The build diversity is insane. Splashing for utility is extremely viable and necessary. Pure builds work in almost all encounters. I love the fact that everything but Rogue is usable. Memory is a huge cahnge, you can learn every single skill that your stats allow, but cannot put them on your bar unless you have enough memory slots to learn the skills. This does restrict how many spells you can use at once, but it is also balanced and the whole game is built around it. this is not a bad change, but it is a major one.  The biggest and best change is the removal of crafting as a skill. Anyone can utilize materials found without having to waste valuable points. Stealing art is still a valuable way to make money. I don't know how anyone could even play this game without a dedicated thief character. The game is not Skyrim, you simply cannot do everything in one playthrough. So many choices will fully lock you out of dialogue trees or quests. Not in a restrictive way, but in a lore-friendsly and realistic way.   If you want an RPG that has stellar combat, engaging dialogue, and love lots of reading, this game is for you. This game is not for everyone, and just because it wasn't made for you, does not mean this game is not a masterpiece."

As a bigtime fan of oldschool rpgs or especially crpgs, Im stunned by the sheer amount of work the devs put in it. After a long dark time without games that hold you for HOURS stuck on your chair, Im excited like a little kid.  +challenging, tactical turn based combat +loot! Feels special and it always nice to upgrade your peers. Really digging the additional skills you get from certain items +A story that keeps you interested +Great setting, the atmosphere is intense, so is the graphics +NO HANDHOLDING, if you ???? up, you ???? up. Especially at the beginning you will feel overwhelmed, but it has a nice progression/learning curve +Maps, markers, lore, books, its all there +Interesting companions throughout +Crafting is deep but simple, it also takes a little bit of work to get it going +The game lets you play and act like an oldschool pen and paper rpg. You are somewhat free how you overcome certain challenges (sneaking, plain combat, hidden entry, talking, persuasion.........) +Consequences of your choices +FULL VOICE ACTING. Everything is voice acted, from the narrator to every little npc you see. It gives a great sense of immersion.   -very difficult for new players to the genre, no handholding (which is a good thing imo) -the inventory is a clusterf**k. If you arent somewhat patient, you will hate it -quirky dialogue sometimes, this can be seen as positive or negative, Id appreciate a more serious tone, though, it keeps a good balance -colors too bright imo  Thats just the things on top of my head. For every rpg fan, especially oldschool pnp or crpgs fans or just people with a little bit of patience, you re in for a GREAT time. Getting back the feeling of playing nonstop without getting bored. Sleepless videogame nights are to come.   After finishing the first real act, I had to write a review, because they deserved the praise they get. Thats how you make games.

The game's only plus in my view is its insame difficulty in combat which in our times seems popular where some people think playing extremely difficult games requiring an insame amount of time makes them something special. I think it's ridiculous, it's annoying like hell.

247,Erbs,90,8,1,2017-09-24,Not Recommended,84,"This is the first time i have felt the need to write a review of a game due to the total mis-infomation out there.     There are many reviews of this game saying that this is the best thing since sliced bread or ""Game of the year 2017""....  Do NOT believe a word of it, this game is far from it. That's not to say that at the heart of it this is not a great game, but this game is not a finished product.    Let me do my best to expain what is wrong with a few examples, I will do my best not to give any spoilers...  First is that many reviewers are comparing this game to the likes of DA:Origins, which was one of the reasons I purchased it myself, well it's not even close...  A game from 2009 has this game licked in every possible way apart from the graphics are slightly better in this but a modded version of DA:orgins sorts that too.  Right from the get go this game gives you no info or any real expalanation to anything from character creation to 10 hours into the game.   The fact it has no hand holding by itself is not a problem and to many RPG fans including myself this didnt seem like a hurdle, i've been playing games for nearly 30 years I was sure i could work it all out. Well im about 15+ hours into the game (Steam seems to say less but meh...) and ive realised my Team/Group and my lead hero are just total failure.   See once you play the game for a while you suddenly realise that the combat in the game, although feels tatically correct, if your team is not full of ranged classes then you will get wiped out for the most part. The problem is with the way combat works in general, as in enviromental elements are so massively more important than what class you play or what you do with it.  E.g you can have a rogue with everything going for it but it will hit like a wet noodle and constantly die.  Now compare that to a ranged Mage/Ranger that can fire a fire spell to light up the enviroment and just kill everything including ""your"" Melle :) This then brings you squarely to the next issue and that is the AI that you will be fighting.... It's good..... Great you say... Well yes but every single mob from a simple beast to a named Elite runs with that great AI so you feel like your fighting the same mob with a differnet skin.   Now couple that with the fact that every mob from a dumb thug to a Top notch wizard is given loads of abilities... SO everyone and their mother can teleport/stun/cripple etc etc What this means is you will find yourself in just about every fight dealing with stupid amounts of CC and fire and eviromental effects everywhere melting your team.  Thus why i mentioned earlier that you will want to start using only ranged and cheese fights which makes you feel cheap. All this then means that for the most part you may lose one or two of your team so you will want to res those people... Well thats not that easy, unlike many other games where once combat has ended and you have won your fallen comrads will dust themselves off and you can heal up and move on......    Not here, you will need to use a Scroll of Resurection on each of your dead team mates which are very expensive and rare.   What this means is even if you manage to get through those tough combat areas you are still going to have to re-load a previous save because you lost someone to some cheap mechanic. Now i do appreciate there are going to be people reading this and thinking ...Wow this sounds great and i like difficult games..... This game is NOT difficult it is Frustrating ....those are two different things.   I have been playing this game on ""Normal"" and the difficulty is bang on, if i want it more difficult there are 2 higher difficulty settings.   However banging your head against a brick wall due to bad design/cheap mechanics/bugs is just pure frustrating.  Talking of bugs and other annoyances.... and there are plenty, way too many for me to list. Some are just niggles but some are just a royal pain.   These go from bugs while in combat of spells not firing off and instead your character walks off into fire or does something else unwanted.  All the way to serious bugs in quests not completing having to walk away and back again multiple times until the game triggers something, NPC's not responding to completed quests until you re-load or click on them multiple times. This actuall brings me to another problem which is dialogue in the game, it is handled on a ""Per"" character system so you can actually talk to the same NPC with all your team members, in theory this i a nice touch e.g NPC X won't talk to me because im Human but will talk to my Lizard friend.  The problem is like most things in this game which are good in ""theory"" the execution is poor and what you are left with is a conversation which you end up repeating 4 times just to see if anything is different.  This again would not be a problem if it felt right but what usually happens is you just have to repeat all the same conversation choices you just did not knowing if the NPC will register your first characters conversation or the last. Once again this brings me nicely on to my next complaint.... Dialogue choices ... theres loads and they all feel great when your clicking on them until you realise for the most part it doesnt make any difference and there is only one outcome to the convesation then that is whats going to happen...period.  There are multiple smaller problems like UI is poor, Inventory is badly handled and quest/journal tracking is bad at best, none of which by themselves is that bad but once you start grouping all this with many of its other bad parts you end up with a mess of a game.  Now please believe me when I say I write all this with a heavy heart because the game makes you ""Want"" to love it and you will try everything to like it but there comes a point when there is just too much wrong. The annoying part is if the Devs took this game and spent a couple of weeks ironing out the problems, removing some of the poor combat elements and fixed bugs etc then this game could be something special.... the potential is there.... just not now and for the price tag of ?30 .... hell NO.  However i do believe that maybe in 6 months time im sure the modding community will have this game where it needs to be and i can come back here and change my review.....  I hope..... "

Frequent crashes start occuring in act 2. They seem centered around specific abilities, which would still make it playable if it was only the player who used them, but when you're nearing the end of a long tough fight about to win and the last enemy decides to cast fire whip and crash you're game... Ugh. Not fun to leave victory in battles to RNJesus.  Overall, great game, beautfial graphics, fun story, amazing soundtrack, and the scenery is littered with attention to detail. Highly recommend this game, just wait a bit to buy until they work out the crashes. (Will update review once fixed)."

Some might scream ""TACTICAL DEPTH"" in defense of tactics such as using water to put out fire, then electrically charging the steam to create an electrified AoE cloud of death, but in practice all effort spent into building a character and utilitizing your actual character talents falls by the wayside in favor of manipulating god-damn puddles of elemental goop, and don't worry, you'll have elemental goop EVERYWHERE since almost every character worth playing, as well as all the NPCs have access to one or more skills that spread some sort of element on the ground, turning every battle into a massive ????ing mess on the floor."

1107,mysticalyale,128,No,0,2017-09-24,Not Recommended,212.3,"I love Divinity original sin. It allowed for freedom and interesting combinations.  The game had its own charm and the flaws in the system ,overpowered/ underpowered abilitys made it fun to play. The areas and creatures you encountered kinda made sense and you knew generally what to expect.  With that said the enhanced edition was released and the game took a turn for the worse becoming an overbalenced borefest.  This is where Divinity original sin 2 comes in. Just like the enhanced edtion it has great graphics, fun original content,etc etc...  but....its just not like the first. It lacks charm.  I will say straight away I have never  played a game more irritating than this one. The enemies are perfect. They are annoyingly perfect in even action they take. It's just silly. The enviroments are cleary fabricated to put you at the disadvantage. There has clearly been too much time put into making sure that you cannot do anything, but be at the disadvantage. Its maddening.  Things I HATE about this game.     1. Every enemy is everything and every ability is the same. What fun is it when fighting a zombie( in a tactical game) and you get out of range of the zombie( tactically) because, its a zombie and you don't want it close, just to end up getting hit with a ""zombie shot"" while the zombie carefully dodges the obstacles in its path, or you end up having him instantly next to you with a ""zombie teleport"" or even worse he runs over and punches his ally to heal his friend. That is not a zombie, why is every creature so tactical? Why even bother with graphics? Its deceptive and makes no sense. I have seen guys hit themselves to hurt my character, just because they knew it would give me some kind of status effect or kill me. I have seen enemies cast shackles of pain on my charactoer and as the last link to the chain formed they stabbed themselves in the heart. It utter rubbish and it is completely out of character. To add to that , every guy seems to have every ability with just a different name. Its boring, even melee characters can teleport around. At least make them look like they are jumping with their ability, not make it look like magic. I thought the characters on the board were supposed to be each special and different. That is why you have 4 characters right? what is this? Gauntlet? Can't hit them close with your axe so you throw axes? Boring. Rubbish.      2. Overpowered and broken status effects. Taking away people's turns and damaging them is a good way to create one way to do things. Why hit someone with a regular attack when you can take away their turn also. ""Hmm. I don't think I will get battle stomp, where I can hit multple people, destory elemental ground and take away turns, Im going to get something more my character like threaten....(I do have to admit I love watching my characters have threaten cast on them, apparently they are so taunted they do ineffective things to the enemy that taunted them, but also manage to do effective things to harm my team, while also using all of my items for no reason. Hmm.. I going to cast this weak fire spell instead of hitting you for 6k a pop... Rubbish) Dealing with staus effects using armor makes little sense. What is the point of battering ram if you can only use it after you have beaten people down? Isnt it a charge??? I mean they are already standing right next to you at this point! One of the most frusterating things about this game is that almost every fight I witness NPCs making choices simply because they A. They knew everything about my character (and they shoud not). (Glass cannon is a good example. They somehow just know you have glass cannon so they ALL target you for status effects. It is absolutely hair pulling annoying.) Or B. They knew the outcome to every possible choice. Either way this makes them very frusterating to fight. Not fun, frusterating. Games are supposed to be fun    3. Overbalenced. The game is so balenced it is boring.It reminds me of playing everquest and then moving over to play EQ 2.  It forces characters to be ""even"" (through loot, class abilites etc etc..) regardless of the choices you make. Don't believe me? Just look at the loot, its clearly designed for flat stat'ers. When was the last time you saw an armor peice designed for a melee character that had incredible characteristics that required a stacked stat such as strength? My warrior has many a point placed into stats that do nothing for me but make it so I can wear the awesome armor that requires intelligence or finesse.. Scale mail with bonuses to intelligence and various spellcasting bonuses, but requires strength to wear....Please point out a piece of armor and prove me wrong.    4. Every enviroment is everything and every enviroment is not your playpen it is their's. Having trouble with a fight? Run away. Make them come to you. If you can...What should be very clear when playing this game is that confrontations are not setup for you to have any advantage. Alot of time and thought has clearly been put into this. In the first game it seemed more of any ""everybodies playground"". In this game it seems that the enviroments were designed to make it more difficult for players, not as a playpen for everyone. We found it so annoying and difficult that my friend and I just engage fights without even talking to people as a general rule of thumb, because they will attack you anyway, after being jerks, then run away and it works well. (What is up with stat checks? I mean 40+ in a stat and you just lose. pfft.)  5. Throw away guys. I hate fighting enemies who are powerful threats to my survival, but when they are killed they seem to be just empty..... First off.. I want to see their character sheet. How did they, being the same level as me become a wizard who bests me in every stat, hp, armor, strength,  etc etc.. who clearly have items. Where are they? Where are all of their items? They must be pretty dang good to make them as powerful as they are. That is what risk and reward are all about. This game ultimately ends up being all just a risk on my part, with little to no payout. I think if there was one point I could drive home to all games it would be this. There has to be risk on both sides at the very least to confirm the realism of your opponent. You cannot roleplay when everyone is just a shadow of a person.  6. Special campiagn characters. I decided to make my own character and use Lohse and the red prince as my others. I spent time gearing them and leveling them up with the stats I wanted for MY TEAM. Only to have toward the end of the game them both leave the group via result of the story. What?!?! Really?? Why would you do that? I get the idea behind the story, but why would you set players up for failure? There is still team oriented game to be played left. Why would you do that? *Shrug* *laugh* Really?.... Now I get to hire some premade character I cannot adjust at this point of the game to fit the role of the character you took away for the storyline. Dont play the premade characters unless they are your main character.  7. Is there anyone on this game that is remotely likeable? I killed EVERYONE and would do it again and again.. so very unlikeable.  8. 85% is 85% to hit. Why does the game make it seem like its 5%?  Aside from all the ranting, it is fairly fun and well made, but it needs some serious tweaks done to it to give it some charm   Play this one only if you have played the first one to death"

The enviroments are cleary fabricated to put you at the disadvantage. There has clearly been too much time put into making sure that you cannot do anything, but be at the disadvantage. Its maddening.  Things I HATE about this game.     1. Every enemy is everything and every ability is the same. What fun is it when fighting a zombie( in a tactical game) and you get out of range of the zombie( tactically) because, its a zombie and you don't want it close, just to end up getting hit with a ""zombie shot"" while the zombie carefully dodges the obstacles in its path, or you end up having him instantly next to you with a ""zombie teleport"" or even worse he runs over and punches his ally to heal his friend. That is not a zombie, why is every creature so tactical? Why even bother with graphics? Its deceptive and makes no sense. I have seen guys hit themselves to hurt my character, just because they knew it would give me some kind of status effect or kill me. I have seen enemies cast shackles of pain on my charactoer and as the last link to the chain formed they stabbed themselves in the heart. It utter rubbish and it is completely out of character. To add to that , every guy seems to have every ability with just a different name. Its boring, even melee characters can teleport around. At least make them look like they are jumping with their ability, not make it look like magic. I thought the characters on the board were supposed to be each special and different. That is why you have 4 characters right? what is this? Gauntlet? Can't hit them close with your axe so you throw axes? Boring. Rubbish.      2. Overpowered and broken status effects. Taking away people's turns and damaging them is a good way to create one way to do things. Why hit someone with a regular attack when you can take away their turn also. ""Hmm. I don't think I will get battle stomp, where I can hit multple people, destory elemental ground and take away turns, Im going to get something more my character like threaten....(I do have to admit I love watching my characters have threaten cast on them, apparently they are so taunted they do ineffective things to the enemy that taunted them, but also manage to do effective things to harm my team, while also using all of my items for no reason. Hmm.. I going to cast this weak fire spell instead of hitting you for 6k a pop... Rubbish) Dealing with staus effects using armor makes little sense. What is the point of battering ram if you can only use it after you have beaten people down? Isnt it a charge??? I mean they are already standing right next to you at this point! One of the most frusterating things about this game is that almost every fight I witness NPCs making choices simply because they A. They knew everything about my character (and they shoud not). (Glass cannon is a good example. They somehow just know you have glass cannon so they ALL target you for status effects. It is absolutely hair pulling annoying.) Or B. They knew the outcome to every possible choice. Either way this makes them very frusterating to fight. Not fun, frusterating. Games are supposed to be fun    3. Overbalenced. The game is so balenced it is boring.It reminds me of playing everquest and then moving over to play EQ 2.  It forces characters to be ""even"" (through loot, class abilites etc etc..) regardless of the choices you make. Don't believe me? Just look at the loot, its clearly designed for flat stat'ers. When was the last time you saw an armor peice designed for a melee character that had incredible characteristics that required a stacked stat such as strength? My warrior has many a point placed into stats that do nothing for me but make it so I can wear the awesome armor that requires intelligence or finesse.. Scale mail with bonuses to intelligence and various spellcasting bonuses, but requires strength to wear....Please point out a piece of armor and prove me wrong.    4. Every enviroment is everything and every enviroment is not your playpen it is their's. Having trouble with a fight? Run away. Make them come to you. If you can...What should be very clear when playing this game is that confrontations are not setup for you to have any advantage. Alot of time and thought has clearly been put into this. In the first game it seemed more of any ""everybodies playground"". In this game it seems that the enviroments were designed to make it more difficult for players, not as a playpen for everyone. We found it so annoying and difficult that my friend and I just engage fights without even talking to people as a general rule of thumb, because they will attack you anyway, after being jerks, then run away and it works well. (What is up with stat checks? I mean 40+ in a stat and you just lose. pfft.)  5. Throw away guys. I hate fighting enemies who are powerful threats to my survival, but when they are killed they seem to be just empty..... First off.. I want to see their character sheet. How did they, being the same level as me become a wizard who bests me in every stat, hp, armor, strength,  etc etc.. who clearly have items. Where are they? Where are all of their items? They must be pretty dang good to make them as powerful as they are. That is what risk and reward are all about. This game ultimately ends up being all just a risk on my part, with little to no payout. I think if there was one point I could drive home to all games it would be this. There has to be risk on both sides at the very least to confirm the realism of your opponent. You cannot roleplay when everyone is just a shadow of a person.  6. Special campiagn characters. I decided to make my own character and use Lohse and the red prince as my others. I spent time gearing them and leveling them up with the stats I wanted for MY TEAM. Only to have toward the end of the game them both leave the group via result of the story. What?!?! Really?? Why would you do that? I get the idea behind the story, but why would you set players up for failure? There is still team oriented game to be played left. Why would you do that? *Shrug* *laugh* Really?.... Now I get to hire some premade character I cannot adjust at this point of the game to fit the role of the character you took away for the storyline. Dont play the premade characters unless they are your main character.  7. Is there anyone on this game that is remotely likeable? I killed EVERYONE and would do it again and again.. so very unlikeable.  8. 85% is 85% to hit. Why does the game make it seem like its 5%?  Aside from all the ranting, it is fairly fun and well made, but it needs some serious tweaks done to it to give it some charm   Play this one only if you have played the first one to death"

542,Jobbut,198,8,0,2017-09-25,Not Recommended,137,"[Spoiler-Free Review] Foreword: The game is not reccomended for a few major reasons: 1. It lacks serious mechanical polish; if you played the first game, expect to be disappointed by many of the mechanics. 2. The game is seriously bugged, the majority of quests are very likely to break and become uncompletable-- Including the entire endgame sequence. 3. Acts 3, 4, and the endgame lack the content and polish of the first two acts, and were clearly rushed out the door.  Pros (Reasons to Purchase) +Combat is turn-based, tactical fun +Game has very acceptable voice acting, no particularly bad examples stand out +Art direction and visual design is top notch +OST, while not as good as D:OS1, is not bad with many fantastic tracks +World is vibrant and full of characters you can interact with +Game allows you a great degree of freedom in exploration and progression +Memory Slot system is much better than D:OS1's School system +Early game is very polished and expansive, lots of content and choice   Notables (Things You Might Want To Know_ =The writing is very hit-or-miss, but is excellent compared to AAA RPGs =Combat is very easy to those familiar with cRPGs and played the first game to completion; but is very challenging for those inexperienced with tactical combat or cRPGs. =Potential party members seem very abrasive and offputting early on before their stories develop =As of the time of writing, support for content creators is barebones but growing  Cons (Reasons to Think Twice) -Game's Quest Log system is broken, almost every quest in the game can and will break, have wrong entries in the journal, become unresolvable, or just outright disappear -Game's combat is significantly streamlined -The new Armor System was not properly fleshed out, leading to a lot of issues -Several mechanics are redundant, forgotten, or outright removed (Accuracy, Initiative, Attributes, etc) -Itemization, Crafting and the Economy are much worse than the previous game's -Character Building is very boring compared to D:OS1; there isn't nearly as many elements to work with, and lots of choices have been streamlined away -Lategame gets more and more restrictive and unpolished, things become a trainwreck by Act 4 -Devs are on a spree of nerfing/removing/restricting things in the game rather than fixing balance or overhauling anything; does not set a good trend for the game's continued development and community support  If you really want to buy it, or liked the first game, just do a bit of research about what changed and the game's current state before you end up in a 4 man coop party 49 hours later unable to complete the game, and half of you end up quitting or refunding before they bother to release the first major patch a month later.

This game is a throwback to the glory days of crpgs like Baldurs Gate, Fallout and many more. Decisions matter, your party matters, everything you do matters. Not only that, but it also offers a rich world, where things happen around you wether you intervene or not. To top it off, the game looks great and has the best soundtrack and sound design I have ever heard.  On the other hand you have some minor continuity issues that can prop up if you take the open invitation of the game to play your own way to the extreme and some clunkyness with the UI. Nothing too major, those are things I can tolerate in a game that comes along fully voiced.  Comparing this title to other so called RPG's of modern times bar the Witcher series reveals a lot about the state of the industry. Larian gives the big names like Bethesda or Bioware a run for their money with this masterpiece.  In closing: My characters girlfriend, a demon-posessed bard that turned into a demon hunter once I helped her purge the demon from her soul played a heartfelt song (Yes, they recorded it) in front of the throne of the last living god. Can't recommend enough."

All the fights are so difficult that I have to save-scrub each of them multiple times; I can't imagine how hard playing this on the hardest difficulty is.  Super in-depth lore, lots of stuff to be engrossed inside. The world feels a lot like a less grim Path-of-Exile (you're sent to a prison island), which I like a lot.

1659,ninjannuity,253,2,0,2017-09-25,Recommended,97.1,"Did you ever love playing a tabletop RPG (DnD, DCC, MCC, etc) but the logistics of getting one together was hard? Look no further adventurer, for Divinity: Original Sin 2 creates a tabletop experience right from your 'battlestation'.   Naturally, the game is challenging and open, there are many options of how to play and what to do in any given scenario. Kill everybody! What the hell right, they're in  your  way after all right? Or, befriend as many people (monsters, creatures, and animals as well) as is possible! What the hell right, they're part of  your  adventure after all right? Dialogue is so well done in this game, so profoundly voice acted that most characters have a unique feel and attitude as well as conversation choices (often per Origin character, meaning the five Origin characters have unique interactions with the world).  Character creation is fluid, meaning, at a certain point in the game you have an opportunity to re-spec each character in your campaign into a better presentation of what you wanted in the game. For example, didn't like the summoner healer and instead wanted a summoner ranger? Well, why not! Or perhaps a jack of all trades? That is probably one of the more enriching experiences of the game, feeling as though one did not ???? up in terms of how they allotted skill points.  One of my favorite elements is the use of surface elements (blood & water, or either electrified, ice, fire, poison, oil, and cursed ground -- you'll see that for the first time and it is an intense experience especially on harder difficulties).  But beyond that, the playing with friends experience is open and ongoing. Say a friend can only hop in for a few hours on the weekend, while you've played 34 hours in 3 days? Well, they can jump into one of the characters you have, re-spec them to their liking, finish a couple quests and get out all while continuing along your level base and campaign. (and you can do the same to their campaign, should they ever make one)  PROS: - Great character development and voice acting - Awesome fluidity in how to build characters - Satisfying and intense turn-based combat (on Tactician it is hard, but not impossible) - Rewarding unique playstyles without catering too much to cheese (without giving it away, the game will sometimes know if you cheese certain puzzles) - Ongoing joining/leaving process for party play with friends - Brings visualization to the tabletop experience (imo, but still) - An absolutely enormous amount of content - Challenging and fun (or frustrating and befuddling) puzzles! - Connecting the dots on quests can be sometimes misleading, meaning the player needs to actually put in the work to logically figure out what the questbook/discovered dialogue related to the quest means in order to complete it -- this is not always straightforward and direct.  CONS: - There actually are some bugs, believe it or not, and because of that remember (REMEMBER!) to save OFTEN - Somewhat slow-paced (not a personal con, as tabletops are slow-paced, but I have heard this be a turn off so I include it) - Some quests are easy to miss or hard to figure out due to the last point on PROS, (not a personal con, but it is something that may frustrate people who aren't used to having the game hold their hand through exploration/decision making related to important quests)   tl;dr: great open RPG with turn-based combat akin to tabletop gaming, think outside the box and be rewarded, discover more about the characters and races and be rewarded (or disgusted). Combat is wonderful, albeit tricky, and full of dazzling experiences. Great for picking up and leaving off with friends who have busy or demanding schedules.  If you're a fan of turn-based RPGs then give this one a go on sale, or if you're a die-hard tabletop RPG person pick it up when you can. If you have friends you can convince to play this with you, do that, probably one of the best buddy-gaming experiences I have had in a great while."

The combat is difficult yet rewarding, the story engrossing, the freedom and choices to approach situations is impressive, the coop is done superbly well , and to top that off, every single line of dialogue is brilliantly voice acted. Thank you Larian for creating such wonderful games. I simply cannot wait to see what you guys come up with next - but until then, I will go back and get lost in the world of Rivellon."

1874,Moogie,171,2,0,2017-09-25,Recommended,97.9,"Loved the first game, despite its flaws. I feel like this game fixes every issue the first game had and across the board improves on it - my hat off to Larian Studios for listening to feedback.   While the story and setting is darker, there is so much humor sprinkled into this game. With the addition of voice acting, I find myself listening to everything. I didn't know how to feel about the narration at first, but it has grown on me and I feel like it's a great addition to the game. The Origin stories are a neat touch, I am doing my first playthrough as Lohse and I feel like mine is the most interesting of the group. Definitely want to try Fane next.  Overall, its a beautiful game with great little details hidden everywhere. (Also the music is great)  I have a hard time coming up with any real criticisms of the game, but I will try. I wish there was a better loot system - i play ranged and I just never get to loot anything, which isn't very fun. Some of the quests I've run into were bugged, so that's a bummer but I'm sure they'll be fixed in the near future and I can do them on my Tactician playthrough. I feel like playing with 4 people pulls the game into too many directions, I miss stuff that other people are doing and everyone wants to have the feeling of exploration - that's not really a game flaw, I just think it'd be a better experience with 1-2 players."

The music, gameplay, character development, the world itself, the permeatations and various choices you are actually allowed to make all come together with good voice acting to make a bloody brilliant game.

3,Jobbut,198,8,0,2017-09-25,Not Recommended,137,"[Spoiler-Free Review] Foreword: The game is not reccomended for a few major reasons: 1. It lacks serious mechanical polish; if you played the first game, expect to be disappointed by many of the mechanics. 2. The game is seriously bugged, the majority of quests are very likely to break and become uncompletable-- Including the entire endgame sequence. 3. Acts 3, 4, and the endgame lack the content and polish of the first two acts, and were clearly rushed out the door.  Pros (Reasons to Purchase) +Combat is turn-based, tactical fun +Game has very acceptable voice acting, no particularly bad examples stand out +Art direction and visual design is top notch +OST, while not as good as D:OS1, is not bad with many fantastic tracks +World is vibrant and full of characters you can interact with +Game allows you a great degree of freedom in exploration and progression +Memory Slot system is much better than D:OS1's School system +Early game is very polished and expansive, lots of content and choice   Notables (Things You Might Want To Know_ =The writing is very hit-or-miss, but is excellent compared to AAA RPGs =Combat is very easy to those familiar with cRPGs and played the first game to completion; but is very challenging for those inexperienced with tactical combat or cRPGs. =Potential party members seem very abrasive and offputting early on before their stories develop =As of the time of writing, support for content creators is barebones but growing  Cons (Reasons to Think Twice) -Game's Quest Log system is broken, almost every quest in the game can and will break, have wrong entries in the journal, become unresolvable, or just outright disappear -Game's combat is significantly streamlined -The new Armor System was not properly fleshed out, leading to a lot of issues -Several mechanics are redundant, forgotten, or outright removed (Accuracy, Initiative, Attributes, etc) -Itemization, Crafting and the Economy are much worse than the previous game's -Character Building is very boring compared to D:OS1; there isn't nearly as many elements to work with, and lots of choices have been streamlined away -Lategame gets more and more restrictive and unpolished, things become a trainwreck by Act 4 -Devs are on a spree of nerfing/removing/restricting things in the game rather than fixing balance or overhauling anything; does not set a good trend for the game's continued development and community support  If you really want to buy it, or liked the first game, just do a bit of research about what changed and the game's current state before you end up in a 4 man coop party 49 hours later unable to complete the game, and half of you end up quitting or refunding before they bother to release the first major patch a month later.

930,Netograt,2,3,2,2017-09-25,Not Recommended,52.7,"SCAM! This game has amazing online reviews that I can only assume after playing it are staged because it is not possible for so many people to have posted reviews that are inaccurate. This means there is serous catfishing involved, the people clicked on the worng game for the review or I'm not in my right mind. While the graphics are nice to look at the interface and playabillity are terrable. Movement is difficult especially out doors. Items are commonly very difficult to see and the tool that was built in to make it easy to see the items (left alt key) while showing some items it does not work for most. The game waypoint system failed. When you reached waypoints and game play paused showing it was saving but no save point was created. It is very difficult to determine who allies are in some combat scenarios. This is just a trainwreck of a game, but wait it gets better. How is this possible you ask..... This game is advertised as multiplayer and as a multiplayer game it is almost unplayable. Typically the software developer will blaim this on your connection quallity, however, in my cast that would be hard to do since the other player and I are both connected on gigabit Fiber internet connections. We for other reasons transfer large files of a secure nature to eachother so there is monitoring software involves that tracks connection quallity and speed as well as verifies it is secure. My reporting shows no issues with connectivity speed or quallity. Moving on... My view of the game as the organizer was fair, but the player I was playing with was dealing with horrific lag, random movements and actions. This is one of only a couple games I have ever owned I wish I had never purchased. I only played for a total of 8 or so hours but according to steam I had just under 53 hours played since purchasing it Saturday afternoon. This is because I exited the game 3 times but it never logged out, right before writing this review I discovered it WAS STILL RUNNING!!! and had to restart my PC to make it go away. I was so disappointed by this game because I was looking forward to the release for over a year... ;-(  "

267,Pixlow,305,44,19,2017-09-26,Recommended,244.5,"Paid some pimp in a tavern a 100 gold for a prostitude. Went up to the prostitude and had a long good talk about how she should actually be paying me for it, then said ""Now that we have established who is the most desireable here, i will take my leave"". She got mad and said i couldn't get a refund. Little did she know that i already had stolen my money back from her pimp.   10/10 Would steal from pimps and ???? with prostitudes again.   But in all honesty the game is great, the story is much easier to follow now that it is voice acted in my personal opinion. Upon reaching Reaper's Coast i have experianced some slight problems with perfomance, but other than that, the game has been going smoothly.   The turn based combat gets spiced up by the ground effects, you can either make great use of those mechanics or they can be your doom. Saving before battle is recommended. When combat gets challenging there is no shame in reloading a save to come up with new strategies to defeat your foe. Running from combat might also be the smartest move in some situations.  The origin characters give a nice dynamic to the singleplayer game, having them in your party leads to some memorable events between you and them. When you interract with an npc they have interrest in, they will let you know, you can either allow them to do their buisness or keep them away. This will lead to you bonding with that character. If they do something you do not like, you can often have a talk about it afterwards.  The music in the game is pretty good, but sometimes there is some mishaps where a piece of music that is out place plays. Nothing gamebreaking, but you can lose a bit of your immersion. You are able to pick 1 of 4 instruments when you make a character, you will hear these instruments being played in the level up music and etc.  Persuasion checks have been a little confusing for me, sometimes when i believe i definantly should be able to pass the skill check for an option i fail and other times where i think i should have failed, i passed. No idea if it is randomized or how it works."

448,WTWR Zydrate,426,4,0,2017-09-26,Recommended,101.2,"This is one of those games I wasnt really hyped for or interested in for a long time despite it haunting my wishlist for a while. At first it looked like a Diablo clone set in Divinitys universe which would have been enough for me. Instead, it became more of an older school Baldurs Gate/Icewind Dale type game with a bit of an XCOM flair to it. Theres many comparisons to be made but funnily enough, the game evokes the feeling of Morrowind and its general open endedness. It is a pleasant surprise.  Ysee, in Morrowind, you could literally kill anyone. Even the self-proclaimed living god Vivec. Youd be met with a type of error message telling you to reload or continue in the doomed world you have created. However DOS2 here actually doesnt care who you kill, because progress can be found on journals, diaries, or keys on anyones body.  Character creation is a fun process. Not a lot on the physical customization because you mostly just play through a tiny avatar through most of the game, but the nuances come in the skillsets and Origin characters. You can customize your own but the game comes with about five of their own, and mercifully you can customize their actual class so you can change the Enchantresss build to suit your personal playstyle (mine being rogue/assassin like people) regardless of how she usually starts as a default NPC.  Choosing one of them may be to your benefit as they get extra dialogues and experiences. I chose Lohse, an entertainer/bard type girl who once met a dwarf she was familiar with and despite the grim surroundings, had a bit of a musical duet together for about fifteen seconds and it was quite a sight to see. Youd miss such an interaction if you went just for a personal custom character.  The game begins on a prison ship, and Act 1 is placed on the prison island altogether. I didnt like the idea of being shackled for a while but the game does a great job of giving you plenty to do in what is essentially the games over extended tutorial. The amount of freedom I was able to acquire was staggering, even in the confines of the ship itself which is only the first twenty minutes of the game or so. In it, I could bash down doors, find a secret key for some extra loot, and even backtracked to murder a guard that was rude to me earlier, aftereeeeeehad hit the fan. It was awesome, and in that moment the game took me.  Theres a guy named Griff, the inmate who essentially controls the other inmates, even going so far as protection rackets and food supplies (he runs the kitchen). There was a chestpiece called Griffs Shirt on the ground, and hes flanked by another vendor who occasionally patrols away.  On a hunch, I decided to sneak behind him when that happened and steal his shirt. It worked! The items blurb says It was Griffs. Now its yours. Then I saw the patrolling vendor run over yelling Thief! Theres a criminal about! I just ran off, not wanting to test the games impressive AI to see if it could find me as the thief if I lingered in the area too long. I returned later, wearing his shirt and nobody was the wiser (which may in itself be a weaker point in the AI).  There will be some spoilers for Act 1, though my actions are hardly the only ones you can take.   To continue on the same line of how insane this game is with options, with the help of one of my online friends They led me to getting my collar removed, to which I was thrown into a dungeon for that. I dont know how non-thieves get out of that but I was able to lockpick my way out, retrieve my gear, find a waypoint which allowed the transport of my teammates into the dungeon itself and we proceeded to absolutely demolish the guards from the inside out. We basically cleared t"

Pros: ++ NPCs REACT to things and I can't describe how essential this is for a good RPG; the tag system, your class and race choice, talents and attributes, quest choices, etc, make the NPCs say different things each time, it doesn't even matter if they don't lead to major changes about half of the time, the fact that they exist puts this game a little over most other RPGs. ++ Constantly improving. ++ Can do an almost infinite combination of skills and classes, and pretty much all of them work. ++ Multiple ways to complete almost every single quest in the game. ++ Very good completionist game, requires no multiplayer and all achievements are related to single unique tasks or milestones, (needs more than one playthrough for 100% completion and needs at least one of those to be on honour mode). + Varied equipment and multiple armor sets. + Big open areas with epic fights that can lead to awesome adrenaline filled moments. + Rewards exploration, replaying the game, and learning the mechanics. + Can be played alone or with friends. + Larian Studios is one of the best developers out there, they published continuous game updates through the development process.  Cons (Keep in mind that most of these things mostly apply for Tactician or Honour mode): - - Tactician and Honour mode not only need vast knowledge of the game, but also luck and a strong focus on one source of damage. - - Requires one single Persuasion focused character and discourages you from using two of them since you can't use other characters to intervene during conversations using their own attributes for persuasion checks (like you can in Wasteland 2 for example), which makes the speaker feel like a lone adventurer everytime you're not in battle. - - As of March 2018, NPCs are doing weird things on tactician and honour, for example, making ice surfaces, then casting fire on them to make steam and water, then turning the surface back to ice; casting Death Wish on opponents and not using certain gap closing skills unless damage can be dealt right after. - Some skills feel really weak considering they cost the same points as others. - You may or may not like the armour system, I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me over time. - A certain talent (Lone Wolf) makes the game EXTREMELY easy, except for the starting area, when you don't have decent gear. - Easy to fall into minmaxing on these difficulties, since in reality, there isn't any other choice to beat them reliably."

10,Seresu,381,83,4,2017-09-26,Not Recommended,450.7,"Although I've been having a decent amount of fun with this game, I can't recommend it based on it still being incomplete. There's still far too many bugs in the quest system. In most games, completing an objective that is part of a quest you have not unlocked yet is not an issue. Once you accept the quest, it recognizes your current progress and incorporates it. In DoS 2, doing this is likely to permanantly break the relevant quests. What's more, these broken quests will auto-complete at the end of the current act with negative completion entries. It's entirely possible to save someone, only to complete an act and have your journal claim you abandoned them to their fate.  There are minor mechanical issues still existing as well. Barrels exploding fluids onto surfaces two floors above them, enemies healing from elements with 50% resistance, quests that require teleportation not accounting for retribution damage, an infinite ashen idol of rebirth bug that leaves your character permanantly unable to leave combat..  To top it off, the only bug Larian has recognized so far is an infinite damage loop. Despite sending in several reports that would ""be replied to within one business day"" I've now gone a week without a single piece of acknowledgement of the slew of quest related issues I'm experiencing.  TL;DR wait for them to fully finish the quest system, at least. So much outside the main line is in near shambles right now. The game is still fun, but you'll be constantly frustrated by impossible quests and a tarnished log."

A fair bit of railroading, but done in a way that most people wouldn't notice -Game can be unstable, with random CTD during dialog -Quests are unnecesarily vague in many cases.  I'm all for a game not holding my hand, forcing me to gather clues from reading journals, talking to people, etc., but for many quests I hit a wall, and lost interest in continuing, hoping to stumble upon the next step. -Crafting system is inefficient, and dated.  The Bad: -Bugs galore, from quest-killers, dialog glitches, suicidal AI pathing, and quest log incoherence. -Combat system is clunky, sluggish, and punishes you for it's own flaws.   -Initiative system is terrible.  Watch as your character gets shuffled down in real time so you miss 2 whole turns before acting, despite having a stellar initiative score.   -Unlike a truly freeform game like D&D tabletop, your choices are dictated by the parameters of the game architecture, rather than a human GM.  This makes predicting the outcome of almost any decision you make difficult, even if something makes sense.  Save-scum often, which isn't that fun, and breaks immersion. -No confirmation system in iventory management, crafting, or bartering.  This adds a level of difficulty in tedium that is unnecessary.  It's like having to make DEX checks while trading so you don't sell the wrong item. -Artificial difficulty curve that takes away from the overall experience of the story, which isn't so great to begin with. -Lazy storytelling that makes me feel like I'm playing a mediocre D&D game with a novice DM. -Arx is so buggy, even post-update (10/8/17), it is an exercise in frustration that had me eager to just finish the game and get it over with. -As of today, final battle crashes mid-fight during second phase.  Tried it several times, but it is unplayable, which has killed my interest in what happens at the end.    Overall: 5/10       I can understand why this game is getting so many accolades, but I feel that there needs to be more objective reviews out here. It is unique in a very important way: Couch Co-op.  It's one of a tiny handful of games that my wife and I can play together, and for that, we are both having fun despite the myriad flaws present.  Also, I admire Larian Studios' passion and dedication to their work, which seems a rare commodity in today's game industry.   EDIT 10/8/17: Final battle is buggy, crashes, and isn't actually that well designed as far as final battles go.  Game overall is a glitch-fest, combined with lazy, forced game design.  I may recommend it when an enhanced edition releases a year from now and everything is ironed out."

And you should go google right now how this game looks, and if you like any part of the game play...? YOU SHOULD BUY IT!   So, why the negative review? Well, honestly, it is the most effective way to me to give critizism where it is due, and for people going into this game with similar mindset such as me when it comes to UI and gameplay. It is 2017... And mods will block Achivments...!  REALLY?! In this day and age, mods will block achivments?   ******************************************** So, the first issue at hand: The Duality mindset of modding. This game have a healthy modding comunity out of the gate, and it will probably only get better with more talanted people going into this game. But... WHY DOES THIS BLOCK ACHIVMENTS?! It isn't like a big deal, I know that! Most of the achivments are mostly just to do certain task in a certain way, or jsut get to a certain ponit regardless of which path you took to get to the same goal.  But WHY is there system in place that basicly tells you ""NO! You shouldn't mod!"" --------------------- Because... despite how good this game is, there are some flaws with this game. --------------------- Some are subjective, like the balancing, but some are objective such as UI elements. Why try to dictate how any player should play their single player game?  I have been playing, and I am getting very frustrated on every... single... item... you pick up goes to the action bar. THE ACTION BAR IS A MESS AND A CONSTANT ????ING SOURCE OF ANOYANCE!  Here is an analogy: It's like, you clean your houes. You go about your day for an hour. And suddenly the houes is in the same vrecked state as you began with. :(  There are mods that limit what items get automaticly added to the action bar. They do not make enemies weaker... It doesn't make you stronger... All it does... is make a more enjoyable experience where you can focus more on the game, and not being a bloddy maid and keep cleaning your action bar every 5 steps in the game.   A mod that would make the game just objectivley more enoyable for us that wish to use it, can not be used. Because it would dissable achivments... ******************************************** Inbalanced mods:  And... let say you DO wanna play with a mod that changes game balance?  ... It is a single player game with co-op elements. Why not let people play as a god charachter if they want to? I don't want to... but I see NO reason as to why a person shouldn't be able to do as they wish!  Did anyone ever say in Skyrim; ""Man! I wish they would block achivments! Because if some random?????player wanted to put Randy Savage into the game as a dragon. That would make achivments pointless!"" ********************************************  ... I got nothing more to say! I mean, can anyone say anything more after using Randy Savage as a dragon, as a argument?  I rest my case!  So go ahead, do get the game! Because it is great! Just know, that any improvments you feel would make the game EVEN better, they don't really want you to use. :("

Even when fighting enemies of the same level, you will die a lot - save often!  Quests are all over the place, certainly not a linear game, but this can lead you into areas where you have no chance of winning a single battle,  You will find locked doors or areas requiring a key or item from someplace halfway across the map - that you dont even have a quest for.  It seems the idea of this game is to simply wander aimlessly, and return to places you got stuck on if you happen accross the item you needed.  Finally, be preparred to talk to every single NPC.  You will spend way more time walking and talking than actually battling, but at least you wont die as often when talking.

It has taken me 145 hours to complete Divinity Original Sin 2 and I just want to say that it was one of the best CRPG experiences that I have had since I finished Planescape Torment (for the first time) back in 2013.   Now onto the  Pro and Cons followed by my final thoughts.  Pro:   - Interesting story & interesting party members with choice & consequences - Amazing soundtrack - Great replayability (multiple endings, different classes & origins to pursue) - All dialogue is fully voiced (major props to Larian for taking the huge undertaking on fully voicing every line of dialogue in the game) - Robust crafting system - Interactive open world gameplay (picking up objects and moving them around to your advantage or to plan strategies) - Robust character & class customization with the option of respeccing  Cons:  - Optimization issues mainly in the second half of the game/later acts (solved via patches) - Some bugged quests that don't complete properly or don't trigger (solved via patches) - No search item bar option in the inventory for specific items (quality of life improvement)   Conclusion: The sheer amount of content and replayability that you get from this game is staggering and I cannot fathom how Larian have managed to create such an amazing game in such a short span of time (2 years).   I would like to thank Larian and everyone involved including the Kickstarter backers help create this masterpiece. The praise it has received from numerous gaming outlets is well deserved.  Now...do I recommend this game? This is one of those games that shouldn't be missed, because it's one of the best CRPG's ever created and if you have any incling of trying a turn based RPG then I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this game is worth your money."

The first two acts are incredible, beautifully polished and complete. The third act starts to get a bit weak, having a tendency towards very specific paths to continue, unlike the previous acts which give immense freedom in how you play and your choices mattering. The fourth act is nothing short of a trainwreck, critical pieces of information being easily missed (a book lying on a table in a completely optional area) and in one case, spoiling parts of the plot itself by giving me incorrect journal entries.  Ultimately, if you can put aside the huge drop in quality as the game progresses, it nets to be a fantastic game, unfortunately, I'm not one of those people. The later acts were nothing but pure frustration for me, and by the time I had finally finished, I had forgotten about the fun that I actually did have in the previous acts.  In short, since there isn't a mixed option, I have to recommend against it, but if you can get over the quality drop, it's well worth the price, otherwise wait until a sale."
17,Bellyache,38,35,1,2017-09-27,Not Recommended,52.6,"There's not much on the market for co-op, turn-based games. This game is much more fun with a friend, but it is wrought with bugs and poor design decisions. I am playing on tactician mode.  For one, being on high ground is advantageous, but enemies seem to be able to melee strike you despite being 15 feet below you.   Secondly, it seems like every single enemy type has some sort of teleport, jump, strong melee attack, and a ranged attack. So every fight is the same (minus differing terrains). You can get to high ground but everything can reach you and hit you without much trouble. There are crocodiles that throw magical boulders and dogs that shoot bolts from back-mounted crossbows. Every humanoid seems to have the polymorph flying ability. Making all enemy types essentially the same doesn't make the game ""hard,"" it just makes it stupid. How can I employ strategy when everything can fly and shoot me from wherever they are?  Third, line-of-sight seems to be screwy. Many times, I will be on high ground with no line-of-sight on something below, and yet that something can still shoot me in the face with arrows.   Fourth, the physical and magic armor system make it impossible to crowd control off the bat. Everything needs to be damaged first. It blows that my partner does physical damage and I do magical damage... it's like whittling away at two different health bars for the same monster.  Several other issues, but these are the most glaring ones. I would wait until this game gets some more patches in before shelling out forty some dollars for it."

I'm a huge fan of RPGs of all types, but I think this is the first one I've personally regretted purchasing. I have been playing since the 90's... have played every style except a legit D&D style game such as this. I thought Neverwinter Nights (which I loved)was legit D&D, but I can only surmise from this games success that I was wrong and this is just directed at those hardcore pencil and paper folks.       It is VERY slow moving. Forget that it's turn based, forget playing with 1 character, and forget rushing into ANY fight. It's slow - almost awkwardly so. I would say at least 90% of playing is dialogue play. There is very little combat, and I think this was on purpose. Combat is meant for playing with a full party - and even then it is VERY difficult to win without thoroughly understanding the mechanics. Unfortuantely, you don't get much practice to get familiar with them so that the fights are even enjoyable. I've wiped my entire party on every fight except the Voidwoken(overgrown maggots). I just cannot bring myself to put this on easy difficulty.       Unfortunately, the dialogue and how the story was delivered wasn't enough to keep me playing. And even then, I'd say the story telling is mediocre at best. It's simply not compelling enough to keep at it. I tried playing several times before I just got frustrated, read similar reviews, got bored then just uninstalled. It is a beautiful game with a lot of attention to detail, however, it just doesn't do enough to keep your normal RPG guy playing. For this reason, I'm going to have to go with a ""Do not recommend"" on Steam. Very sad."

I'm giving it a thumbs down because devs will read this suggestion which is very important.  1 Suggestion only:  Prevent save scumming. I'm a good person but I can't help save scumming. I go back and do other options for the best results. Something bad happened? I go back. I wanna know what would happen if I chose the other dialogue? I go back and %99 of your playerbase do this too. I've spent 25+ hours in fort joy, exploring all the possible options, now fort joy is not offering me anything so it'll be a drag on the next run. Prevent SAVE SCUMMING. Make it rogue-like or whatever, your team can come up with good ideas. Don't let us exploit this beautiful options."
153,Halwin,838,156,5,2017-09-28,Recommended,190.5,"C'mon, become Overwhelmingly Positive already! While at the time of writing this review, I haven't even gotten past the first Act yet, I nevertheless feel compelled to write a review for this beautiful game. For me the game's highlight is its excellently designed turn-based combat. There are no potentially pesky RNG elements and therefore every fight follows the same strict rules allowing you to have full control over how every battle plays out. There's also an insane amount of skills that are open to each and every character, and free to combine at your leisure (half of the fun is simply experimenting!). While the game is very very challenging (in a good and fair way!), I never felt the need to look up guides as with some thought you are more than able to compose your own diverse team of heroes (except maybe on hard difficulty - but don't play that until you finished Classic!). The voice acting is also superb, with tons and tons of spoken dialogue and different choices you can make. Also initiating a dialogue with another of your team members may open up a whole different story which may reveal more of the character you are interacting with or the world around you. Finally, the graphics look more than impressive enough considering the game's genre, and the level design has nothing to complain about.  Admittedly, no game is without its flaws though and I will summarise my, minor, grievances here. Inventory management is still a hassle. It's a common issue for RPGs, and I'm not sure if there ever will be a game that's perfect in that regard, but with four party members, switching items to and fro, out and in of backpacks and the like, becomes a considerable hassle. Especially when it can be hard to discern between quest items, crafting materials, fluff, and junk. To add to that, civic skills like bartering and lucky charm (increases your chance to find rare items with that player only) are not group-wide, meaning that you will have to switch items (and gold) to and fro your characters yet again to reap the maximum gold and good gear. Frankly, I don't bother with the last two because it's a serious nuisance, and it doesn't really make the game too hard without. Nevertheless a fix to this inconvenience would be appreciated. Furthermore, certain skills are either useless - initiative: determines the play order during a fight for your team only, meaning that having one at 13, then 12, 11, 10 is sufficient and any extra points are basically lost, - or certain skills provide odd bonuses - warfare: a melee oriented skill that apparantly is the best damage increase for rangers as well (I do have a ranger in my team with 5 huntsman and 0 warfare however, and he's perfectly viable on Classic. I only need to make sure he's positioned with a height advantage, which is actually how the game intended rangers to be played). Last, but not least, there's no way to change party members during a conversation, meaning that if you are forced into a dialogue (probably because he/she was closest to the conversation starter) with someone and a persuasion check needs to be passed, it is impossible to have your player with skill in pursuasion take it over (this led to frequent quickloads for me). Basically during dialogue your team members turn into mutes unless they are scripted to take part in the conversation.   I didn't intend for the second paragraph to be longer than the first, and I would recommend to pay more focus to the great things this game offers rather than the minor nuisances. I will give this game a higher rating once some (or all) of these issues are addressed, which I actually expect they will.   TL;DR: A must buy even at full price! It currently has the well deserved spot of #10th best game ever!  P.S. Feel free to reply to this review with questions; I usually reply rapidly. Also, if you decided to buy the game after reading this I'd be happy to help you out with the game, or play with you co-op if our times align! :)  Rating: 9.0/10 Halwin's 100% Completion RecommendationDifficulty: Unsure, but considering honour mode achievement I expect 9/10. Time: Expect it to be easily 150+ hours  Will update this section once I have completed the game."

393,SlNx,115,4,0,2017-09-28,Recommended,74.2,"To know if you need to buy this game or not, answer those questions !  - Do you like RPGs ? - Do you want to fall for a game like you did for Witcher 3 ? - Did you like Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance II back then ? - Did you enjoy Dragon Age (the first one) but found it too ""dull"" ? - Do you like fantastic stories ?  If you answered YES to, at least, one of the above: You need this game. If you answered YES more than once, you need it even more. Especially if you have no time in your life as well as empty pockets.  This game feels like the most satisfaying experience you could have after playing, and enjoying, Witcher 3. "

1875,Jentleman Jack,39,2,0,2017-09-28,Recommended,63.2," This game was just godly, the choices, the dialogue, exploration and combat.  The story, or stories more like, was truly engaging as was building a connection with the characters.  And with the choices to create my own, I did just that, an avatar to interact with the world set together by the true gods.  I quite enjoy the presence of sophisticated types regardless of how rude they may be, along with my affinity for lizard-like races, chose to be a blue ocean in the form of a lithe lizard, who with a mixture of bow and magic, controlled my enemies, and aided my allies.  On my journy was my three companions who have more than proved their friendship.   To begin was the vocals of the group, Lohse who with her mastery of summoning, most disconcerning interest in electrocution along with her words of encouragement(and madness) made for a friend worth staying in the back with and babying the rough'n'tough boys when they've had too much of a spanking.   Then theres the Beast who, in-spite of being quite short, excelled at movement, cutting down enemies as quickly as knocking them onto their????? and with being a dwarf and a pirate no less, was enthusiastic, joyous and free as a dwarven pirate should be, whilst Lohse was the voice to the song, the Beast would always be the first to sing along.   And last, but definitely no least was the understandably arrogant Red Prince, tamer of flames, a true beefcake to my slender form, and as brutal with the shield as he is with his sword.  And somewhere along the lines his ""Fire"" met my ""Water"" and together created steam if you know what I mean, sure he was destined to another, but this here was the closest thing to true love.  Hm, but how far exactly did that ""love"" go, if you catch my meaning, meh, a fan-fiction to keep to my own.   But the hardest part about all of this, the story, your companions, was saying goodbye in the end, to say, this is it.  To end the journey and part ways with those of which you have made it so far with was quite heart wrenching.  I almost didn't want to say goodbye, but a story has to end.  For me, I would have wanted to keep playing after the epilogue, to be a god and explore the world as a one-lizard band.  Maybe even return to the Ancient Empire, see how everything fares with the Red Prince, share a few drinks, and reminisce upon our old adventures.  Perhaps we even get the whole gang together for another adventure, just like good old times.  But to say goodbye, to say goodbye was so hard, to part ways with friends, those who have been together with you through so much, is always hard, and sometimes, imagination alone isn't enough to mend the emptiness filled by adventures, especially ones with those you have melded with.    I guess this is more a tale rather than an actual review, or perhaps it is a review in the shape of a tale but even with the very small flaws in this diamond, I shall cherish this game for what it accomplishes.  A good story, a world full of surprises and secrets, and a band of friends I would forever play god with til' the end.  But I demand nothing more from Larian studios for they have made their sacrifices to deliver something no triple A game developer could get quite right.  I shall see to it that I myself create new adventures, because with the tools Larian has provided, we can all become story tellers, and we can all be pathfinders for our own adventures. -10/10 ...Would definitely adventure again."
98,RyanVodka,63,19,0,2017-09-28,Not Recommended,130.8,"Great game ruined by a flawed combat system.  I really wanted to like this game. The majority of what is there is top notch, but the double armor system drags the whole thing down. The way combat is designed forces you to abandon creative team builds in favor of either stacked melee or stacked caster teams.   I think the team imagined that allowing any character to learn any skill would encourage creative and interesting builds. Unfortunately it ends up doing the opposite. Nearly every enemy is designed to be able to defend against jack of all trades characters.   I understand that the enemies are weighted one side over the other either being more armored in physical than magical or vice versa, but It is very frustrating when its your turn and the character you are using is nearly useless because they are just going to end up chipping away at armor pool of the opposing armor type or simply being a buff bot for your other character. All you can think about is that you would have killed that character if you wouldnt have tried to have a diverse team build."
234,Captin0bvious,114,4,0,2017-09-28,Not Recommended,0.6,"I got the game to play with a buddy of mine and the loading bar stops at about 80% when trying to connect. After looking on multiple forum, this is a common issue. Single player works fine but thats not why I got the game. I got it to play with friends like it was advertised and can't do that. Booooooo."
515,Rooba,306,4,1,2017-09-28,Not Recommended,95.5,"It's interesting, long, packed with turn-based combat and a lot of dialogs and hidden stuff you have to explore. Now, when we are done with typical overhyped idiomas, let's talk facts.  This game sucks, especially when compared to the first Original Sin.  Unfair: you play as a living skeleton, but you're not immune to bleeding, though similar skeletal enemies are; should you take Glass Cannon as your talent - you'll be the #1 target for all enemies' status effect skills; your enemies ALWAYS have WAY more AP than you do.  Weaker: this game is missing personality system that was there in the first Original Sin. Your characters talk to each other after some things happened, but all for nothing. New physical and magic armor system is plainly stupid.  Diablo 3: remember your tank had 3k HP in the first game and it was awesome? Now you need more then 10k to survive barely, or even more. Waiting for 330.3M damage numbers to show up. This is followed by a simple problem - items of level 19 are significantly weaker than items of level 20, for example, and mind the cost in gold.  Co-op is broken: some aspects of the game are ridiculously broken in co-op, like NPC getting stuck in dialogs, fights, where you skip the first turn because or something etc.  Bugs: a lot of them. The farther you get the more broken it gets. Looks like someone got quite a rough night trying to finish the game faster than possible.  Too damn long: game does not show nothing new to you. We played 80 hours and it's still the same broken game. You just get tired of it at some point, as it gets boring as hell.  To sum up. I love Original Sin 1, I tried to love Original Sin 2, look at my playtime. Me and my friends struggled a lot to go through and see the ending, but looks like it's impossible. Shame on you, Larian."
586,Canton,91,3,1,2017-09-28,Not Recommended,17.5,"The armor system is shoehorned into this game in such a way as that many class combinations that are natural in most games of this type are useless; and there is no documentation warning people of this.  SImply put, you don't want to be doing both magical and physical damage at the same time, because you are then required to force your way through both armor types; there is no good reason to do this.  The result is that many skills simply don't work together, and the clusterf#ck is worsened when you attempt to pick classes and skills for  your party; only to find out later in the game that you chose wrong, and are now underpowered.  The problem is that they forced this beta idea into the game without testing it properly, and documenting its effects.  The result is that you get to restart over and over and over again until you figure out what works with what.  Paying money to beta test a product is an extremely anti-consumer business model; especially when the game has not been released in 'beta' mode.  Short version:  don't bother with this pay for beta release until at the very least guides come out explaining how to build your party properly."
936,emitfudd,23,1,7,2017-09-28,Not Recommended,2.9,"I am so confused by all the glowing reviews. I was so excited to play this game and thought this would be something like Skyrim but 10 times better. Here is what I found after playing for just 2 hours.   The camera angle is ridiculous. You are looking down upon your character from around a 45 degree angle. I am constantly trying to look ahead or up but you simply can't. It is like driving a car but you keep getting pulled into the ditch. So frustrating. If you zoom the camera in everthing surrounding your immediate field of view becomes blurry. Zooming out so you can actually see a little bit of what is going on around you makes everything so small. I am playing on a 27 inch monitor and my character is less than an inch tall.   I absolutely hate the combat system. In the first fight the game just took complete control of the fight. I couldn't move. I had no idea what was going on. There is no freedom whatsoever to attack or move freely as you wish.   The narrative is so boring. Every single person you encounter leads to a dialogue and the narrator pops open this huge box right in the middle/top of your screen. I wanted to play a game, not read a book.  I changed my settings for audio/video etc. The next time I started the game they had all reverted back to the default settings.   I can't believe that so many people are claiming this to be the best RPG of the decade. I have played Skyrim, Fallout 4, Dragon age inquisition and loved them all. I simply can't play this game. I have asked Steam for a refund.   "
1094,Rabid Elevator Midget,94,No,0,2017-09-28,Not Recommended,201.8,"I used to give this game a thumbs up but after playing through it twice and spending hours and hours dealing with bugs, bad programming, missing quests, missing vendors, white boxes where my items should be, broken skills, and just plain bad design in several areas of the game I can't honestly recommend it.  It's got so many bugs, so many issues, so many badly scripted areas that I've honestly spent half my play time trying to game around the constant bugs. I can't go through a single act of the game without encountering at least five bugged quests, two bad encounters, and two persuasion checks that either do nothing or have options that auto fail no matter what your stats are.  I'm sick of missing out on content because they can't beta test properly. I'm sick of missing vendors, missing quest givers, and auto-failing quests because of absolutely mental failure states like accidentally wandering into the next area (I'm looking at you act three). I'm sick and tired of most of the gear I find being underleveled and useless and having to mass sell everything I find so I can buy one or two decent gear upgrades and I'm sick of the number bloat at end game where an item two levels higher is more than twice as good as an item you have so I have to totally regear my entire party every two levels. It's not fun, it's tedious and it takes away any real excitement at finding rare gear because you know in about an hour or two it'll be useless.

It's got so many bugs, so many issues, so many badly scripted areas that I've honestly spent half my play time trying to game around the constant bugs. I can't go through a single act of the game without encountering at least five bugged quests, two bad encounters, and two persuasion checks that either do nothing or have options that auto fail no matter what your stats are.  I'm sick of missing out on content because they can't beta test properly. I'm sick of missing vendors, missing quest givers, and auto-failing quests because of absolutely mental failure states like accidentally wandering into the next area (I'm looking at you act three). I'm sick and tired of most of the gear I find being underleveled and useless and having to mass sell everything I find so I can buy one or two decent gear upgrades and I'm sick of the number bloat at end game where an item two levels higher is more than twice as good as an item you have so I have to totally regear my entire party every two levels. It's not fun, it's tedious and it takes away any real excitement at finding rare gear because you know in about an hour or two it'll be useless.

343,Francis,409,5,0,2017-09-29,Recommended,290.3,"Highly recommend this game. Even if you're not a typical fan of computer rpgs. Everything is voice acted, which means eyes glossing over reading walls of text for hours straight doesn't happen. The combat is fun and the game feels really polished. There is a couple things they're tweaking/balancing which will polish everything out, not to say there is huge issues however.  My biggest gripe with the game is that itemization is a little unrewarding. Majority of the time, a uncommon items of a tier higher than rares, epics and even uniques of a teir below is strictly better. That's not fun imo, so it makes managing gear sometimes annoying/tedious vendoring shoping for upgrades each level.   Multiplayer is great, and I'm already stoked to replay the game adding that element."

I rate it better than my favorites Baldurs Gate and Baldurs Gate 2. While I don't give this better marks than Witcher 3 (I mean... seriously I don't see how you could), this title is supremely worthy of purchase to anyone who calls themselves an RPG fan.  I could go on and on about how interesting the character building is in this game, but its probably one of the more frustrating aspects of the title. Their are so many choices, its difficult to fit all of them in, in a single play through. While I do consider their to be some balancing issues between physical/melee and ranged/magic, I do imagine that player mods will one day solve this.  If players committed to making engrossing campaigns (or the developers continued to add-on to this title) I'd be set in my deeply-rooted RPG needs for years to come.  Kudos to them for actually coming up with a storyline that interested me, and wasn't filled with standard fantasy tropes. I really enjoyed this, despite not having completed it yet.

The hot bars should work properly.  Skills shouldn't randomly be added and removed.  I love the game, I enjoy playing it.  But the bugs which aren't addressed ruin the experience completely.  For a game meant to really immerse yoursef in the experience, the bugs create a really jarring experience.  Also, puzzles in games like this ruin the gaming experience.

Do not spend money on it now if you aren't a diehard divinity fan, it will frustrate you with all the broken quests, broken mechanics, spelling errors, and story glitches.  Most, yes most quests are bugged in one way or another, and trying to complete them in the not perfect order, or heck even talking with the wrong party member, will break the quest and it'll never be able to be finished.

349,Homongoloid,579,6,1,2017-09-29,Not Recommended,115.6,"I can't recommend this game in it's current state. It's currently so imbalanced and glitchy that I can't even properly enjoy it, it just frustrates me. If horrible bugs and horrible balance don't ruin the experience for you, and you're fine with the game feeling pretty indie (Conversations are entirely dialogue, for example, and actions are always narrated without ever even slightly matching what the models are actually doing) then it's a great game, and you should buy it on sale. But if you're picky, or annoyable, then I'd wait for them to fix these issues.. If they ever do, they were brought up before the game was released and they did nothing about them. I'd recommend the first game if you're going to get either, which has it's share of issues but not as many as this game.  If you want some very detailed information on this game, read this thread. It's very informative and goes quite in-depth to the balance issues of the game, but doesn't really talk about the glitches:  http://larian.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=621419&#Post621419  The thread summarized is how forcing enemies to go every other turn prevents strategy and can make killing enemies detrimental, the AI is both smart enough to be psychic to know everything about everyone while also stupid enough to walk away from you to hurt themself before turning around to hit you with an attack they were in range for the whole time, the new armour system hurts team compositions that aren't entirely physical (and preferably 2 lone wolves), the old defensive abilities were deleted in place of this new and bad armour system, there are tons of useless things that you should never level up / obtain, the butchering of the attributes and slaughtering of any depth or complexity, how initiative is completely useless, and a few other things.  What that thread doesn't talk about, however, is the bugs. The horrible bugs that are everywhere. Moving might sometimes take 1 more AP than it said it did, ruining your turn. Moving might hit you with an attack of opportunity, even though it didn't show the indicator that it would and you were hugging the enemy. Moving might make your party members run off in separate, random directions and engage combat. Moving through anything that is detrimental is incredibly annoying, since the pathfinder will do it's best to force you to not step into anything hazardous for even a millisecond (even though stepping in it does basically nothing), yet will have your followers loiter in shrieker death-zones for an hour until they die. Clicking on yourself to buff yourself, when you are clearly on the middle of your character, might target a corpse behind you and give the dead enemy armour instead. Clicking an enemy to attack them a second time will instead make you move if you clicked just slightly too quickly. Dialogue will sometimes not happen at all, skipping an entire part of the conversation leaving you confused, and when it does happen it may or may not have even half of what was said. Dialogue automatically starting and being unjoinable for party members, so only one person can enjoy it. Or how vital NPCs may not spawn, triggers may not happen, and your dialogue choices won't register so you keep repeating the conversations repeatedly.  Even without counting how annoying all of the bugs are, the game's balance is still undesirable at best. You're given 4 Action Points per turn, which is what you use to do your actions, and it has a cap of 6, meaning you reach the full extent of what you can do in one turn in 1.5 turns. In the first game you had 7 max AP and every point of Constitution you levelled up, you would get one more AP. This let you actually do more things than just punch someone twice, or walk a little close then punch them once. In the first game, you could actually allocate your stats to what you think would be best. There were defensive things, offensive things, spell things, a bunch of stuff. In this, it's basically +5% damage or putting it into a spell school so you're better at casting that kind of spell. You can't increase your baby-sized AP unless you halve your party size, you can't get abilities to resist CC since the armour removes any anticipation and just makes everything ""Definitely"" or ""Definitely not"", you can't do anything about how you build your character other than ""Slightly stronger"" or ""Can now also get this school of magic"".  There's a mod to give you 8 max AP, but mods disable achievements. There's a mod to halve armour and add it to VIT so that mixed teams can work, and crowd controls ever see any use. But mods disable achievements. There's a mod that lowers the cooldown of mage spells since mages are severely underpowered... but mods disable achievements. There's a mod that makes it so that things don't just constantly get spammed onto your hotbar, filling up any open slot there is even if it's before the end of the hotbar, making the hotbar the most disorganized thing in existence that requires constant upkeep to make it not horribly ugly, but mods disable achievements. There's mods to slow down levelling, or lower the huge difference between levels because currently you have to swap out gear every level because of the giant bloat between levels, but mods disable achievements.  I know I'm forgetting at least half of what I want to write about, so I'll probably update this review later. If they fix enough of these issues I'll change the review from negative to positive."

I have been playing since the first Divinity. However my favorite entry in the series is still Divinity II. I loved the third person engine in that game and it felt like a step forwards for the series. Sadly the last two Original Sin entries feel like a step backwards. Not in story but in execution. Try as I might I just cannot get into the Isometric style of this current game. The story is great but the gameplay is frustrating. Not being unable to climb up onto a ledge that is one foot higher than the one I am on just got too frustrating. Especially when on the very same map you can traverse a rock slide. After the umpteenth 'Cannot Reach' message and having to spin the view around to see where I was I just gave up. I enjoyed Baldur's Gate as much as the next person.. back in the 90s but please for the next one (and I hope there is a next one) consider a better engine. Or just improve on the divinity 2 one.

Wanna play as undead? Have fun with that, after fort joy the next area is impossible to beat and thats if you can even make it through fort joy. And thats only on classic/medium difficulty -Gameplay- Artistically the game is great and it really makes you want to love it but.... The gameplay kills it. you're tightly defined to what you spec into whether that be one school or two, generally not more than 3. low and behold just to make the game difficult and ???????? they decided to make the enemies you face in the first 20 minutes of the game have abilties from 6 different schools. you will have a??????whos a witch who uses necromancy and scoundrel(rogue basically) abilties, who also uses pyro and hydro spells, who also can use nether swap, who is also apparently a polymorph because he can turn people into chickens. I could kind of get it if it was some big bad boss whos up in high level high difficulty content. or maybe even if i was playing on honoured mode or w/e (hardest difficulty).  Its also a turn based game that cant seem to keep track of who's turn it is. the game will bug out and give you or the enemies 2 turns on the same character for no reason. the enemies will be allowed to attack with all 4 of their characters at once whereas you will usually only be able to attack once or cast one spell per turn and thats if you dont have to run your?????out of one of the milions of ???????? tedious damaging surfaces that are just everywhere because why the ???? not, most of this game doesnt even feel like you're actually fighting it just feels like you're positioning yourself to use and abuse the surfaces to no end because theres no way to progress without doing it because thats the game. This is all while putting you into 4 vs 8 fights where every enemy is stronger than each of your party members. However, probably the most infuriating and glaring issue that make you want to slit your wrists right there at your keyboard is that line of sight only works for you. the enemies can cast and attack through walls, through the floor of the high ground, and from seemingly impossible angles and distances. Also make sure you save everytime you do anything anytime because if may just walk into some area you think has no enemies and then you're suddenly locked in a fight you cannot possibly win in any conceivable way. If you dont f5 save often and because their autosaves are placed in the worst possible places and times you will get put into the predicament where you either start over (not realistic if you're deep in the game) or you loose ridiculous amounts of progress because you have to load a older save because if you choose your most recent you will be immediatly placed back into said unwinnable fight. -""RPG""- RPG is a pretty broad genre but unless you're playing as an Origin character theres not really any RP to be found. theres confusing persuasion events that decide the outcome of minor inconsequential events but most of the time no matter what you say to an NPC they will give you the same dialogue option in response. even with the origin characters as party members you basically just get to watch them act their own??????out so you dont really make any descisions for them anyway you just get to comment on it to them. RPG 2/10  -Character Creation- you're just gonna confuse people having like 10 class presets when it really dumbs down to like 3 ????ing stats. just let people switch between 3 or 4 its not like you cant change the stats to make yourself whatever you want regardless of what preset you choose. other than that the variation and variety is very nice however it would be nice if dwarf racials weren't so meta for most builds, dont wish the dwarf racials were weaker just wish the human, lizard, elf, and undead especially were stronger. 7.5-8/10 The customization is nice it just might confuse new people.  TLDR; Fix the Swamp/Marsh, Fix the ???????? enemies in the first 30 minutes of the game with abilties from 6-8 different schools, FIX THE ????ING LINE OF SIGHT LARIAN! Seriously fix the impossible areas for undead.  Edit: Also would highly suggest the workshop mod ""No psychic enemies"" the name says it all and the fact this mod even exists says a lot about the game.  Knowing Larian this will probably get taken down anyway."

167,[FTA]TatsuyaSuou,289,131,20,2017-09-30,Recommended,114.8,"While there isn't a lot that hasn't already been addressed in other positive reviews, I feel obligated to address some of the negative reviews I continually see regarding the game's difficulty.  Like any strategy-oriented game, Divinity Original Sin 2 requires quite a bit of premeditation before entering combat to guarantee success (outside of Tactician mode anyway, more on that later).    The game expects you to use the tools it gives you in each encounter though the largest issue I've seen is when you enter a new section of the game.  Before you go exploring to much it's almost mandatory to address the guaranteed difficulty creep by checking out any and all new gear/skillbooks/potions etc are available in whatever new social area you encounter.  With the game's economy being what it is, having one character geared toward thievery and another set up with a significant amount of barter goes an incredibly long way toward alleviating the need to almost constantly upgrade your gear when entering a new section of the game.  The point I'm making is that the game gives you all the tools you need to address any gear issues you might have the moment you set foot in a new town. This goes for skill books as well as there is no limit to how many books you can learn as long as you have the commensurate ranks in the associated skill and sufficient memory slots to equip them.   Anyway, the TL;DR of all that is the game gives you all the tools you need to PREPARE for difficult fights so long as you actually use them.  All that said, the AI isn't a slouch.  It can and will abuse whatever environmental things are to hand and the devs have set up a great many of the fights to favor the enemies.  This means that as a player the onus is on you to think about the party you want to put together before just trying to breeze through the game.  There are so many ways to make strong characters in D:OS 2 that they're almost limitless.  What you CAN'T do and expect to be successful is to just blindly charge into every fight and new situation with your d*** at full mast (just a turn of phrase, no offense intended ladies).  If that's the playstyle you're after there are a dozen Diablo clones or ARPGs out there that are better suited to that frame of mind.  D:OS2 has a turned-based system for a reason and is incredibly rewarding just so long as you apply some forethought to engagements. In fact, it's easily the best RPG I've played since the early 2000s in terms of gameplay.   Panning a game for being difficult is a non-starter, especially when it's only as hard as you make it by lack of planning. Unless, of course, you're playing on Tactician mode.  If you're doing that, you deserve whatever mental anguish you're suffering from because that is almost entirely designed for masochists who like to sit bare???????on a saguaro cactus.  If that's you, by all means, buy stock in razor blades or whatever but I would seriously hope to not see any complaints about difficulty."

It will be very difficult to replay some of my old-school games having played this now, as I'm ready to replay it again.   I can't really think of a quality that is lacking for a proper RPG -- companions, combat, story (a little bumpy in spots if you're not used to Divinity lore), music, voice acting, dialog, puzzles, loot, character building....it's all there.  Plus the fact the tone is both dark and clever with many humorous moments yet not very goofy and cartoony like the first one is a real winner in my book.   There are a few bugs here and there, but other than that, I feel it deserves the GoTY Award.   Update: PC Gamer 2017 Game of the Year Award I guess I have good taste...or PC Gamer does. Yeah, I'll go with the latter, the former wasn't in doubt.   Nominated for Steam Award: Better than Expected"

I didn't check for a week but after some more time I took a look. 10 minutes after first checking out the game I bought it and here I am, almost 100 hours in the game.  The game is huge, we played the first act for 20+ hours, and there are 4 acts! The gameplay is very interactive and feels great, you can, for example, create a puddle of acid and set it ablaze!  EVERYTHING is voice acted and the graphics look beautiful. Also the combat system is great for players that like tactical games. Your positioning and skill usage matter a lot, 1 wrong move might cause the end of you.  There's also a ton of replay value due to all the different classes, origin stories and decisions that you make. On top of that there's the Game Master mode where you can create your own campaign or play the ones from others aswell as the workshop which already has a ton of stuff on it.  The only 2 things that I dislike so far is the fact that a few quests have a tendency to bug out making you unable to complete the quest. Also the mages in this game are kinda underwhelming. Physical characters are much more potent. Im hoping they'll take a look into that.  All in all a great game and possibly one of the best rpgs ive played so far. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play rpgs and being able to play this game for months to come."

1739,Eri,117,2,0,2017-09-30,Recommended,113.6,"Just wanted to give a quick thumbs up for this game because it absolutely deserves the positive praise it's been getting.   I've been having a blast playing with my partner in crime. It's perfect for co-op if you're looking to adventure into an interesting world with 3 other friends or just your favorite person, I highly recommend it.   You really have to communicate with your team or partner about what roles each other will be playing if you want to succeed in this game. For example, I'm the persuasive barterer and lockpicker, with an archer and knight. My boyfriend is the item finder and crafter, who plays a healer/summoner/buffer and a battlemage. Our team works pretty perfectly together. Defeating enemies after a long battle with no one dying because the both of us expertly communicated with one another over who to hit and what moves to make, etc, is extremely satisfying. I even feel much closer to him because of how well we work together, the game is quite the bonding experience.   It's also fun laughing at some of the many absurd interactions in the game, like being licked by a dog whose been eating corpses and ending up getting deseased because of that, all because you told the dog it was a good boy.   Long story short, I recommend this game as both a great solo experience, and an incredible muiltiplayer experience.  Update: The game is still fantastic."

You cant experience a game when some 50% of quest legit wont update, advance,and complete. Anyone who owns this game that reads this knows exactly what Im talking about. Its frustrating being locked out on valuable experience to level up because a quest wont complete. And to make matters worse when you advance through the main quest line you auto fail any quest that wouldnt finish even though you did them! This IS an early access game I dont care what anyone tells me."
274,DevilFish,77,10,1,2017-09-30,Not Recommended,178.2,"Lots of people are talking about pros so I'ma share some cons.  This game will waste your time away, and by waste I mean WASTE. For starters you have to be save scum to the max. There are elements in the game that are insta-kill, and it will destroy you as simply as opening an unmarked door. Some battles will made you replay over and over and over and over again. Also if you don't invest in teleportation, you'll literally be dropped in a fiery pit with no means of getting out. Who knew? Or perhaps you'll enter a new area, be locked in a dialogue with no hope talking your way out, then being pulled into a fight and wiped out in the first turn (of course the enemy goes first...).   Long battles. Some people love the strategy in them. But as deep as the mechanics go, it gets pretty stale by your 100th tangle. What also gets stale is how long it takes for moves and attacks to animate out. If there are 10+ characters and an uneasy terrain, a fight can take well over 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and if you lose you'll have to redo it! (Unless you saved -midbattle).  Levelling system means in order to stay well equiped for adventure you'll need to spend about HALF OF YOUR TIME managing your inventory and buying/selling with merchants. You grow no attachment to your items, there is not a smug of aesthetic customization as most items both look the same and you can't see them until you put them on. Plus this isn't Skyrim so you can't just loot whatever exists in the game. Its more old school and loot is either randomly generated or placed.  A lack of seriousness. Sure there's a bounty of comedy in the game. But as far as I can tell you don't really get attached to any characters or their interests along the way. Sure there isn't a forceful light or dark path for you to take, rather its usually a I-Don't-Even-Care kind of path you end up on.  Level design is nothing new. Dragon Age has more memorable places and more interesting map corners.  Psychic enemies knowing your weaknesses. You'll literally need a mod in the workshop to make it a little more realistic and not computerized. Also you'll begin to realize that some battles have pre-programed movesets for the enemies, such as a marksman immediately teleporting to some far-reaching platform right away. This both makes fights really repetitive and also very procedural. PROCEDURAL.  Quests that don't Close. There's about a dozen or so quests that just won't Close properly. If you have OCD this game might just kill you. Plus the instructions are stylishly like a journal - in other words - often do not provide direct instructions. Think this makes it more immersive? NOT WHEN YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOUR CHARACTER EVEN MEANS IN HIS/HER OWN JOURNAL.  Soul-less characters. Revenge is a common option in the game. Most of the time its meaningless if the characters are described to be stoic and unhinged til oblivion.  90% of enemies know magic. 90% of enemies have ranged attacks. Even 'swordsman'. FYI.  Hotkeys that shift around even after you 'locked' them.  Confusing exterior-transitions. Usually to enter a building you have to click move into a space that isn't revealed yet (until you enter). How many times have I accidently 'stole' something as I'm trying to enter a building....  If you can overlook these gripes (and some others), then I'll recommend this game..."

I really wanted to enjoy this game (huge baldurs gate, pillars of eternity, etc. fan), but it is absolutely riddled with bugs at the moment, and because of the lack of polish on quests, you can wander around for a while not knowing that your quests are bugged, or what you're supposed to do next.  Many quests are poorly implemented, with no direction given.   The difficulty levels are poorly spaced.  ""easy"" mode, is ridiculously simple, and makes it virtually impossible to die, while ""normal"" requires substantial prior knowledge of the game's spells, tactics, and item locations, and encourages cheesing of fights.  There is no ""I want a challenge, but without googling 3rd party sites every few minutes"" setting.   Really disappointed because at it's core, it has all the assets needed for a great game - its just implemented poorly, especially given the length of the alpha/beta tests."

Win a few fights, have a few party member deaths? OOPS - you're out of resurrection scrolls, your party is permanently dead - unless you can find 1,000+ gold to buy a scroll (which you can't, there's not enough lootable items in Fort Joy Ghetto (the starting zone) to purchase even one scroll). From the start, the enemies you face are fully equipped with good weapons, shields, and scale/plate armor - whereas you're wearing rags and wielding a shiv or a makeshift hammer. Only on its easiest difficulty is combat realistically winnable in the beginning, but then it's so easy it's just meaninglesss. Unless you like facerolling on easymode or playing through the first zone a hundred times to learn about how to make a good party of heros, don't bother with this game.  I thought it could be the heir to Baldur's Gate and other similar awesome RPGs, but this is simply not fun. It could have been fun had the difficulty gradually ramped up instead of being a vertical wall of frustration.  TLDR; If you like the feeling of wanting to punch your computer in frustration, buy this game and cherish it. If you like having fun, play something else. I'm uninstalling it and never looking back."

So everything here bases on the final thing  Remark 2: I don't give a damn about hype or hate. I usually don't read a single word about a game prior to purchase and decide to purchase based on experience and judgement of the presentation. And due to high age and experience I usually don't fail there hehe) )  Woah! What a masterpiece RPG. I really already liked the first DOS (and its predecessors, although completly different, too). And I'm not much into turn-based top-down (more or less, I know it's 3D) RPGs at all. And this time they really managed to drag you into their world. Many races, interesting locations, tons of secrets, tons of sidequests, billions of lines of conversations... It's not a perfect game, and surely has some tiny flaws, but the overall experience damn rocks. That love for all those details. Like at some point there is a Pianist-ghost (which you don't see usually without a skill) and beside her is a book of Kirill's (*sigh*) best songs. And you can ask her to play those. And she does. Spent like 15 minutes in that mansion just standing there and listen to Kirill's songs. That ""pet-pal""-Talent alone is worth a thumbs-up. It's so enjoyable talking to ""critters"" on a map. Getting hints, secrets or even quests. Or just ???????t nonsense :)   Pro-Hint (super tiny spoiler): Try to keep that cat alive at all costs you'll met very soon into the game ,-)  If you love RPG, like or can endure turn-based, there's no way around this one. GET IT. If you dislike RPG or turn-based: stay the heck away. This is not the droid you're looking for.   The good (what to love):  Play as one of the ""origin""-characters. With their own complete backstory. Which is highly recommended for your first playthrough. But you can still customize your character completly.  Graphics are really neat  SFX/Music is really great. Sadly no more new (obviously) tracks from Kirill. RIP man!  You can talk with animals. One of the coolest features ever in an RPG. Meet snobby cats, cynical crabs, hopelessly positive dogs, etc. Not only for fun, but also for quests, hints, secrets or for pure distracting amusement...Awesome feature!  MODS! The best thing a game could have. You don't like a particular feature? Get a mod. There is none? Make one. Every game should have that. PERIOD. This is and often was the distinct feature that seperated pretty good from AWESOME and long-lasting games.  Completely voiced, not one sentence is not spoken. I know, many people don't care, but it doesn't hurt either, does it? I personally like it for added immersion.  No bugs/crashed so far. After two complete playthroughs at the moment of this review. Not even a misaligned texture.  Often many ways to solve a problem. For example getting of the first island there are around 11 (right?) different ways to do that. Sure, most are pretty similar and end in more or less the same result, but as I often say: it's a game and not reality. Impossible to give you REAL freedom. It still feels like YOU chose the results.   Many actions DO have consequences. Some minor, some major.   Well done turn-based. From my noobish-PoV though. Fights are fun and can range from relaxing to OMFG-WHAT-HAVE-I-DONE.  Comparatively short loading-times. Once a map loaded, you instantly(!) switch areas (like to a cave or whatever else transition). VERY MUCH appreciated. Nothing kills immersion more than stupid 1-minute ""LOADING...""-screen. In and out of a cave in not a second. Yeah, great, thanks!  Tiny details like being able to make notes on the map. VERY helpful if you discover something that you MIGHT be able to solve/do/pickup/catch later.  You can specialize all of your companions upon you first meet them. Great detail! Like one of the characters but don't need their supposed role? Fine, change it. No problem.  End of Act 1, when you finally got a grip of things and how this crap works, you will get your option to RESPEC every character completely (including apprerance). YES! I love that. Some of us gamers don't want to put hundreds of hours into ONE game and multiple walkthroughs and be more efficient in JUST ONE walkthrough. Thanks for that. If you hate a feature like that, you don't HAVE to use it. The mediocre (not good, not bad, but no show-stopper either):  Some schools/talents/skills are somehow pointless and you will never use them. Good idea, bad execution  Some ambient chatter become VERY annoying VERY quickly when you're e.g. shopping near and micro-managing equipment. Damn stupid NPCs :-)  From time to time it doesn't really seem to matter much how you're playing (be the nice guy or the sociopathic arsewipe). Some or most encounters are bound to happen anyway either way. But well this is a game and not the real world, it's impossible to be prepared for everything :)  VERY high replayability (not a PRO for people with not much sparetime for gaming). Many ways to complete quests, enough people to form a party and hence change the quests/suprises/sidequests. This might be a big plus if you have much time at your hands.  If you hate micromanagement you might even be a lil frustrated at the lowest difficulty. You will have to manage gear, skills, talents and spells for four characters nearly every 5 meters when you've found a new thing. Lower difficulties are very forgiving though. But can still challenge you if you have zero idea of what's going on. But if everything's too much for you there are still MODS or even cheats.   No real Set-items. Well on the first Island there is a set. But not wearing the complete set curses you and by the time you'll have it complete it's of no use at all. And there isn't even a set-bonus. Reducing this to a boring errand for the completionist. The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):  Items rarely really feel unique or great. Found a ""legendary""? Yeah well, walk 10meters and you'll find the next better one. Plus most non-""unique""-items are random which often results in horribly sucky items. Intelligence-requireing pants with +X strength. Strength-requirement-ring with +X Intelligence and some mage-stats. Yeah great. For selling. Boring. For example the first SET: Great to aquire. Requires lot of work/details. But you'll end up selling that stuff for some coins before even completing it to WEAR it. Meh, VERY unsatisfying.   SOMETIMES it can be hard to even spot your enemies in between turns due to all those status-effects on the screen. Could be worse, but could definately be better.  If you play on higher difficulties you might find some schools/classes/character-combinations pretty useless/unfair. That MIGHT kill it for you. But balancing a complex RPG like this perfectly is pretty much impossible to admit. No excuse? You're to judge...  Crafting sucks. No filtering, no sorting and you learn new recipes every few meters. But I failed to find the need to craft anything besides runes anyway. Recommended?  If you can wrap your head around turn-based and like RPGs? YESYESYESYESYES! Don't hesitate. Even if you don't much like top-down games. You'll quickly forget that (I usually prefer 1st-Person). This is one beautifully crafted gem, with love for details. I'd name it the Witcher-Series of turn-based-isometric-RPGs. And I'm a Witcher-Lover."

You can't even taunt targets without stripping them of all their armor points first. Magic is extremely difficult to use without risking friendly fire. Some of the fights are extremely poorly designed (ship fight between Acts 1 and 2, I'm looking at you) and the devs love to 'gotcha' by introducing enemies and elements into combat you couldn't have known about before starting the engagement (much save / reload and trial / error required).     The illusion of choice is also especially bad. Basically you have the way the developers want you to solve the problem and then all the wrong ways. Feel free to select the wrong way if you want things to be more difficult. On top of those things I found the story to be an extremely typical 'you are the chosen one and only you can save the universe' tale. Some very eye rolling fondling over your character really turned me off of the plot. The individual character stories are more interesting but only make up a tiny percentage of what you'll spend your time doing - which is mostly wandering around large environments looting barrels and managing your inventory.    Some final notes. Crafting is a chore but at least it's completely ignorable. There's a ton of things to read but most of that is also easily ignored. You will likely feel compelled to play one of the 'origin' characters instead of making a custom character because you miss out on content if you don't. Graphics and sounds are fine but nothing really stands out as outstanding. The entire game is voice acted which is great, although that voice acting is just serviceable. Lastly this is an incredibly long game, which I suppose means good value to some but to me means bloat and poor pacing. Divinity lost me in Act 2, which is about half way through, and I can't see myself playing another 40-50 hours of this."

It's a game about status effects and power combos and enemies with a whole lot of hit points.  The game doesn't reward you for clever combinations; those combinations are mandatory to succeed.  There are not enough fights to test the combos, either, so there is no learning as you go. Also, be preparing to scrap your first go at the game. Apparently, you can easily create a party that will not be able to succeed. I hear that the game gets easier but I'm not sure if I want to overcome the horrible experience I've had so far to find out."
205,Kickass,64,5,0,2017-10-02,Not Recommended,163.1,"I hope there was a neutral button for this game.  It could be  a ????ing epic game, however at this moment, I can tell u it's not. I really enjoy its story line, but the longer u have played, the more frustrated and angier u have gotten, because this game is containing a serious bug with missions, which caused your mission abort. I have wasted my half of the playing time because of it.  Pros: 1.******Great story******* 2.Nice Sound track 3.Mission rich 4.Outstanding combat style  Cons: 1. Missions bug, u couldn't finish the missions because of the missing dialogues' bugs. I encountered 8 mission bugs in driftwood (around 40 missions right there, 1/5 of the missions were abort at that time.), 6 in the Arya and 2 are about the main quests ( but lucky I could solve main story one by reloading the save.).  *** Really annoying*** u have to visit the game wiki online while playing this game, otherwise u got stuck. Save and reload couldn't fix the problem, even I restart the mission, the bug still caused your trouble. Thus, I had created 3 characters, one of them were deleted because of this ????ing bug, another one's  for the experiment.  2.Dialogue/ sound suddenly went off. It could be another bug and need to be fix.  3.If you have ever played Fallout 4, then u are going to find out the same problem - Stupid dialogue option (not all of them, but it's around 40%), it usually lead to the same following dialogue whatever u have choosen differently.  For example, I was playing a male character, and there's a male npc blocking your way to enter the campus. At this moment, u had 4 choices( killing, persuasion, ***sexal attraction*** and leaving.) and I choosed the sexal attraction and it 's a success, but he described your male character as a female in the following dialogue, I tried this conversation with a female character and I got the same result. I am not sure it's a bug or not, so I gave another test with this npc ( High v.s. low persuasion), both of my characters still got the good result regardless the persuasion level.  4.Bugs on the buff states on your characters and allies. For example, a conjurer used a 2-turn damage buff on his pet.  1st turn: Pet action ended -> Conjurer used a 2 turns damage buff on his pet -> Turn end 2nd trun: Pet with dmg buff action ended -> dmg buff lost -> Conjurer turn -> Turn end Another example, u were attacked and got a burnning state by enemy. 1st turn: Hero action ended -> Enemy attacked your hero with fire ball -> U got a burning state (2 turns)  because of defeated magic armor -> Turn end 2nd trun: Hero action ended -> Hero burning state ( 1 turn) -> enemy turn -> Turn end 3rd turn: Hero action end -> Hero burning state lost -> ... There's the problem with the state turn counting between the + and - ve effect, + ve state last shorter than expected, hopefully, this is just a bug.  4. There's no difference on the enemy using charm / tanut skill, both skills cause your ally attack u. Charm- Causing your enemy attack his allies Taunt- Causing your enemy attack focus on u however, A taunted ally always choosed a high damage range skill or bomb to attack,  he wasn't focus on the enermy at all but on other heroes and dueling tons of damage on allies at that time. What a ????ing joke!  5. Charm skill is?????? charmed enemy didn't do anything but walking around ( >50% time).  6. ????ing stupid tags, different tags give different special dialogues, but only mystic and scholar tags are useful on the mission and u must have those 2 tags on the same chararcters to some missions. If u don't have a character with mystic and scholar tags at the same time, few missions u are going to miss or unsolve (only 1 or 2 can have an alternative way.). Two characters, who have mystic and scholar tags individually, couldn't solve the quest together, because u need a character with both tags. As a result, I have to build every character with those tags in each game.  What a regret on this game! I really wanted to recommend this game, but the mission dialogue bugs cause me wasting 50% of the gaming time, so I do not recomment this game at this moment, even it has a real ????ing nice story. Unless there is a patch to fix the bug in the future, then I will recommend it."

It seems like every single enemy is capable of range attacks, area attacks and teleporting around the battlefield.  Every battelfield is littered with oil, fire, ice, poison, etc so that you can't take a single step without taking additional damage.  Why is does every single range skill have splash damage and alter the battelfield. You have to laugh at a game that gives you a half a dozen resurrection scrolls by level 2, because you know it's going to be a struggle.  The fights aren't impossible it's just that after 45 hours I'm at level 8 and that's half the time spent at mastering and completing games like Skyrim, Dragon Age, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate.  As an experienced RPG lover I find it insulting to drop the diffculty to easy just to playthrough.  And normal difficulty is too much so I guess this game isn't for me.

They took what was already the most flexible, fun, and modern CRPG out there and made the engine even more expansive and the game weirder and more interesting.  I would actually recommend playing the first one first if you haven't; it's not really needed for plot reasons (there are a few returning characters but nothing major) but it's a little easier to get a handle on, hardly any less impressive, and in the meantime this sequel could probably still use another few months of polish patches. It's hardly anything to hold against it given the scope, and I didn't hit a single bug I'd consider really significant, but the farther you get into the game the more broken the quest flags start to feel and the more minor continuity issues the dialogue starts to have and the more combat balance starts to break. This is all after like 30+ hours, mind you (I'm up to 50 and not quite done yet, which is unheard of for me)."

There are only two things you need to know about Divinity: Original Sin 2.  First, within one week of launch it became the highest-rated games of all time on Metacritic (it currently has a metascore of 95).  Second, all of that critical acclaim is completely deserved.  You see, a very long time ago there was a game called Baldur's Gate 2. It was incredible. An enormous CRPG with engaging combat, compelling characters, and an intriguiing narrative. It demonstrated just how good a roleplaying game could be, and established a standard of quality that would cast a shadow over every subsequent CRPG for decades. For a very long time, we convinved ourselves that Baldur's Gate 2 was an outlier. An abberation. That we would never see another game of similar scope, scale or quality again. And that we were wrong to expect such grand ambitions from even our most beloved of developers.  But we were wrong.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is the game we have been waiting for. It is a spectacular, transcendental experience.

This game is about as close to DND on a digital medium that you can get while still being its own game. Fully interactive environment, (tons of fire, electricuting water, exploding oil and poison) and the developers really played with it.  Just a small spoiler alert, but to just put it in perspective how the environment comes into play. There's one fight pretty far into the game on top of a mountain of wreckage. Out of absolutely nowhere, tons of oily blobs come to kill you. Every time you damage them, and they move, they spread oil. So the whole time, you're trying to batter them down as you move up the mountain to get away from them. The dev's then have it to where when the oily guys finally go down, TONS of fire guys show up and ignite all the oil. I know its kinda hard to get it across, but fighting ontop of this giant mound with fire everywhere trying to batter down the fiery slimes, seriously felt cool.   Character creation wise, I mean it's pretty good. Not a ton of customization, just standard face 1, 2, 3, etc. But honestly not a big deal. As you develop what your character is good at, you grow to love em.  Classes are pointless, you build your character the way YOU want to, so they can literally become anything. I've got a few characters going, and all feel super unique and diverse. A dwarven rogue shapeshifter who can grow a tentacle arm and smack people around as well as shed all enemies magical resistances to support, I've got a fire slinging geomancer who uses oil??????to explode just about everyone, and I've got a necromancer archer who summons tons of undead corpses to explode all over people. It all feels super unique and fun to play. There's times where I miss my other characters, hop on them to play, and then miss the one I was just playing. Kinda neat.  If you want my advice, 100+ hours advice, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. Preferrably in person. Hit up an old school lan party feel, bring cpu's over, build a SUPER diverse cast of characters, and hunker down. Pizza and beer obviously. Plan for an all nighter, because I literally PROMISE you you'll be playing til 6am EASY.

42,Ventus,269,16,1,2017-10-03,Not Recommended,494.2,"Like the others, too many RPG/Game busting bugs. Wait for Enhanced Edition/Sale/More patches. This game is bugged from beginning to the final quest (serious, story broken ending bugs, plenty of reporting on forums if you want to ruin it for youself, but I recommend avoiding for a while).  My final conclusion is to wait for a heavy discount and more patches to fix broken/bad content.   My gameplay hours trump most (despite being inflated by afking with game running) but i've stuck it out and tried to report as many bugs as possible. Simply put this is great game potential, yet mared by bugs everywhere (for a metric, patch 3 addressed over 100 features and bugs alone, many of which were known for months of early access). This makes the game, as it stands, very hard to enjoy as you don't know what is bugged and what is a feature. Moreover, quests, despite being completed correctly, still flag as incomplete (and thus the game treats you as having not done the stuff you did) and this alone is tire screeching for any RPG.   Features are generally much the same as D:OS1 but again they feel like beta or just bad in some areas, and splendid in others. Dialogue and Banter chat log feature has never once functioned to date. Some fights in game warrant explaination on wtf Larian was thinking (Dreamers Portal) and most of the status and features require trail and error to get a grasp of (Ring: 6 Vitality apparently means 'this ring gives you constant healing equal to the HP from 7 constitution (and each point of constitution give 7% vitality, which are your Hit Points). Personal preferences aside, quite a number of 'intended features' are either frustrating (not being able to mouse over enemy debuffs to read description) or simply are broken/never made it into the game. There is a good deal number of dialogues that are only partly voiced, meaning that its either more bugs (not playing voice script properly) or intended that way.  Another Example: The quest log (arguably important) is poorly implimented. Supposing you avoid the bugged logs, it doesn't fully complete for each zone. It also updates per interaction (so if you find a boss, then later find a note hinting where the boss is, the note will be the top update). This results in you not knowing if the quest if still in your current Act (and thus you will miss out if you leave) or if the quest is continued in the next act. Its guessing game or risk forum spoilers."
53,bruticus0,12,15,0,2017-10-03,Not Recommended,123.9,"We've run into a game breaking bug.  After all the patches we've been through, a game breaking bug shouldn't be present.  My wife and I both have the game.  Our inventories have become messed up we think.  The only indicators we have are five blank spots when we go to Crafting inventory.  We have even tracked down where they come from.    During Driftwood, you have a quest, Strange Cargo, to rescue a guy in a barrel.  The moment you tell him to come with you, he becomes part of your party.  In his inventory are five grenade items.  No matter what you do after that, you will have blank spaces in your Crafting inventory.  Whether you kill him on the spot, or lead him safely out of town.  You might wonder what a few missing spots would matter.  As did we.  But when you get ready to leave Act2 and go to Nameless Isle, you'll either get kicked back out to the main menu during the cutscene, or get Crash to Desktop.  If you get kicked back out, it gives Save Error 302.  We haven't been able to get any attention on the issue.  But I suspect more people may realize having the same problem as time goes on and people progress through the story.  And they'll probably lose three days worth of progress like we did, and really really not even want to finish the game anymore.  So until this is fixed, or maybe even if it does, there's gonna be at least two negative reviews on this game from us."
149,maats,113,6,2,2017-10-03,Not Recommended,181.4,"First let me say I played Divinity Original Sin through twice. I loved that game. So naturally I was looking forward to DOS2. Admittedly both games have alot in common but not everything. The big exception seems to be play balance. The play balance in the classic mode of DOS was nearly perfect and I played the entire gamne through in that mode. Classic mode wasn't so easy it would be boring and just difficult enough so you had to be careful about your strategy or suffer death. Not so with DOS2.   I started playing in classic mode at Fort Joy and found it challanging but not impossible. However after heading to Reapers Cove it became impossible to beat any mob unless there was some trick to it that permitted me to beat them without fighting. Each mob was at least two levels above me and they always got to attack first. Worse each member of the mob would have three or four moves even before I was able to attack. So with an mob of 4 guys they would make up to 12- 16 moves BEFORE I could even attack. Bythat time each of my guys would be low on armor, frozen, diseased, poisoned outflanked etc. That automatically put me in a defensive mode to heal armor and/or health points which meant I wasn't hitting back. When I was able to hit back my attacks did far less damage to them than they did to me. This doesn't include them using spells on me that weren't available for purchase or too expensive to buy.  So I figured I try playing in story mode which is so easy I could probably take on a voidwoken with a toothbrush and win.   I don't know what the developers did to screw up the game balance but it's not longer fun to play in either story or classic mode. I don't want to give it a thumbs down becasue I'm  going to play in story mode to gain a few levels to even things out and then go back to classic mode to see if there's a difference. But I can't give it a thumbs up either because things might end up just as unbalanced when I switch back to classic mode. Since I have to choose one or the other I have to give it a thumbs down based on my experience so far. Hopefully all will be well if I level a couple of times but I'm not keeping my fingers crossed.  Ok, heres a second take on DOS II. The game is buggy, and not in a minor way. For example the pipe puzzle quest doesn't work. Nothing flows into the pipe channels when I press the control tiles. I was able to get around it somewhat by standing at the right or left corner of the control panel and placing a transport pyramid on the other side of the barrier (I'm sure that's a bug too). Then I transported down to where the three valves are and manually turned them. That got the holy elements flowing into the channels.  Unfortunately they don't flow in the correct direction when I move the control tiles. I hate this. This is a game stopper inasmuch to the best of my knowledge I need to finish this in order to continue the main quest.  IMO there's no excuse for this. When the smaller quests are bugged it's irritating but I can get around them. But now I can't advance in a game I shelled out $40 for.  What a joke."
252,sithicus,291,5,0,2017-10-03,Not Recommended,138.3,"This game would be a 10/10 for me. Ultimately I have to give it a negative review for now. On several occasions I have saved the game (I save often due to the difficulty of even Classic mode as well as my impending comment) and when I go to load the game because of a party wipe or NPC's die in combat that I'm trying to keep alive for quest purposes, the game crashes on trying to load that specific save file. Due to the nature of the autosave frequency, it could set you back quite a ways in the game by having to go back to a stable save.  As I said this has happened about a dozen times in the 50 hours I have lovingly poured into this game. And don't get me wrong, it's a FANTASTIC game, a vast improvement over the first DOS, but for the sake of your sanity in grieving over a corrupt save file, wait to pick this up until the dev's patch it or clear up this saving issue."

509,DMD,17,5,0,2017-10-04,Recommended,399.7," 44 hours into the game, and we are just finishing act 1..  Few games gave me the same experience I'm having now with DOS2, and I don't mean the artistic, gameplay or story aspects of the game here, I'm talking about a personal feeling of satisfaction that as ""Gamers"" we are lucky to have a studio like Larian to develop such a marvel for us with such attention to details and passion for perfection, that you know from the start of the game you're going into a very special adventure.. The only game I remember that was able to deliver this personal experience and show the same level of love and dedication from its developer was the Witcher 3.  The Story (so far), the music, the voice acting, the graphics, and the world details, are all perfect.  The 6 origin characters, are very interesting to choose from and play as, each has her/his unique persona, story and quests.  Gameplay mechanics are hard but satisfying, it's a turned based tactical strategy with action points to spend each turn (xcom style), with a big number of varied abilities, skills and talents to learn, build, use and combo.  Quest tracking and inagme journal can be a bit confusing though, and might force you to miss some details on some quests, I don't consider that as a bad thing in principle, as it encourages you to keep checking the journal regularly, to find out and explore or even miss things on your own, but I would like to see some improvements on it in future patches.  The camera is inconvenient sometimes, it can be hard to spot enemies on higher grounds and the ones who are blocked or standing behind other characters.  It's hard to justify why some of the AOE skills are still affected by the miss chance, since most of them are still resisted by magical and physical armor anyway.  Now, one of the best parts about playing DOS2 for me is the co-op mode, that's why i mentioned We at the beginning, I was lucky enough to have a friend who was interested in the game, and agreed to start the story with me, and since then we are having a blast, and enjoying the game together.  Playing in co-op provides you with a totally different experience, which adds to an already amazing game, I honestly think everyone should give it a try..  I mean: discussing the choices we have been offered in some conversation with a random rat, that we were able to speak to using one of our characters talent.. Asking my friend to use one of his character's flying skills to reach places my characters can't.. My friend asking me to buy him a skill book he found interesting, since I've invested some points in the barter ability which improve my trading skill, therefor I can buy items for cheaper prices than him..  Doing silly stuff that cause us to lose the fight like miss-clicking the wrong area, or healing my friend's rogue main character without noticing that she has the Decay debuff which damages her instead, laughing at our mistakes and then reload..  Those are some of the things that make co-op a great feature in the game, and all you need to enjoy it, is the in-gam"
594,Wonder Llama,205,3,0,2017-10-04,Recommended,271.1,"This is possibly one of the first times I've really stopped to review a game in any thoughtful manner. I'm not one for doing so, or for commenting in public in general. That in itself should tell you something about the sheer brilliance of this game.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is quite possibly one of the best games ever created, or at the very least one of the best RPGs ever made. Never before have I been so sucked in, so compelled by a game and its story, lore, and characters.  One of the first things you'll notice about DOS2 is the atmosphere. The musical cues, the environment, the feel of ever-present danger, a truly epic quest, and of course, the soundtrack. My god, the soundtrack.  Combat is innovative and feels really good. With an 'open-class' concept and enough spells and abilities, you can make just about any kind of character you could imagine. From a blood-sucking witch that dabbles in lightning to a sturdy warrior with a healing spell or two. And more notably, many of these spells can be combined with either others or the environment to create incredible effects. Toss a fireball into a pit of poison to make it explode into flames, or shock a pool of blood or water to possibly stun everyone caught within.  The game is hard at times, surely. Even on the easiest difficulty (which honestly can be -too- easy sometimes), you'll have to have to really think about the battlefield conditions. Honour mode especially gets mention; brutal, wonderfully intense combat mixed with your basic ironman mode. Wipe your whole party and its game over with a single save.  Finally, it's the story that truly shines in this game. I've played a -lot- of games in my day, but hands-down DOS2 is one of the single most powerful games I've played. The main story is sturdy enough to stand on its own and only gets better as you venture onward, and especially the last few hours will have you questioning everything. Your companions, who take the form of the other origins stories you don't pick at the start, have rich storylines each with a very nice twist. The voice acting is excellent, as is the narration, and the ability to romance one of your companions later in the story makes for a pleasant little plot point.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an incredible game, and you can tell Larian took their time to create a masterpiece. They succeeded. I can't see myself putting it down anytime soon. Fans of oldschool-esque RPGs with heavy emphasis on story, rejoice. Our savior has finally come."

13,Voile,169,63,0,2017-10-04,Not Recommended,91.6,"In short: wait to buy the game until several patches from now. Maybe six months. Maybe until an enhanced edition comes out.   In long: If you played the first game, this one is a bit of a disappointment. There were some questionable gameplay design changes. The institution of the armour system is not ideal, to say the least, and the streamlining of the stat system loses more than it makes up in ease of use. I think other people have explained it better than I can, so I'll sum it up: physical/magical armour prevents any damage or status effects, from any source, be it directly applied or environmental. Defence abilities such as willpower that would protect against certain types of status afflictions from the last game have been removed. Certain attribute stats, such as speed, have also been removed. The dynamic action point system of the last game has been removed. Skills from the last game, copy+pasted in description and effect, suddenly have a higher cost requirement (that enemy NPCs often don't have to pay.)  All of these changes have the sum of making the combat much more constricted and much less dynamic, and many times, means one fight to another is virtually identical. I personally wouldn't consider that to be a positive nor negative, if not for one thing: enemies have none of the same restrictions as you. Enemies lack cooldowns and have universal access to skills you don't. Enemies can create surfaces and status afflictions (like cursed surfaces, acid, plague) that entirely ignore your armour. Enemies have more action points than you, and they have a higher max action point threshold. Every enemy has a teleport ability, some can use every turn, AND they have a farther range than you, so some fights consist of using all your action points to run up to an enemy, only for them to teleport/run farther away than you can run, then casting something at you. Enemies have a large amount of free movement, and many skills cost less AP for them alone. In most fights, enemies start in the most advantageous positions possible, if you're trying to do the quests in the order they're intended to be done. Oh, also, all enemies are psychic on every difficulty level. If you're an undead, even if you're hiding your identity, expect to be healed, which will do a good amount of damage to you. If someone uses the permafrost skill, which makes you immune to damage (except when it doesn't, because some enemies can still damage you with certain skills, which isn't mentioned in the skill description,) and heals you for any damage taken, all enemies will ignore the character with the permafrost effect. If a character has a higher weakness to a certain damage type than another, all enemies will focus on that damage type. Expect to say, several times, ""That's cheating!""  I don't mean to say the game is hard. It's not, really, which is fine by my standards. But these systems have not been studied, and so it's glaring and annoying when unintended consequences happen. One such unintended consequence: only one or two skill trees are valid above certain thresholds, IF, and I mean if, bugs haven't severely limited their usefulness. The way the system is designed, all magic damage, as it is elemental, stands a chance of healing the enemy, and as physical/magical armour is divided, an effective team should use one and not the other to avoid chipping away at two different healthpools with no overlap. Physical damage cannot be resisted nor healed. Melee characters must spend valuable action points to get into melee, and all enemies are equipped with a cooldown-less teleport, so this is inefficient. The inequality between different skill trees and builds becomes unavoidable and especially annoying end game.  I'm also not a big fan of the borderlands-esque entirely randomised, no exceptions loot system. In an RPG, if my character is given a weapon that is supposedly designed to kill a god, I'd expect it to not be a sidegrade for this pitchfork I found in a lucky wooden box a few minutes ago. I get testy when all my strength-based gear gives me intelligence points.  Oof. End game. Let's jump there. I'm not wholly sure the developers fully beta tested or bug fixed the entire second half of the game, if they did at all. Certain higher level skills literally, literally do not work; netherswap, one of the rare teleports in the game, generates line of sight errors no matter what. No matter what. You cannot use the skill at the moment of writing this because no matter where or what you're teleporting, you can't see it. My character with netherswap, apparently, couldn't see herself to teleport herself.  Okay, so that's combat gameplay. It doesn't end there. Certain quests cannot start, nor finish, depending on the order of your dialogue choices. I do not mean ""I'll gouge your eyes out"" dialogue choices. A quest in the last zone doesn't start if you ask a woman if she's doing ok before you ask about her missing husband. Another quest in the last zone doesn't start if you happened to read a certain book before talking to a quest relevant NPC. You'd think your character might care to mention, perhaps, this NPC is about to be murdered by this other NPC. No such luck.   Bigger bugs are still in the game, too. Certain circumstances can suddenly make your characters unable to interact with objects or talk to NPCs. Essential NPCs will disappear entirely from your map. Saves still get permanently corrupted. Unintentionally unkillable enemy mobs. Don't play multiplayer: more bugs.  Back to quests- your journal often doesn't update with recent quest progress, or it updates inaccurately, saying you did things you didn't, or didn't do things you did. At one point my quest told me my romantically entangled companion betrayed me and tried to end the world. Bit of a mixup, that. Even NPCs get confused and will talk to you as if you picked options you did not. This gets bothersome when the NPCs are so enraged by the actions you didn't take that they try to kill you.  Many quests will never close or resolve unless you kill one of the quest essential characters, thus never giving you a reward. God forbid you move onto the next area, because that will close your quest and then will say you ignored it/abandoned it and assume you did the worst things possible.  Actually, I don't know what's worse. When leaving resolves the quest negatively, or when the quest never resolves, staying open and unresolved through the literal epilogue. I had two quests from act 2 do that.   Even if the combat design stayed true to the first game, and the bugs got swept up, if you enjoyed the RPG elements of the first game, you're going to be a bit disappointed in DOS2. Many quests give no choices, though imply there should be more than one, and if you choose to follow the quest, you'll find NPCs become furious with you for being forced to pick the only resolution available. The main quest mandates a course of action in the first act that will immediately make half of the NPCs on the map hostile on sight to you. The main quest often mandates, then makes unavoidable, incredibly unethical or stupid mechanics/decision chains that will prevent progress if you refuse. You're going to be eating people's souls and consigning them to oblivion whether you want to or not, bub. You were a FOOL for not seeing the big bad's super evil ambush, and you were a FOOL for doing nothing even if you saw it a mile away, because they somehow got into an area they couldn't have gotten into, and suddenly you're knocked down and immobilised and the big bad got away, you idiot.  NPCs will gank-dialogue characters at random. Hope you didn't invest in persuasion on your main character.  I still had fun. Just too much annoyance, for a 45 USD game."

I was challanging and do able on classic. Once I got to the 2nd act however, I quickly lost interest. The enemies stats scale ridiculously campared to your own. It kinda feels unfair.

It seems at first glance that the graphic quality coupled with the RPG action would be enough to sate desires, but as an avid player of Neverwinter Nights 1(CD not the online or NW2) I can say there is no reward in playing this game. It doesnt feel fun and engaging like NWN1 or any other game ive played over the last 15 years. Turn based gameplay is outdated especially when you can afford to include more freedom of movement during fights and when you restrict that movement at its most vital essence (the combat) the rest of the game begins to lack significantly . Ive played roughly 17 hours of this have failed to get into it. Why is it I can look online and find a story driven RPG more worthwile in action combat dated 2002 for free when this game retails for $40 and fails to suit my RPG needs."

The depth is awesome, this is really the first game of this specific genre I have played, and I'm glad I took the risk on it. Incredibly immersing enviroments, music, story and characters. You really feel part of this world. Combat is very deep and I actually restarted the game twice before I was happy enough with my build and companions. Takes a bit of time if you are new to this series to get used to how classes and roles work, and how you should be building your team, but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly straightforward. The only negative I felt was that the journal gave a lack of direction on quests and objectives in general, but as soon as you stop treating them like quests and more like parts of a dynamic story it doesn't really matter. You can fail some, or do things wrong and that's okay it's part of your story. Often doing the wrong thing can get you some nice loot or information that helps you in some other way. Love it."

I found the first game much too difficult and complex. I then got the Enhanced Edition and recently (about a few weeks ago) got into it as I read the description and apparently you could change the mode. I chose Explorer. Still didn't invest enough time to get very far.  October 5, 2017I finally got this game, started it up, and was bombarded with numerous and amazing features. For example, the ability to choose Origin characters or create your own. There were more class-types and the environment was spectacular! This is the best looking game I've ever played.  To the rest of the game; I've played numerous times, only escaping Reaper Isles once but not even going farther than that. I've played as one Origin character in a party and an undead human conjurer as a lone wolf. Now I'm an Origin character lone wolf and am STILL having fun.  I am still finding new things throughout my few playthroughs, like the cat familiar. :D I find it amazing how you can summon a cat, them jump up to unreachable places and you can swap places with it. I also found a lot of other unique treasures and hidden places around Fort Joy and I enjoy finding them.  I am in love with Divinity: Original Sin 2. The price tag may be high, but the gameplay, content, and immersion is amazing! Brace yourselves too, it's a narrative game. -wink-"
1878,pinkpinnn,248,2,0,2017-10-05,Recommended,122.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 - 2017 GEM.  Finding a game that mixes RPG, D&D, customizable class/ characters, good story telling, beautiful aesthetics, crafting system, tactical turn based battle, and option to play co-op? This game pretty much offers it all up on a silver plate.  I've played the first Divinity Original Sin, and my impression of that wasn't so strong, however I decided to give this a try, and it definitely floored me.  None too many games I've played have done a swell job in buffing lores, stories, and open ended quests for you to explore. You don't have to be a lore-lover or a rouge type gamer to enjoy this. There's a sweet spot for everyone. I went looking for a plain old adventure-with-consequences game, and spent more time reading up short lores here and there instead of speeding through it.  I can't believe I've spent 80+ hours (solo play) and still haven't completed it yet. Actually for the first chapter, I managed to spend 8-9 hours (and this was just purely exploring and figuring out quests). Halfway through the game, it even conjured up my nostalgia for Dragon Age 1.   CONS/ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  -Sometimes there are NO warnings before huge consequences take place. And when it happens, it's too late to alter (unless you are bothered to load up a game save 1 hour ago+). This happened a few times for me, the most painful one for me being: I couldn't take my companions to the next chapter because I'd missed that one window to convince them. They were absolutely gone. I loaded a previous save, but ever since that happened, I ended up tracking quests on wikia instead in fear of a major slip up -Quest journals are sometimes vague, and you will be left wondering or wiki-ing what the next step should be -Some quests feel un-finished or un-polished, as there may only be ONE, OBSCURE way of completing it -Not a must, but nice to have: Camera angle needs more rotation flexibility -No option to hide the HUD  PROS:  -The battle system constantly makes you look for the best spots to prepare and engage. Whenever you think you've got your ""go-to"" strategies nailed down, the game manages to switch it up just a little to make it challenging (+fun) again -Attention to detail towards the environment and the overall atmosphere. I don't always stop and look at the shadows of leaves and trees in a game. Each chapter is a map with it's own characteristics -Memorable background sound and music <3 Well done Borislav Slavov  -EVERY character has a voice! And voice acting is just ace -Main companions have decent back stories, although 1 or 2 still seem like pompous ?????????s after 20 hours -HIGH replayability value -Co-op offers extra fun if you want play with you rmates, and most things work smoothly. Just take note of the connectivity menu, and make sure to set your game privacy, as random people can enter your game and hijack your acharacter completely. -Dungeon master mode! For those who are into D&D this might be an interesting mode to check out  TO THINK THIS GAME WAS BACKED BY A KICK STARTER AND DEVELOPED + LAUNCHED UNDER 3 YEARS!  It's not easy balancing and taking in multiple opinions and ideas and delivering on something this decent. I suspect good team work somewhere in Larian Studios. The game is decent enough for me to overlook the annoying flaws (for now). And major game developing companies? You guys better brush up your A game. Top notch graphics aren't the only thing that makes a game immersive and great.  ANYWAYS...JUST...Just ..go play it!"

310,NanoByteGhost,354,7,0,2017-10-05,Not Recommended,111.9,"I have now finished this game and have rewriten this review.   I have included some tips to help you finish this game if you really want to buy it. There are some things the game just throws at you suddenly that will end your game if your not prepared.   They labeled this game an RPG when in reality its more of a squad combat game with upgrades. Focus on that and you will understand the game better.    Role Play options are very limited. The game really does not have much support for geninue role play and the support that does exist, really does not do much. It is all about earning experience to upgrade your characters for the next fight.   The characters background stories are weak and uninteresting, the main plot never really grabbed me.   I got the impression the game was designed before the story and they wrote the story to try and encompose all the fights the game designers had created.   There are for example nearly a dozen bad guys, not of which have any explainable link to each other during the game but get thrown together right at the end without any real explanation.   Many players who have finished the game consider the ending to be a disappointment and honestly, if your expecting a good story, your going to find it disappointing too.   Its a squad based combat game, plain and simple.   With that in mind, this is the core gameplay.   You fight, you earn experience points which eventually leads to you leveling up. At that time you get awarded points that can be spent improving your character.   I found it useful not to spend all these points right away due to the games ""One way to do some stuff"" problem.   Each area you explore is filled with bad guys which you have to kill, once dead they do not respawn. The experience you earned killing them is the only experience your going to get from them. So make the most of it.   If you can get 1 level higher than the bad guys your fighting, then the game is much easier, if your equal or even lower in level than the guys your fighting, its very hard.   What characters you choose for your party may appear to be a free choice on your part but its not. That is an illusion because this game needs you to have certain things in your party to stop you either dying a lot or just not being able to process past some quests.   Without a Mage in your party for example every single fight is like a BOSS fight.   Makes are like EASY MODE on Hard difficulty. Explorer difficulty is what most games would call ""Very hard"" difficulty.   With a mage in your party things get slightly easier and you manage to avoid most of the games bad habits.  The developers favourite trick is putting you up against impossible odds that you cannot win without playing the system, eg abusing fast travel to heal, reloading saved games when a spell does not work as intended, so you can try again.   There are no easy fights in this game, in fact most fights are extraordinarily hard.   Especially if you do not have a mage in your party.   AIs at your level typically (not always) have twice as much health, twice as much armour and twice as much magic armour than you. They also seem to have far better spells to cast at you.   Source which is used to power the most powerful spells, just seems to be sucked out of you and used to power the AIs most powerful spells. So having any source on you, is like giving the AI ammo to shoot you with.   So imagine what an insane idea it would be if you had unlimited source for spells.... That would seriously suck when the AI pretty much uses your own source to kill your entire party over and over again.   Thats not rhetorical btw....  Stun, freeze, charm and shock are all spells that cause you to miss a turn, you will spend most of your game watching your characters being slowly killed without you ever getting a turn because of these. A mage helps defend against these but they still happen and are far too common in this game.  It makes fights boring.  Some people consider Teleport to be optional, but there are many locations in this game where you simply cannot proceed without it.  Blood rain or any pool of blood is also needed at one point so if your a solo character without blood rain, you game will end pretty abruptly.  Also developing your characters relationships in game is important because if they are not best buddies, you will lose some of them at a certain point in the game and that party you worked so hard on for 3 acts, will just no longer exist and it happen without fight or any choice on your party.   The game makes the same mistake Divinity 1, Pillars and Wasteland all made, they make every battle very very hard unless you stumble across the right party combination and spell combination, then the game becomes easier.  RPGs of old scaled well with difficulty, this game does not, its 24/7 hard hard hard.    If you want to try something different, you will probably find the game kicks your????? at several points and stops you progressing. Though this game is less prone to that than Divinity 1 was.  Puzzles tend to be vague and badly explained, you really have to second guess the devs intentions a lot in this game. A sign of bad game design.  At certain points you have epic battles with an areas main boss, given most fights feel like boss fights, you can imagine how much harder these guys are.   So imagine reaching a point in the game, worked around all the bugs, learned the system so the game would not just end suddenly on you. Only to find your self facing every frigging bad guy you previously killed later on, not 1 at a time but all at once and this time they are level 20.   That is not rhetorical either....  You will be left with the impression the devs didnt want anybody seeing the end game which tends to reveal the games story is very very adhock nature.   If you still want to buy this game I suggest you take at least 1 mage in your party, this makes the game much easier. I also suggest you take the teleport spell, the blood rain spell and learn to use the Pyramid fast travel and map fast travel to send characters out of combat to heal during the worst fights because you will need that advantage.   You need the learn the system to beat this game, between the insane difficulty and bugs you cannot finish it without knowing how it all works or how to abuse that system.   I am sure their are cheats, god mode or what ever available but I dont know them, so I played the game as is and I can tell you without specialist knowledge, this game will last you about 110 hours first time around.   Finally save often and make it a new save, do not over write other saves because you will find you have to go back quite far some times to work around game bugs or that sudden case of ""cannot progress without something"" problem that this game has.    So, is it a good game ?  It is squad combat is good game but the battles are stupidly hard most of the time, so you end up getting more frustrated with the game than anything.   The original Divinity Original Sin was only finished by 6% of players according to steams stats during its first 2 years. The Directors cut/Enhanced version was slightly easier but still very hard.   Divinity 2 is a lot like that, most of you will never get to the end of it.  I found this game to be more frustrating then fun, it wears you do until you lose all interest in playing it. That is how most of your games will end.   I only finished it because it????????me off and I was not going to be beaten by a badly balanced game.  I think the game engine is good, the ideas in the game are good but the gameplay difficulty is stupidly hard with clearly unbalanced features common place.   Especially in combat when an AI mage hits you with 1 spell and destroys your magic armour in one go, then hits you with another spell and just kills you out right.   That happens a lot so take a lot of resurrection scrolls.   I cannot recommend this game unless you love that feeling of frustration."

So there is no suitable mode for me which really upsets me. 5) Bug: Sebilla's equipment inventory doesn't get shared items from common inventory after some time in game. 6) Have a feeling that sometimes enemies can shoot precisely through the edges of the wall/obstacle while I cannot because I am just a human. It's because AI can calculate exactly the exact place where to stand to shoot. I think that developers need to make enemies behave more like humans in this concern. 7) Frustrating diary logs. Too many records in the diary can be highlighted after some event occurs which is not good. 8) Battlefield becomes hardly visible if fire, smoke, poison are present. Especially - fire. I see that fire effects were greatly improved graphically but battlefield becomes hardly visible after all these effects. 9) Voices of NPCs are good but I have a feeling that compared to previous game they are not so distinct/clear. It's especially important for me as I am not native English speaker although I do understand English if person's voice is clear/distinct. 10) Waypoint. Why not making Waypoints links directly on the map? And why putting Waypoints menu to the main menu game? It was even better positioned in Original Sin 1. I really thought developers will implement Waypoints better in 2nd game but they did even worse.  I am really thinking now about stopping playing the game till all bugs will be fixed and users suggestions implemented."

300,Dralek,315,6,1,2017-10-06,Recommended,294.2,"This game is amazing.  I can't stop playing it.  Let's start out with the first thing you do in the game; character customization.  You have 4 races to choose from, each with their own unique traits, backstory, and affect how everyone treats you.  Lizards can dig without a shovel, Dwarves can crawl into small spaces nobody else can, Elves can eat body parts to learn the memories of the fallen (sometimes gaining skills in the process), and so forth.  You've got a lot of choices for playstyles as well, and it's not set in stone.  You could start off the game as a wizard, then transition into a battlemage who charges into the fray, then unleashes spells that require proximity.  Then, you've got the Tags.  Basically, they let you set up your own backstory, as well as giving additional dialogue options when the time is right.  Mystics can sometimes talk to the gods, whilst Barbarians want a *simple* solution to many problems.  But the best is yet to come...  and it's something that I'm a bit of a sucker for.  Music.  You can set the lead instrument on the soundtrack.  It's only four instruments, and the one you choose will be, well, the prominent instrument throughout the soundtrack.  Not a fan of character customization?  That's fine, you can select an Origin character.  These guys normally would be optional party members if you were to create your own character, but you can also play as them for your main character.  The choices are really interesting too; a lizard who cavorted with demons and got exiled, wanting to reclaim his empire; or a human who is a host of all kinds of spirits while a demon is trying to wrest control of her body.  They all have pre-set tags, but you can choose the class they start with.  Now for the gameplay.  Out of battle, stuff is simple; everything is performed from your clicking (duh).  However, even outside of combat your skills are still tested.  Persuasion can be a way to get out of a fight, or get more information out of someone, bartering lowers prices for you.  You can also steal stuff too, but be warned if you played the first game; the stealing has been revamped by quite a lot.  You can no longer just walk into someone's house, close the door and sneak about, stealing everything that isn't bolted down.  The moment you take something, no matter if you're sneaking or not, the townsfolk will become suspicious and try to search you.  Of course, there's ways to make sure they don't succeed, but I'll leave that since a lot of this game is about finding your own playstyle.  The combat is not really changed by much from the first game, but many more complexities have been added.  Surfaces play a crucial role to a mage just like before, however they have many more options due to the magic trees.  Water can be frozen, electrified, or turned into steam which can also be electrified.  Bless can actually turn surfaces, well, blessed, healing characters who travel through it.  (That includes everyone, so make sure blessed surfaces can't be accessed by the enemy.)  However, there is also Cursed surfaces, which carry extra effects to them.  Necrofire can't be put out by normal water, Cursed Oil can go off on MOVEMENT, and so forth.  Armor is no longer a stat that simply decreases damage received, it is instead its own bar.  This bar is crucial to manage, as it stops status effects.  Think of it as a shield; as long as you have a shield up, you can't be affected by the status of a surface your character may be standing on, with certain exceptions as Oil that slows you down.  As a general rule of thumb however, the game's combat is very challenging.  There really isn't many fights that have ""cannon fodder"" enemies; everyone is dangerous and they all know how to take advantage of the same things you do.  Be careful about that water you're standing on, for that mage on higher ground likely might have an electric spell he could cast, if your magic armor is down, and stun you.  My recommendation?  This game deserves all the praise that it's got and more.  The only real complaint I have is with the camera control, but that's mainly due to my mouse having issues with some games not registering the middle mouse click.  Plus, in battle you can get a top-down view if there's too many obstacles."
868,Beeps,97,122,5,2017-10-06,Not Recommended,90,"Much like the first game, Divinity Original Sin 2 is a fun game that seems to only be fun purely by accident. There's so much to unpack here that I genuinely suspect that the developers were just randomly throwing darts at a board to decide game elements--at best. At worst they were being intentionally lazy--possibly even intentionally provocative at points.  A lot of the major problems have been harped on about to the point where I dont' feel the need to mention them, but for the sake of the uninformed: the armor system in this game is entirely pass/fail, you either have armor and you resist everything or you don't and you resist nothing. The turn order is mindbogglingly terrible, working on a round robin (enemy goes then you go then enemy goes and repeat) system that seems to heavily favor the enemy. The game is literally unfinished, Act 4 was shuffled together out of planks of wood and has blatant cut corners in the form of poor scripting, low effort dialogue, low effort area design, pointless quests and voice acting that varies from being poor to simply not existing. Act 3 is not much better. Inventory management is somehow worse than the first game.   I think the best way I could describe the act of playing DOS2 is that if it feels like you are gaming the system, you are probably playing the game the way the developers intended. In someways this is what makes the game fun--I had a very similar experience with New Vegas, where playing the game on the yellowbrick road was boring as sin, but intentionally breaking the quests in ways that favored me was extremely satisfying. What makes DOS2 less satisfying than New Vegas, however, is that in DOS2, the things that break the game are things that the developers knew full well would break it. It is an intentionally asymmetrical experience. Things like teleporting enemies away from their allies and ganking them, planting explosive barrels around enemies before triggering a fight, stacking up on a certain resistance to the point where you heal from an element--these things are how the game is designed to be played.   This of course means that certain abilities are comparitively bad because they don't do key things like strip armor, reposition allies/enemies, heal, apply surfaces, etc. The top three non-source abilities in DOS2 (Which are probably: Teleportation, Shackles of Pain, Invisibility--which special mentions to Summon Bone Widow and Rain) are so unbelievably powerful that you are gimping yourself to an extreme degree if you do not use them. Balance was clearly of no concern here.  On Tactician mode, ""cheese strats"" like the ones I mentioned are so ubiquitious that I legitimately do not understand how the developers intended certain encounters to be beaten. Of particular note is one instance where I needed to save a lizardwoman from the gallows, who was being hung by a single tough guard and her slave. Easy enough, just kill two people. The problem was--as soon as you instigate the fight, the guard literally summons four equally strong guards from thin air, all of which are right next to her so repositioning her is useless. This *by itself* would be a very challenging encounter, but it gets better. The woman had a permanent aura on her that increased her dodging abilities and those of her allies to ludicrous degrees--meaning I basically could not hit her, or anyone around her. The way I beat this encounter was, no joke--teleporting her three times in a row, at max range, into another encounter entirely with some evil bug things, and the bugs killed her.  The encounter I just spoke about could have been talked about with the same words, but in an entirely positive tone. Because technically, I just teleported a woman three blocks away and had bugs rip her apart. And that's ""awesome"". Truth be told, it actually was somewhat fun. The crux of the issue is this: the rational person inside of me is screaming in agony when I play Divinity, while the fun-loving idiot inside of me is very satisfied. I know for a fact that this encounter was unbelivably poor. But because I beat it in a *special* way, I'm almost tricked into believing blatant disregard for things like balance, fairness, and sensibility produced something cool. It's like junk food. It's a momentary rush that quickly wears off when you realize that ""cool trick"" you pulled off was probably just a set of drapes set up to hide a super ????ed up game.  A lot of the encounters are like that, except some are even worse, in that the ""trick"" to the fight is the literal one way to proceed. There's a witch that will set up a MASSIVE fire resistance debuff on your party and then cast a fire spell, instantly killing the entire group. The only way to beat this fight without losing a party member is to bless the flames underneath her so you get fire immunity before she casts her debuff. Once you do that the fight is a cakewalk. It is an actual puzzle with one solution.  There are other encounters that are just laughably bad. If I played a tabletop RPG where a DM pit me against 15 slow moving clay soldiers that respawn indefinitely until one of them is killed, where each of them gets their own turn and they only have one attack, I would quit that game on the spot. There's another fight that's such a literal waste of your time it's unreal. You start out with dozens of oil slugs, which turn into more slugs, which turn into fire slugs, which ignites the oil and causes the whole area to be lit on fire, which heals the slugs and hurts you. Also every slug has a ton of HP. That fight took me FIFTY FIVE MINUTES but only took me one try.  The final fight: I audibly laughed when I realized the final battle is just an immense battle royale between three factions, where both the magisters and the antagonist's forces have 5+ people and each of them gets at least three actions per turn. I seriously just played dead with my undead characters and WATCHED the fight happen, until only one enemy remained with a tiny amount of HP. This sort of??????should not be the optimal strategy in the climax of the game. Still somehow was not worse than the last fight of DOS1!  In my DOS1 review, I said the game was flawed to an unbelivable extent, but that I had fun, so I gave it a thumbs up. Why does that not apply here? Because the context behind the game makes the state of the product totally unforgivable.  To begin, DOS2 was a kickstarter project after DOS1 had already gotten kickstarted and been the most successful game for Larian in...ever. Additionally, DOS2 was in early access for almost a year and a half, supposedly to gain feedback to improve the product. Larian got feedback, and they ignored it. Changes to the armor system were heavily requested. Changes to the initiative system were heavily requested. Changes to the stat system were heavily requested. None of these things happened. As far as I can tell, Larian did not make a single change to the game during early access that actually made the game better, with the sole exception of adding full voice acting--which was probably planned anyway but only carried out during the pre-release hype.   The best part? DOS2 came out unfinished after a YEAR of early acess and a huge crowdfunding campaign. Even ignoring the fact that Act 4 is rushed-out trite, I cannot understand that a high-budget crowdfunded sequel was released with multiple game-breaking bugs. And I mean game breaking. I don't take this stuff lightly. About 15% of the quests I played were bugged to some extent, some of them were literally unfinishable.  When I played DOS1, I kind of got the picture that Larian knew what they were doing but were being intentionally transgressive for the sake of being different. Now that I've finished DOS2 I see things in a different light. It really does feel like they just...winged the entire game, and it almost worked. I admire their ...luck? "

I saw a lot of merit to its combat, flexible quests and vibrant presentation, but thought the lack of direction, both from a narrative and gameplay standpoint, alongside some tonal issues, were sore points that kept me from really breaking into it. Several years later and Larian Studios have done just what I hoped they would, making a sequel that retains the strengths of previous game while addressing just about every issue I had with it, and then going even further with additions like full voice acting, something not generally found in the recent wave of cRPG games. Due to the relatively high difficulty and patience required it may still not be for everybody, but Divinity: Original Sin 2 is very much at the pinnacle of the sub-genre and will no doubt prove intoxicating for those who get trapped in its spell.   continue reading [www.newgamenetwork.com] "

I poured countless hours into the first D:OS and fell in love with the game. I was truly blown away by that game. When D:OS 2 became available as early access I immediately bought it to support Larian even though I waited til full release to play it. So far I've put 45 hours into the D:OS 2 and I'm playing on tactitian mode and I'm far from beating it but from everything I've seen so far this game further enhances and polishes the experience from the first game. I have zero complaints, this game is basically perfection. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the genre. It's a mechanicaly deep rpg with a great cast of characters, lore and combat. The game doesn't hold your hand and the story and quests unfold naturally. This isn't a game to rush through, you'll find the most joy out of it if you take your time and explore the world it has to offer.

More like a cliff. * The whole Charm mechanic coupled with the super OP enemies makes it so you'll be spending multiple combat rounds just sitting there, doing nothing except waiting for the Game Over screen.  * Little to no direction in any quests means you have reams of failed quests or quests you just can't ever proceed on. * Crafting is almost useless and feels shoehorned in. * Sometimes voice overs just cut out.

I'm talking:  -""Oh look that npc never prompted me for his quest so now I'm locked from one of the things that had me most curious and to fix that I'd have to reload 20-30 hours of gameplay ago"",  -""Oh look I somehow have a 5th party member when the limit is meant to be 4, but that 5th npc can't really act and is attacked by all allied npcs, and there's no way to get rid of it"".  -""Oh look because I used another one of the game's many options of approach (which is a really cool thing in theory) the story's all ????ing backwards"" -""Oh look I killed the boss before he could transform into his ""true"" form, removing the discussion prompt that I'm supposed to get from finishing that, guess I ain't finding out what happens next with that...""  Last but not least: I just finished the final fight, but my main character died right before and I didn't get to resurect him, so the other characters get the final choices in the game...okay that's fine I guess...  BUT WAIT! Then, after the cinematic regarding that choice, there's only my main character left and I guess there's a bit of game left to play (new game+ kinda thing, perhaps?) but since he died in the last fight and all the other party members are gone, I get a game over prompt, allowing me to either load a previous save (before the final fight) OR just go to main menu.   TL;DR: Game's story's pretty good. Mechanics are nothing revolutionary, sometimes annoying but mostly bearable, bugs completely ruin immersion and make me not recommend the game in it's current state."

You can only change between a few preset faces, as far as customization goes. And then almost every male melee armor has that super fat leg-armor skin - I just don't get it. It doesn't make sense at all. Immersion killer.  There is a fine line between nerdy vs. nerdy while still being cool. This game is much more on the nerdy side. Nothing wrong with it though. Just not for me. Similar to when Metal bands go viking/mythologic. Just not for everyone. I'm sure it's a good if not great game, but you gotta like it from the beginning.

I've been reading, however, that if you haven't left the island yet, you are still in the tutorial! Immediate kudos for a content-packed game.  Having played the original Divinity tile from 2002, I've seen this game develop from a Diablo-esque point-and-click action RPG to the turn-based strategy game that is now Divine Divinity: Original Sin 2. Although I've missed a game or two since then, I wasn't quite sure what the storyline was, but the game clearly helps you understand what's been going on in the world of Rivellon right from the start. The immediate immersion into the game has the amazing quality to have me asking questions and wanting to seek out the answers to those questions. I was compelled to keep playing as I see the story unfold and each decision leads to more tangled pieces of the web of mystery that I need to solve.  The combat was easy to figure out immediately and I have to give Larian Studios another amazing pat on the back for integrating Full Controller Support for a turn-based isometric RPG. One of my big turn-offs is that, although I've played for keyboard and mouse combo for many years, I like my gamepad much better and will not buy any titles that don't support it.  There's some dispute about the Tactician mode and whether or not it's too hard. Having played 8 hours in Tactician mode, I finally discovered that if I wanted to enjoy the game and be able to progress in it, that I would have to play in Classic mode. Even in Classic Mode, the fights are still difficult and I've had to play a few of those, get killed multiple times, go level up my characters and improve my gear, and then finally win. Sometimes winning just barely with half my party killed.  The character creation was a little strange from most RPGs I've played, since you aren't really locked into a particular class and you can be whatever you want, based on the allocation of your Talents and Skills. I chose to play as origin character Ifan ben-Mezd, since I wanted to find out more about the storyline and how people fit into it. The build-selection during character creation made it easy to figure out what Skills and Talents were appropriate for the style of play you wanted for your main character. I always choose a good combination of melee and magic, so Battlemage was perfect for me.  Character dialogues have an added flair to them that give you extra choices based on certain tags you have or aquire or choices specific to certain origin characters.  The voiceovers are amazing and abundant, even down to having your own personal narrator. Many RPGs don't put that level of artisitic detail into their games when it comes to audio choices.  The environment is beautifully rendered and I enjoy it in full 4K resolution on my 65in. television. Full camera control with zoom in and out makes the environment easy to navigate.  Overall notes about Divinity: Original Sin 2:  * Content-packed (packed like it could rival the amount of content in Skyrim) * Mysterious and interesting storyline that makes you want to keep playing * Combat system is easy to figure out, but beware of Tactician Mode (was too hard for me) * Full Gamepad Support in a turn-based RPG (a rare find...I would play Tyranny if it had  Gamepad support) * Detailed voiceovers and soothing soundtrack * Great-looking environment that scales well to 4K resolutions  I hope this review helps someone!"

And not just the illusion of choices, every situation you encounter has so many ways to get through that it's not too improbable to say you could most likely replay this game for thousands of hours and never get bored.  This game is more or less dungeons & dragons in a game engine, while you could say other games are like dungeons & dragons this game practically IS dungeons & dragons, aside from the fact that unless you're playing game master mode you can't make things like persuasion checks in the midst of combat/etc.  It would be an injustice to call this game anything but a masterpiece, it easily sits on top of the rpg world, rivaling all including possibly my #1 rpg of all time Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup[crawl.develz.org].

Pros:  - Story: Amazing Introduction that ramps up to a very good confusing mid game meltdown and ends in emotional chaos. - Gameplay: Top Notch, skills, spells, interactions, AI, everything feels smooth and fights never get boring. - Length: You dont know when the game is finally over it is soooo long and thats a good thing - Difficulty: On Tactician the game starts absolutely brutal, towards the end it unfortunately becomes easier except a few exceptions who are crazy hard again.   Cons:  - Merchants: 1 Hour waiting to get a chance of new piece of gear, no gear leveling with you, lots of unique armors or weapons capped at level 18. You can fix this though by using mods but then you get no achievements. It's not noticeable until the very end but then you notice it very hardly, to the point you go afk for 1 hour to get some new gear.  - Skills: Some skills felt lacking, especially the source skills resolve into 2-3 being better then all the others which makes you feel pidgeon holed since the enemies on harder diffs are going to spam you with the good stuff. Some skills npc's use cant be learned... also you cant make true new classes in the SDK currently which is a big downer  - Story: I understand that with so many choices it gets more complex to keep track of everything, sometimes the game does not explain or give you a chance on understanding why a character in the story would do something. One example would be Gareth if you chose to destroy everyone but side with him always, he still will be opposing you at the end while not explaining why so yeah thats unfortunately not the only story let downs.  - Thievery: only 1 pickpocket per NPC per character this is ridiculous by the astronomical prices you have to pay and the minimal gold you get for selling stuff.

Every button seems grey'd out, but I guess that's just the design? Took me a few minutes to figure that out. I had to make a profile to make a character. Not really sure what that was about. Character design was pretty good. Lot of options, at least. You can make your own character or play as a sort-of Hero. Made an custom Elven Ranger.  Get into the game, click through the first sort-of cutscene and play around with the controls. Talk to the person, they tell me to talk to someone else. No objective, it seems like. Just kinda figure it out yourself. Whatever, I've played games like that before. Go to talk to someone else, for some reason I kick them in the face. No clue why. Eventually find my way to the end. Magic fire stuff happens. I get to the top of the ship. It says run to the life boat so I do. Says I can't get in. Spider thing traps me and kills me. Guess I have to kill spiders. Loot some stuff, kill spiders, get on life boat. Get told their may be people trapped. ???? that, let's get out of here.  Now I'm on a beach. I find a bow, recruit the Red Prince, and accidently shoot him the face. Go to some gates, some people blow some lizardwoman up, I eat her body to get a memory of some dude who escaped. Then I realized the Red Prince was still at the rock I met him at. He just decided not to follow me, I guess. I walk around, find Fane the undead dude. Walk around more, meet some turtles who try to kill me. The Red Prince decided to stop following me again, so it's just me and Fane. Kill them, loot their stuff. Go to city, meet some people, do some missions, get told about an underground tunnel. go to tunnel, but it's 'guarded' by a ghoul or something. He wipes me twice. He's undead, so he gets healed by poison. All my attacks are poison. One the last attempt, 3 of my guys die, I only have 2 ressurection scrolls. Sorry Lone Wolf. Go to cave, fire slugs want to talk to me, I can't understand them, they attack me. I accidently shoot and kill the Red Prince and quit the game and request refund.  ---  I'm usually pretty decent at games, and can figure out how to play pretty quickly. I mean, I've been playing video games since I was 5. This game, though, is overly complicated to the point of insanity. You have to micromanage everything, and sometimes the game just throws a curveball at you you'll never expect. Like why is my left click suddenly attack instead of walk, or vice versa? I don't know and it doesn't explain it. An Assassin comes up looking for the Red Prince and wipes your party in two turns? Cool, why not. Party member decides not to move and you get in a fight with one party member 200 yards away? Yeah, that's a thing. It just doesn't make sense.  There are positives. The combat, when it works, is pretty good. It's solid turn based combat. It is kinda infuriating when you try to shoot an enemy and your character, for no real reason, decides to walk towards them through fire and poison, but apparently you have to deal with that. Loot make sense, even if it isn't explained very well. The crafting is cool and doesn't seem to have any negatives. The trading is pretty cool. Instead of saying ""Item X costs 40g"" it's ""Item X is worth 40g"". You can offer your own items and gold to buy it. If you want to buy boots worth 5g, you can offer up a 3g book and  2g to buy it. If you offer, say, a 10g book for it, the merchant will like you more. Pretty cool.  Overall, I can't recommend the game. It's just way too complicated. Not for the sake of fun, it seems, but just for the sake of making the game harder. I'm all for hard games, but this one doesn't make any sense. Dark Souls, for instance, doesn't just change on you in the middle of a fight. This does, and I can not stand that. In the two hours I played, I did not get a single moment of enjoyment out of it"

1115,I3LINK,28,No,0,2017-10-07,Not Recommended,242.3,"I loved this game when it was released, as well as it's predecessor, and even gave it a raving 10/10 review initially. But after 200+ hours my opinion has somewhat changed, I'll explain. So it's about the combat, which seems to have a lot of depth to it at first, with lots of customisation and potential strategies. But when you take more time to try and get a bit more out of the game and actually put together any form of strategies, you start to realise that combat wise the game doesn't really have so much to offer. For a start let me point out, in case you haven't yet played this installment, how they changed things drastically from DOS1. The armour and shields now indicate whether or not you can inflict status attacks. This completely changes the dynamics of combat, and leaves most battles feeling like a bit of a mess. You see in the first game you could confidently control the flow of combat by knowing who you could inflict status attacks to and plan turns in advanced like a game of chess. Now it feels like inflicting these status attacks comes more down to chance, whether they will be protected or not, and so it becomes difficult to control the flow of combat.  Another problem is that most enemies have some form of teleportation, coupled with their keen prioritisation for attacking your lower health characters. This means that speccing some form of glass canon/mage type of character who sits on the back lines is completely not viable. And I've tried using the Stench talent, but this doesn't lower the chance enough of them attacking your mage unless your mage has near enough the same health as your other characters. What this ultimately means is that all of your characters naturally are required to all have a good amount of armour and shields. The glass canon perk only becomes viable if you can make your character completely untargettable via things like stealth, which is just absurd to create a whole build over. Warriors don't appear to have any real zone of control, so even if the enemy doesn't have teleport they still always manage to walk their way right past your front line. HP/constitution also is completely irrelivent along with certain talents, because any build anticipating to take hits to your HP can easily leave you stun locked by the enemy. This in turn means that necromancer life drain type of builds are pretty much unviable or far too unreliable.  Another problem is the stealth mechanics which are a complete mess and to this day I still don't fully understand how it's supposed to work, or whether they developers even really know themselves. You can chosse to initiate from stealth but then leave your team to fall the the back of the turn qeue putting you at a significant disadvantage, or if you try to leave them in stealth when initiating they unreliably get revealed, it's all just very confusing, and I haven't managed to find a reliable way to benefit from stealth.  Also something I noticed from day one which I was always annoyed about is the lack of diversity in weapon types. I mean a club/mace should deal crushing damage, a sword should cause bleeding, a spear should deal armour piercing, etc... They created all these amazing systems in the game like the bleeding and armour and yet there's no difference between a sword and a mace, there's no incentive to equip one or the other and it just comes down to aesthetic preference. It's a complete oversite and waste of potential and ultimately a let down in what could have otherwise been a great game.  I've really wanted to love this game, the overrall style of the game, the story, characters, the world, it's all really amazing and well done. But the combat is just too much of a mess, and once you realise that there's really not much strategy to be made with the combat then the game starts to feel quite underwhelming. It's funny cause I never really had this problem with the first one, so I think they've ruined what was a perfectly good formula. What they should have done is created a system more similar to XCOM 2, in which case the AI generally prioritises targetting characters which are closest in range, which is due to a higher accuracy. This means you can actually predict who the enemy is going to attack and plan ahead. In XCOM you don't tend to have random enemies who can teleport to your backline, and if so then it's balanced to make it work. In DOS 2 I feel like the developer hasn't balanced these issues correctly and despite how long the game has been released they would have done well to patch these kind of problems by now. Instead they've left the game in a dead state which is unplayable in my opinion. The combat is ultimately very shallow, so apart from some nice story telling I wouldn't expect much depth to the gameplay."

341,Finjas,100,5,0,2017-10-08,Recommended,87.3,"When I finished the first Original Sin, I thought that was the highest point for Larian Studios. It had everything great about oldschool RPGs and more, it was inventive in both gameplay mechanics and story. It had an interesting world to explore. Could they possibly top that?  Divinity OS2 shows how hard they worked for it. It's a huge improvement on something that was already great.  The core basically didn't change all that much. Game mecahinics are the same, although reworked a lot: balance is much better. The inclusion of Physical and Magic armour makes it so much simplier (not easier!) to plan out your tactics in battle. Writing has changed too. It's now trying to be something like the game master narrates the whole thing to you instead of letting you expierence everything in first person. The change may seem dubious, but it works here for one simple reason - D:OS 2 feels like a tabletop RPG all through. The changes are subtle, but they do a lot. The First game was a solid CRPG expierence. This one, though, because of the changes, -- the writing, the mechanics, co-op, -- this is something more. It's no longer just a CRPG. The trailer didn't lie! No matter how you choose to play, you'll expierence endless layers of pen and paper RPG depth! So much potential for roleplaying. Even if you play alone.  The game leads you to an adventure you get sucked into. The adventure you won't soon forget if you stick to the end.  And the story, especially if you play as one of the preset characters, is just fantastic. I don't remember when was the last time I hesitated so much about making story-related choices in games. Or even not story-related. Some side quests made me do things I feel so conflicted about even now! Love it.  Games like this make me remember why I like games more than just as a time killing medium. And Larian manages to remind me about it over and over again for... oh, dear, 15 years already!"

The disjointed nature of the story really hurts the game, despite having such a strong start with Fort Joy, which was easily ten times better than Cyseal (though it lacked the same charm). The dual dialogue system being gone also means that co-op interractions have a lot less weight to them; similarly, origin characters don't really have interactions with each other, which really brings the experience down at times. The disjointed story becomes especially apparent after Fort Joy. It's revealed the player character is a Godwoken, and depending on your race, you represent your God and must become Divine. The Gods push the whole ""war against the other gods/races"" thing a lot, but when the time comes around where its every man for himself, its quickly resolved by the the antagonist, Dallis, and now our Gods just hate us in general and its no longer a plot point that matters. Even the endings of the game are all a let down, with the outcomes being very general... you could honestly compare it to the Mass Effect 3 endings.  The biggest problem with this game is that combat scenarios are far too similar to one another, thanks to the armor system. Unlike the first game, crowd control and status effects must first go through physical or magic armor, or else they are completely resisted by the target. While, in the beginning, it seemed like a nice solution to fix the problem the first game had, where you could CC targets one after the other and just wail on them for free, the armor system REALLY hurts the point of elemental surfaces and the like. Outside of Fort Joy, I found no use for them; everything just had too much armor for anything to work. Your strongest abilities were the only thing that did much of anything, and if you were a magic user, using a staff for damage was awful as wands were a lot stronger.  Skills, stats and talents are all pretty homogenized in the game. Strength, finesse, and intelligence are all ""more damage"". Memory gives you more slots for more abilities, and wits gives you more crit chance and lets you detect treasures (you can supplement this for a wits potion or the clear minded ability, since the amount of wits you need to detect stuff is pretty low). For melee builds, Necromancer is almost a must, because the health returns and utility of many necromancer abilities are irreplacable. For any character, though, being a hybrid (unless you are just a full mage) is a must because many abilities in each magic tree do not rely on intelligence to be useful. It lets your characters have much more access to abilities outside of Warfare, Scoundrel, and Huntsman, but some just aren't good or don't really add much in the way of variety, except for Necromancer. Civil abilities vary in their usefulness, but one that I found particularly vexing was persuasion. Sometimes, you can't really control who an NPC talks to during certain events, and if you lack persuasion, you may end up missing out on certain events. Some dialogues have stat checks, but they still require persuasion to do anything. I suppose I was expecting it to be like an Obsidian RPG in that regard.  Overall, I think Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a step back to a degree. I don't neccessarily not recommend it (but I can't write a mixed review yet...) but I really feel like its lacking in a lot of areas. The story can't be helped, though its still better than the first game, but a lot of this stuff could probably be fixed in an inevitable Enhanced Edition, which I feel like this game sorely needs. Its still a game worth its asking price, and if you are looking for a good co-op RPG, this is the best one out right now."

275,Cassette,445,3,1,2017-10-08,Not Recommended,53.1,"I wish I could give the game a Maybe or Mixed rating. It's not a bad game per se, there's a lot to be enjoyed here: deep RPG mechanics, lots of roleplay, decent story and characters...  But the fun stops with the combat, while the core elements of it are very fun with all the tactics and elemetal madness going on, most of the time it just feels cheap, unfair, unbalaced and so on and on and on. Enemies always come in overwhelming numbers, with too much health and armor, they also happen to be omniscient and know all your weak spots, have more Action Points and sometimes they even ignore initiative/round order among others.  The difficulty is all over the place, in Classic mode (Normal difficulty) a single enemy a level above you can cause very serious damage to your party if you're not careful, if they're a single level below, it's a cakewalk. But if you do lower the difficulty to Explorer mode (Easy difficulty), then there's no challenge, it's so patronizingly easy that there's no fun. There's a real problem with stats bloat here.  The armor system is just stupid, all it does is add a second health bar that completely negates damage and status effects until depleted, afterwards it's useless, you can restore it, but it'll go down again soon enough. I really don't understand why they decided to make it this way.  And somehow I always felt underleveled to most situations even after completing all the quests I could get and trying not to stray away from the path too much, it just felt very unbalaced by the end of it all. And while I'm completely against it, you can't even grind levels in this game.   I can see people enjoying the combat, but to me it just didn't felt right, I didn't felt the diffilculty was because of my (lack of) skill, but because of bad design. I've played lots of CRPGs, including Original Sin 1, but this is the first time I ran into something like this. It's a shame, because I'm really enjoying my time with the game, just not the combat, the polar opposite of the first game, where I really loved the combat but not much the rest.  There's other little quirks with the game, but I don't think it's worth mentioning since the worst aspects are already here.  I would recommend the game if you have the patience to deal with the crazy difficulty or if you just don't care at all and don't mind playing a very, very stupidly easy RPG while on Explorer mode. But if you're like me, and don't like the concept of tying the difficulty to levels and stats or just didn't like the idea of anything written here, then there's better CRPGs out there for the likes of us."

585,Xaymar,386,3,0,2017-10-08,Not Recommended,50.3,"If you want Bethesda or Ubisoft style ""Features"" (bugs) this game might be something for you. It is extremely rushed out, seems to have never been tested as almost everything has at least one bug, has several glitches/exploits (infinite money, infinite turns, infinite damage, infinite rounds, ...), has soft & hard locks, randomly crashes when you are the Server and more broken stuff. One of our characters in the party had a permanent ""Warm"" status applied.  In addition to that, after Act 1 the rest of the game is way too fast and there is just not enough to do. We ended up staging a revolution against Magisters, Paladins, Demons, Voidwoken and one time even against critters. Act 2 is barely 2 hours long, Act 3 & 4 are about 1 hour total and then there is the next to impossible boss battle which is completely based on RNG. The final battle has a 1 in 2 chance to instantly murder your entire party, even if you fully build HP+Armor.  Basically, get this if you like being tricked into buying it by watching footage from Act 1, then get mad at all the bugs, glitches and exploits that you or NPCs may accidentally encounter and break the entire game.   VisualsThe game overall has an almost unchanging environment, everything looks very the same except a very few areas in which you then spend less than 5 minutes. Be prepared to see the same over and over again, because there is just no variation in the game.  GameplayThere's nothing really special to the game. It is a birds-eye-view kind of do-it-yourself RPG Action game with some elements of Story added in and Combat being way to overused to be anything special. There is also forced stealth sections (lovely /s) and forced PVP sections (yaaaaay /s), so if you were planning on actual coop there is none here in those areas.  BalanceYou won't find any balance in this game. Melee is overpowered as heck, Archery is completely broken, Mages are probably the only useless class as they either die Turn 1 or end up doing a little less than no damage at all unless Source Points are used. A lot of the spells need to be reworked as it otherwise makes absolutely no sense to ever have them memorized.   CombatCombat is turn based with each player having Action Points and each action costing these points. Unfortunately this is the area with the most bugs and is also horribly broken. If you test around a bit you can easily find a way to never have the enemy have another turn, but still resetting all your cooldowns and source points, resulting in ridiculously easy fights except in areas where fleeing no longer works because the plot device was turned on.  StoryThe story is your average ""Save the World or let it burn in flames!"" Story, very linear with choices that have absolutely no effect on the ending itself. The game could have been shipped without the main story and nobody would have noticed anything different as it is practically non-existent and was actually more of a side-quest until the ending came around. The endings are pretty as disappointing as the Mass Effect Colors endings, so brace yourself to be disappointed.  PVP""This games story absolutely needs PVP sections!"" - Larian Studios I don't even know why they put this in. They could have easily changed the sections to work for all players at the same time, not just one person that murders the rest because it's horribly imbalanced. To give you a run down, in the first PVP arena I two-shot the melee fighter after he successfully killed the ranger. Second arena we just gave someone the title and in the third arena we just Source Pointed each other into oblivion (Melee won because end-game melee > Range bug-fest > Toy Mage; seriously, mages don't do anything except statuses after Act 3 or so).

628,CromX,214,6,5,2017-10-08,Not Recommended,245.5,"I cannot recommend this game. The developers have purposely taken every opportunity they can to literally troll players with instant death and unavoidable death mechanics that frankly turn this game into a chore to play. Simply walking a map which you walked a hundred times can be a serious chore, due to slow movement speed and then instant death from environmental things they set up that you can never see coming. Case in point covering a portal marker with instant death fog. A portal that previously was usable with no problems. And having no idea that they decided to put death fog all over that portal marker, you can port there and die instantly losing any progress you might have made.   These portal markers are meant to be convenience portal stones so you don't have to (slow) walk back and forth across the maps. So one would think they would not misuses the mechanic and the trust of the player in such a way. Not with these guys. I'm sure it was great fun, im my case I lost 20+ minutes of playtime. I had 30 mins to play before leaving, and  instead of satisfying game play I got this.   And that is just ONE example. How about playing for 10+ hours only to realize a quest is bugged and can't continue? Or having missed a valuable quest object hours back and the NPC you needed to see is missing or dead? You literally play this game in fear that your quests are all broken or not explained enough to where they make any sense. You can imagine the amount of reloading and backtracking that takes place in these scenarios.   Additonally:  1) atrocious inventory system. You never know which items will be useful later on, so you have to keep them all. And its ridiculous how much stuff you have. And lets be frank this game makes you interact with your inventory every three seconds which just makes this glaring problem unbearable at times.  2) overuse of teleport pyramids. In DOS 1 they had pyramid teleport items you could use in your inventory. It was quaint and used in some places to get around puzzles. It was never terribly fun as you had to trawl through your inventroy find it, toss one out, then trawl again find the other and then teleport to it. Rinse and repeat and it gets really old really fast. Well in DOS 2 they have doubled or even trippled down on this. EVERYTHING uses these lame pyramid teleport items, a bloody broken bridge just so you will have to dig through that ANNOYING inventory and port people across. ANNOYING. I get it they think their pyramid teleport stones are cool! WE GET IT, PLEASE STOP WITH IT!  3) PUZZLES, everything is a puzzle. And lots of time its obscure, or just a huge time sink. The occasional puzzle can be good for content, but like everything in this game its an overused mechanic. I swear you do one lame puzzle that takes like 30 mins and then in the next room over another one. It's gets old real fast and often involved trawling though the inventory and reading the THOUSANDS of books they drop during the game. Otherwise google it if you can find it. It's a real chore.  4) Fights often are just huge alpha strikes by the enemy that CC your entire party if not kill them outright. Its a frequent occurrence that you will sit turn after turn CCed until death.   All in all stay away from this game unless you are a die hard DOS 1 fan. I had been putting up with all those annoyances because for the most part I figured it was just the developers not understanding the impact all these minor issues were having on the player. But once they start trolling people with instant death at portal markers for god's sake its time to come to terms with the fact these are not the best of guys. They intentionally want to waste your time and ruin your game play, and in a lot of ways they succeed.  Stay away, or buy heavily discounted."

(But very fun!) I put 144H to finish one playthrough.  The best way I can put it is: it's probably the best game I've ever played since Witcher 3.  I backed this game after playing the first Original Sin, which left me wanting to play even more! I definitely made the right decision. There's a lot of freedom in this game; playing with friends, playing alone and even doing our own DM games. I only played it in Single player mode so far, but I'm very much looking forward to playing with friends when they get the game. Here's a general pros and cons list (from a single player perspective):  + Graphics are great + Runs really well + Gameplay is fantastic (if you like turn-based games) + You can pretty much do anything and kill anyone you want + Voice acting is phenominal + Companions each have their own backgrounds which tie in with the main story line, really giving you a sense of wonder and motivation to find out what's going on and how to 'fix' it. + Workshop and Modding (read below for more)  - There were a few issues with quests not finishing properly, or not being able to talk properly to some NPCs, leading to missed XP and story (but a lot of that got fixed recently) - Tactician mode is difficult. Really makes you work hard to find as much XP before moving onto other parts. Especially at the beginning of the game.  Now here's the BEST part of all this: Larian even gave us the Divinity Engine 2 to us for making our own Campains and DM games. Which means...we can look forward to people creating their own stories and Campaigns in the future - something which I really look forward to seeing and playing.   Get it now! It's totally worth it!

For example; a battle where I can't loot a corpse (the arachnid in the graveyard).  - More bugs. I discovered that the reason I couldn't target enemies in the Driftwood arena was because I wan't zoomed in enough. After I realized this I was able to beat the competition.  - Even more bugs (getting access to a waypoint early because I was on a cliff overlooking it, which allowed me to fast-travel to the waypoint and expedite my storyline).

116,WinterBit,477,3,0,2017-10-09,Not Recommended,48.2,"The game is fun and great, until you leave the first island.   Once you leave Fort Joy, the games quality takes a sharp nosedive as it starts throwing encounters at you way out of your league without a warning unless you notice a single corpse laying on the ground and conjecture there might be enemies that will be spawned on you. Then there are so many glitches in the game it's extremely frustrating, such as the game straight up lying to you on who actually goes next in a turn based system. Such as MC, Party member #2, then #3, then #1, oh but wait, the boss gets a turn not shown on the UI and kills two of your party members because ""Didn't expect that did you?"". Then there's the extreme ramp in difficulty and scaling which puts MMO's to shame, from levels 1-10 you're increasing your damage by two or three points every level, but once enemies start hitting 11 and 12, their damage skyrockets by a hundred points.  The difficulty is all over the place as well. You can easily take on a 4v4 hidden hero encounter at level 9, while all the other enemies are level 12, and auto-revive into stronger versions with relative ease and tactics. But you talk to the wrong person, they forcefully initiate a fight 4v1, summon a monster in the middle of your entire team, and deals enough damage to OHKO your party members with a basic melee, and can opportunity attack. So you just fought a hidden boss encounter at level 9 and had a tough time but did eventually win it, and now you're getting OHKO'd by a simple minion a single character can summon multiple of?  It's fun, but manually save every three to four minutes, before you talk to anyone, before you walk into unknown territory, and after every single fight. The games autosave does a rather poor job of autosaving, and will make you lose hours of progress because ""Oh you talked to this person and didn't know it was going to be a fight."" There are a lot of forced encounters, save often, know what you're getting into before you get this game and learn it will throw artificial difficulty at you."

This is mind boggling considering how long it was in early access. Below you can see just some of the issues which can infuriate you. When/if the devs fix these, I'll happily recommend the game to every RPG fan.  1.Whenever I start the game, it resets my controls. Every. Single. Time.  2.Inventory management is clumsy AF. You can't move around multiple items and that's a royal pain the????? which is only exacerbated by the fact that each of the characters in your party has their own inventory and they can't use consumables or gold from eachother unless you manually transfer it between them. Might work in co-op, but it sucks in single-player.  3.Civil skills are character-specific instead of party wide. So you may have pumped a bunch of points into persuasion for 1 of you characters, but if you don't specifically click on them to initiate conversation, it'll be wasted as the game will only check the persuasion skill of the char who started dialog. This is made even worse when NPCs start the conversation, because then you have no control over which character will be involved. Another example is with the bartering skill.

Or if you accidentally click on a 0 value spoon because the NPC you wanted to talk to moved and now everyone hates your dirty, thieveing guts and you thought ""damn, i should reload"" - well, your last save may be an hour ago.

501,Martyr81,83,39,1,2017-10-10,Not Recommended,106.1,"Upfront, I'll say this game does have some fun gameplay at times. However a litany of problems make me give this a negative review.  - Dumbfoundingly inconsisent difficulty. Battles range from entertainingly fun to stupendously, insultingly difficult. Seriously, you should never have to go into a battle knowing EXACTLY what is going to happen in order to have a chance of surviving (not winning, just surviving). And the only reason you know what's about to happen is because you've tried it half a dozen times and failed each time.  - Weak story compared to D:OS, and heavy use of sad, tired and predictable tropes. Half the time it wasn't even clear what we were trying to accomplish, and who/what we were fighting against or for. And when major plot points did occur, most of the time our response was ""Really? We're doing this again? Sigh...""  - For a game that encourages you to forge your own way, it punishes you for not following some pre-assumed path through the world. Heaven help you if you choose a different direction - enemies do not scale with level, and gear that would help you manage is prohibitively expensive. So if you head west when the game expects you to head east, you'll struggle.  - Battles that break the game's own pre-established rules. Examples: repeat casting of abilities which have multi-round cooldowns, and stacking identical status ailments. Case in point: The Sallow Man's Airborne Plague, which bypasses all armour (physical and magical), stacks with itself (I was at -15 Con at one point because of three repeat casts) and can be cast EVERY ROUND.  - Inconsistent lore/world impacts: you can kill someone and consume their soul, only for them to show up again later, apparently none the worse for wear. (Yay, that achieved a lot...).  - Multiplayer feels like two single player games occurring simultanously, with some quests not progressing or closing because the wrong player spoke to the quest giver. To add to that, if the speaker doesn't have the required item for a fetch quest, too bad - having it in the party isn't enough (but the game doesn't let you know that, does it? That would be too much to ask...)  - Quest system is broken. Somewhat repaired with a patch, but if you'd progressed past a certain point, the damage was done. The Tarquin side-quest was just a balls-up.  - My partner, who was using a controller (I use keyboard/mouse), had endless difficulty with target selection and interactions with the environment. Certain skills just wouldn't work (no reason was given - you just can't select this character because we say so). The controller interface also made line-of-sight hard to gauge, so several times critical actions were lost because of some unseen obstacle.  - Multi-stage boss battles: stop, just stop with this tired, over-used and just irritating chiche. This has been done so many times it's just not interesting, exciting or surprising.  - Some puzzles have an exact solution required, but the game gives you absolutely no guidance or hints. Another case in point: the Cursed Revenants in the Lizard Embassy. We gave up trying to solve that and just left them there. We got around them enough to finish the quest, but they'll be sitting there in the ruins till Judement Day.  More on the battle difficulty: if you're at the correct character level for a given encounter (ie a L5 party against L5 opponents) I don't think it's unreasonable that your party members are able to survive the opening salvo. I GM a Pathfinder group and so understand that some encounters are meant to be more challenging that others, depending on their importance in the plot progression. However, given that in 95% of encounters one or more of the opponents invariably go first, the number of times one (or more) of our party members were one-shot killed or disabled before they've had a chance to act is kinda ludicrous. This ties back into my previous point where you have to know exactly what is about to happen in order to have a chance of getting through the battle (which I consider meta-gaming in a cRPG). Sure, give the enemies superior starting positions and outnumber the party, but don't compount that by making every mook immediately superior to the whole party.  For a game that we've spent over 100 hours on, this has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I can't say I've enjoyed it. We've given up trying to win the final battle, and to be honest I couldn't care less about how it ends. There were occasional moments of fun, but the negatives outweigh them."

The origin characters are well written and makes the story more personal, especially seeing as you can decide to play the character however you wish.   Protip: Don't install mods until the game is ""finished"", steam forces you to update the game so that is likely to break mods.

It has fun combact, story and the voice acting is quality. I think if the game looks interesting you have to play it! More in depth below.  Story: so far i feel the story is more in the people you meet rather than the overall world. Honestly i dont know 100% what the story is about but i feel that i will over time an im perfectly fine with that. Saying that the world feels like it has a personality of its self. every inch feels as if it has history which makes the overall experiance better.  Combat: Although some people wont like the slower pace of the game i fondly love it. It is not to slow that keeps me waiting impatiantly and isnt to fast where i make constant mistakes (althought i still make alot). I can still plan out my attack with a wide variety of skills all very unique and fun. The level design in these combact areas also alow for alot of strategic battles that leaves me very satisfied.   Voice acting and animations: Voice acting is one of the best i ahve coem across in recent history. Remember get pet pal perk because you will miss alot of amazing voice acting and story that makes the environment feel even richer. Animations are as good as they can get.  There are a few teenie weenie issues that are very much issues rather than an annoyances. for example some items automatically going onto the hot bar and your character when not being controlle somtimes drift a few step to the side which walk into a trap, elemental grounds or worst of all into the sight of a shrieker which can get annoying espeailly if you have no resurrection scrolls or a recent save but in the scheme of things, meh.

Gameplay is so much more enjoyable and deeper than for example the Witcher series. Characters are relatable and funny like in Mass Effect games! Makes me so salty to think about it that they stuffed all this to one single indie title...  PROS: After finishing my 14 hour tutorial (EDIT: NVM I'm STILL IN THE TUTORIAL) I can already say this game does everything right and I ducking love it! This is the game that made me belive in the game industry again. I didn't like turn based combat, until now. I didn't like isometric point of view, until now. I didn't care too much about ingame conversations, until now. An RPG game you can play with FRIENDS and even cause drama in the scale of Mario Kart! Dialogue is far from monotonic and doesn't take itself too seriously. Voice acting is excellent to the point I found myself stopping to listen to the dialogue even tho I had finished reading it a while ago. I haven't had this rewarding and brain stimulating singleplayer experience for as long as I can remember. I haven't enjoyed this deep, different and open ways of approach to different situations ever in a videogame before.  If you're being like me and see all the reviews and think ""Should I buy this?

Because Original Sin was such an amazing game, I've followed the progress of its successor's development and watched how Larian, with the help of the community, turned Original Sin 2 into an even better game.  The freedom you have in Original Sin 2 while exploring and the way you're progressing through the game is some of the best I've seen. It gave me mixed feelings of excitement and nostalgia which, at times, made me forget that I'm in the year 2017, and feel the same way that I did while playing Torment or Fallout. It felt new and enticing, the areas are varied and the content is hidden behind actually talking with people or having to read stuff to know what to do. You can mess up and miss out on quests if you kill people and your actions have consequences, I know, I killed everyone in a playtrough. NPC's are not immortal just because they have a generic quest attached to them.  If you're unsure on whether to purchase the game or not, I'll try to help.  PROS: - Varied, visual detailed and beautiful areas. No recycled content (like Generic caves 1 to 40 in Dragon Age 2); - Detailed origin stories that have an effect over multiple encounters in the game; - Fully and adequately voice acted(Apart from 1-2 encounters); - Lots of class combinations and spell interactions; - Extremely satisfying combat; - Level-dependent loot system; - Loads of exploration; - Puzzles; - A plethora of quests, fun ones; - Excellent writing; - Interesting and useful crafting system; - Actions/Consequences; - You can follow your own path and still achieve the endgame; - It does not have the price of an AAA title, it's only 45 euros and offers far more content than its competitors.  CONS:  - In the first few days the game seemed a bit rushed, there's still room for improvements/optimizations; - Using more resources than Mass Effect: Andromeda/ The Witcher 3 on Ultra seems a bit of an overkill; - Found a few placeholder items and unfinished areas; - Difficulties do not make enemies smarter or, at least, they don't appear to be doing it. It's just hp/armor/damage multiplier; - Entire difficult fights can be won instantly; - Sending items to party members is not proximity based; - Pruned talent trees compared to Original Sin;  Few of Today's companies have the dedication and experience to release a polished and entertaining product that offers huge amounts of content at such a low cost. Well, Larian did it.

1381,Geerterig,314,2,1,2017-10-11,Recommended,126.9,"Lemme tell you a story I experienced.  Arrive in a coastal town, pretty calm some magisters here and there. I enter the bar, and there's a guy offering me something. I find out it's hot steamy lizard sex, so, ofcourse, I pay him and go upstairs to the lizard lady. We have a very interesting night. But as soon as I wake up, I find that all my stuff is stolen. There's 5 guys in my room that I don't know. Suprised I ask the lizard lady what's going on, she says she's sorry, but this is a setup.  I get angry, you can't fool me, you can't set me up! Naked and without any weapons I attack the robbers, and I kill them all, taking the weapons of their body to finish of the rest, and using my magic to dish out even more damage. In the end, they all drop dead and I'm victorious. I talk to the lizard lady to ask what just happened, she admits they tried to rob me. The smooth-talker I am decide to forgive her, and say it was worth it for the night I had. She liked what I said, I continue talking to her, we end up having another sexy night. Me covered in blood and my enemies dead on the floor.   10/10, most fun I've ever had in an RPG. Definitely worth the purchase."

What a wonderful RPG this game is.    Pros  -Incredibly depth, but not too much to be overwhelmed -Fantastic story and setting -Great soundtrack and vocals -This game as a whole oozes rich character -Dangerous and rewarding combat -More fun with friends -All around excellent RPG   Cons  -Some bugs here and there, nothing game breaking -Story telling with friends can be hard to keep up with. You have to manually listen in. By the time you realize someone is talking, they're already deep into the conversation and you've missed out  10/10. If you're an RPG fan at all, you should play this game at some point. Even if it's not right this second, put it towards the top of your list and make time for it. Great game all around, and gets better with company."
297,Sou1Ace,280,No,0,2017-10-11,Not Recommended,102,"I just want to say that I love this this game and I think it is well worth the money for the most part. The sound and look are great, the gameplay is fun and hard and the story is nice. All that being said I do not feel I can reccomend it because of the consistant bugs with many of the quests. This may seem like a minor thing, but for a game where a large portion of the experience you gain and many good items you can get come from closing a quest the fact that some quests just can not be completed if you accidently did part of it too early while exploring is detrimental. Two examples:  the quest ""The Purged Dragon"" becomes impossible to finish and close out if you have killed the shriekers in the abandoned camp before freeing Slane  or  the quest ""A Fate Worse Then Death"" being impossible to finish if you give Gratiana ""the soul jar with a name you do not recognize"" instead of her name because it gets rid of that jar and doesn't let you break it so the last necromancer jsut respawn without ever being able to end the quest , and those are only the ones that we have figured out the reason behind the quest bugging out.  ""The Burning Pigs"", ""The Tribe of Saheila"" and ""Signs of Resistance""  also are all unfinishable for me and some of my friends. It really ruins the experience since these bugged quests can not be dropped and started again and once you move from one act to nother all non-closed quests will just end with no reward given and you can not go back to previous acts so if they bug out like the first 2 quests I mentioned then you are just screwed or you have to go back possibly hours of saves to remotely try and fix it or completely start over. My hope is these quests will be fixed soon and if/when that happens the game will fully be 10/10."

Too limited, too slow and a need to reload too many times is a fatal self inflicted wound that this game brings.

Enemies always -- predictably, monotonously -- start with position advantage, or negate yours on the first turn. If you're only mediocre at games, like me, expect to lose hours of your life to forgetting to hit Quick Save, just like the 20-year-old RPGs of your youth, maybe because one of your party members was teleported into a combat with 12 creatures 2 levels higher than you, or you chose a perfectly innoculous-looking dialog option that started an unwanted combat, or you didn't dump all of your attribute points into the randomly chosen challenge question stat.  Co-op is pretty fun but there are some bugged quests (notably, the arenas).  I'm most of the way through Act 2 and doubt I'll finish this one!"

It even has some fun skill building strategy. I have over 80 hours in this game and more than that in its predecessor. I enjoyed the first one.  But that's where it ends. There are tedious puzzles (the ones at the very end of the game being the worst) and illogical mechanics (for example, you can't take any items from dead party members, so if they went down with the Ressurection scroll you're screwed.) The worst is the quest design which means a lot of wasted time running around trying to figure out what ridiculous element you missed so you have to load a save from three days ago. There are also issues with NPCs disappearing after certain points in quest so you can't follow up and close the quest line.   Top it off with another tired and boring story about the main protagonist being touched by divine power and his ascent to godhood. YAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWN. That's been old since before Baldur's Gate. So why not try to mess with the formula and do something different? I was hoping they would be a little more creative with a tired trope in CRPGs. I expected too much.  I gave this game a lot of chances to impress me, and in a few rare instances it did. But it felt more like a chore."

785,Anime Food,122,2,3,2017-10-11,Not Recommended,65.7,"I highly dont recommend any casual players play this game, it is not a funny story adventure game. It is a hardcore rpg grind.  Every fight is ridiculously hard, the AI even in the lowest difficulty is way too smart, and when I say way too smart I mean like 500 IQ. On my normal difficulty play through the AI has many times, attacked their own teammates to heal or remove a status effect, Placed their character perfectly against a wall/barrel/lamp/other player too avoid backstabs, but almost every turn the enemy AI will move just outside of your attack range. THIS IS NORMAL DIFFICULTY. This is one of my biggest issues with the game not to mention the fact that if you stumble onto enemies one or two levels higher then you, you basically lose instantly.   The second issue is this game was named wrong, Divinity: Original Sin 2? Nah more like teleportation gloves the game. Its like the entire ????ing game revolves around this pair of gloves. From beginning to end these gloves are always there being used in one way or another.  Half the time Im playing this game im walking around aimlessly trying to find a fight I can win or looking for some way to teleport across or to somthing.  Edit: Positive things about the game I forgot to mention because I was on a rant  The dialouge in this game is very good, along with the origin stories for your companions are very rich and take you to strange places.  The abilities are really cool, wether you are a trying to be a powerful mage or a strong melee character you are given a vast variety of abilites to shape your characters.  As I mentioned the AI is very hard so if you're looking for some challenge this is right up your alley  And to anyone who thinks this game isn't hard and the statement is laughable you are wrong. The game gives you a warning about the combat before you start and here's a statement from the store page saying the AI is hard ""beware - the games AI 2.0 is our most devious invention to date"" All in all I give this game 3/55"

134,Tamaster,561,40,0,2017-10-12,Recommended,234.5," Review - Divinity: Original Sin 2  ===   RATING: 9.5 / 10 Legendary. There is no other word for it.   Overview Divinity Original Sin 2 (from now DOS2) is the second installment of the Original Sin saga, developed by Larian Studios first time a couple years ago. Veteran RPG makers as they are, they come a long way since they made the first Divine Divinity back in the early 2000's, and also the following chapters which all were good games (No, Beyond Divinity never existed, shhh). DOS2 is a real time RPG with turn based combat, with some new twists in the classic mechanics to keep it modern.  ===   Gameplay Analysis   General Gameplay  There is so much to say about the gameplay of DOS2, there really is. First of all, the thing that astonished me the most among all the good ones, which are really a lot, is the incredible freedom given to the player in all his actions and interactions with NPCs and eventual co-op players alike. The freedom DOS2 offers is as close as it can get to pen-and-paper RPG level of freedom transported in a videogame: every NPC is killable, everything can be stolen, companions will react on what you do based on their alignement and may even become your enemies (and so can do players you fplay with in multiplayer!), there are a myriad of different dialogue options suitable for any alignment you might want to role-play about, unique dialogues for each of the story NPCs, unique race-based ones, unique background-based ones, reputation based ones... so i mean, there are so many unique combinations and things that can happen that every play-through will be very different as far as interactions go, it's all about what you do and who you are, in this Larian did a wonderful job and very few other RPGs ever have been at the same level of depth in interactions.  Other than this, gameplay is pretty much straightforward and like any other classic RPG: explore a very vast world composed of 3 huge areas, plus all the dungeons and secret places of course, loot from randomly generated pieces of gear (except unique ones, those are always the same), fight a good variety of enemies each with its own features, and mind you enemies are very different from one another in this game so you will have to use new strategies a lot, solve quests in various ways depending on your alignment of just on how you feel like doing, but remember everything has some consequences.  If i was to explain in detail all the gameplay, this would be a very very long review and would go over the Steam word limit, so i tell you this: there have maybe been 2-3 RPGs in the whole history that match the depth this one offers, don't miss it.    Combat System  Combat in DOS2 is turn based and very much classic style. Every character starts with a fixed AP number each turn (excluding buffs and debuffs of course) and they are used for both movement and actions. There is no Mana in Divinity OS2, just cooldowns for all skills, and for some, a special type of energy is required.  The new mechanics Larian decided to introduce in OS2 are mainly about how armor works: in DOS2 there are two types of armor, Magical and Physical, which act like additional health bars and nullify any debuff or damage from that specific source (magical armor counters magical damage and magical debuffs, and so on) as long as it has 1 point at least. Once an Armor is depleted it can be regenerated with some skills and potions, but while down, Debuffs and negative statuses will always afflict the targeted character, there is no such thing as success percentage, it just matters if you have still Armor or not. The elimination of RNG this way is a quite clever gameplay change, but also comes with some issues we will discuss further on.  Other than that, rest assured, there are plenty of skills and fighting schools for all tastes, from warriors to healers to summoners, there are something like 150+ skills around to build your very custom characters the way you want.    Content  Immense. There is no way you can do everything in one play-through, you will have (and want to) play this game multiple times to get all the interactions, quests, and so on. To make just one play it can very well require above 85 hours, to complete the game 100%, can require more than 200.     Balancing  There just is one but quite serious issue with balancing: based on how the Armor mechanic is structured, it is logical to think that a party basing all its damage on either Physical or Magical would defeat enemies much quicker than splitting damage between example, 2 magical and 2 physical characters. And it is exactly how it is: a party based on just 1 type of damage is much more efficient, maybe too much, in combat and can defeat most enemies with much more ease than a ""standard"" party with some magical and some physical damage.    Challenge  Tactician difficulty, the hardest, is a serious challenge if taken without the proper respect. Badly built parties will be wiped with ease and requires planning, strategy in combat and experience. Some fights really impressed and got me on the brink of madness, let me tell you, and i play RPGs since twenty years! Luckily the unlimited and free re-spec at your base and adjustable difficulty will make the game beatable even for the less experienced.  ===   Technical Analysis   Graphics  Environments and art of cutscenes are really well done. Bear in mind this game does not make graphics one of its priorities, still the visuals are quite stunning in certain environments, particle effects are well done, character models are alright, armor and weapon models are made with particular care.  The world on DOS2 is vibrant and alive, the ccharacterization of the various environments and locations is marked very distinctively, it all contributes to the immersion feeling you already get from the roleplaying part.    Sound  It is to mention that Larian decided to voice act EVERY SINGLE DIALOGUE of this game, and there are a monstrous quantity. The voice acting is also good. This alone is a huge plus. other than this, the music and sound effects are at very good standards for an RPG, no really, they are good.    Performance  Performance is alright, the game is optimized well enough but can become heavy for low to mid end machines because it renders and makes all the characters in a whole area work together at the same time so it requires some computing power some machines might not have to run everything smooth.  Also when saving the game has some inexplicably huge frame drops.    Stability  DOS2 is not really unstable, it crashes sometimes, it is bound to happen, but rarely. There are no particular stability problems.    AI  Enemy AI is one of the best i've ever seen around. They will execute complex maneuvers to get the most efficiency out of just about everything. Think of this: enemies will get shoulder attacked to walls to avoid being back-stabbed if they are supports or ranged units and there is a rogue in the enemy team. How often you see this? Never. This is the level of AI i'm talking about, the same AI that curses you with healing is damage to bypass your shield and kill you with your own healing the next turn.  Prepare to be impressed.    Quality of Life  Inventory management and interfaces are generally good, but one thing is really bad: picked up new items will constantly clutter your hotbar and having to always clean it is a chore... there is a mod that solves this (blessed modding!) but as far as the vanilla game goes this is an issue.    Bugs / Issues  Sometimes enemies will just get stuck in combat if the pathfinding becomes too complex or if they are teleported / thrown / whatever in locations they cannot walk down from. In Act 3 some voice lines and dialogues are broken and do not work properly."

I was part of the early access and followed Larian Studio's developer updates every week.  I love how far this game has come and it's been an amazing ride to the final result.  They are continuing to update the game even now after full release to patch out some of the missed bugs which is reassuring.  Unlimited replayability, I've restarted at least 10-15 times now without finishing the game just because I figure something out, or I want to try something else.  Not because what I'm doing is getting stale, but rather that I'm just so curious about different outcomes that I'm compelled to go look at the alternative.   The multiplayer hop in/hop out style is super easy to learn, and I've already started working with the game master mode.  As a DnD GM, I can see the potential of divinity's game master mode, but I can tell it will take some learning and getting use to.  However I dont feel overwhelmed by any of the tutorials they have online, or any of the software.  Thanks for the awesome game."

One of the most epic experiences so far delivered in a fantasy world, giving us more control on builds to make - be anything you want! Combine your summoning skills with your tanking approaches, making yourself a strong opponent to those who dare to face you. Many quests to complete; each one of them has a good start and its up to you entirely how you would like the result to be. Turn based combat mechanics, along with some events that occur during the fight turn tides for both of sides, watch for a third invader! A bit of a rushed character development at the start, but you will get the gist of each easily the more you interact with them, all of them provide many benefits and great moments to witness your character engaging. Play with friends, play in-character during dialogues that can make the options wider in terms of gameplay and character benefits.

In this game all those minor/big issues I had with the series is gone.  One of my favorite things about this game is all the dialog options and more are available depending on your race, and tags. The random things you can do and play with your own style to pass are just amazing and leave me with a complete immersive feeling at all times. I'm still in the tutorial zone at nearly 9 hours because im taking it nice and slow while reading all that dialog. A somewhat early review but I've already noticed ALL my nitpicks from the first game have been addressed in this game.  Major improvements that I love from the last game: + More Dialog choices + Recruiting any new member gives you the choice to select their class allowing for a party of your choice as well + Selling an item worth a lot of money gives you quick reputation with traders + Killing someone in town away from everyone doesn't make the entire world hate you in this game + New Classes/Undead! + Very informative tutorial + New armor/movement/combat system that feels perfected for turn based + Inventory enhancements making it really easy to deal with all party members quickly + Co-op + 4 Players + Crafting"
1432,Lobster Dominance Hierarchy,30,2,0,2017-10-13,Recommended,364.3,"Great game! The Larian team has done it again. I'm happy for them, especially considering the studios history when they were taken advantage of in the past. I particularly like the shout outs and throwbacks to the DOS1, and I'm no where near done the game yet. If you are wanting a role playing strategy game where you actually interact with your companions, and who have their own motives/goals then this is the game for you.  Pros: - More skills. Dear God the old game was lacking in skill variety, really noticable late game. Good to see they improved this. - Diologue is great! - Lore is great! - Deatail in game world - Humor, and a at times snarky narrator - Different ways of solving a quest  Pro/Con: - Graphicks are amazing as ever, but lag the heck out of your computer when you are in the forest/city and not in a building - Crafting is more streamlined but waaaay harder when experimenting as it's less straightforward as DOS1. Good/bad I don't know.  Cons: - Still a little bugy/brocken quests. Nothing too serious as there is ushally a work around. But I came accross my first broken quest bug in Act 2, as in no way to start it as item didn't appear in inventory.

I'm happy for them, especially considering the studios history when they were taken advantage of in the past. I particularly like the shout outs and throwbacks to the DOS1, and I'm no where near done the game yet. If you are wanting a role playing strategy game where you actually interact with your companions, and who have their own motives/goals then this is the game for you.  Pros: - More skills. Dear God the old game was lacking in skill variety, really noticable late game. Good to see they improved this. - Diologue is great! - Lore is great! - Deatail in game world - Humor, and a at times snarky narrator - Different ways of solving a quest  Pro/Con: - Graphicks are amazing as ever, but lag the heck out of your computer when you are in the forest/city and not in a building - Crafting is more streamlined but waaaay harder when experimenting as it's less straightforward as DOS1. Good/bad I don't know.  Cons: - Still a little bugy/brocken quests. Nothing too serious as there is ushally a work around. But I came accross my first broken quest bug in Act 2, as in no way to start it as item didn't appear in inventory. Also the game sometimes crashes, so be sure to save often, especially if you open up a new window to google something.

I spent a lot of time learning the system and after many hours and a restart, I developed a team I was comfortable with. Experience is hard to come by in this game and most of the game you feel underpowered. Most of the battles are ambushes with no way to study the fight and plan, i.e. stealth is worthless because you can't reconnoiter and then set up for the fight, a standard for turn based games like Baldur's Gate, etc.   I managed to stomach all this until stupid quest mechanics that fail for capricious and unknown reasons. I stated experience was hard to come by with little chance to gain from quests? One quest fails because the quest givers ""fled"". No indication was given that this was a time based quest, no indication that this was even a possiblity. So after a day of game time, I came back to the quest, completed all the tasks, go back to where the quest givers ""were"" and got a notice that they fled, quest over...no experience."

91,mech,203,6,0,2017-10-13,Not Recommended,4.8,"Hmm... I really liked the first one and expected to like this one too, but something just feels off about it despite the obvious depth and quality and the adorable quirky characters.  I don't like how it controls at all. It's so easy to misclick and steal stuff or attack someone you didn't mean to or make the characters walk straight through the fire when you obviously didn't mean to either. I am also not a fan of the first area being overloaded with boss encounters. They tend to produce very random fights that lead to save scumming.   In fact, most of the encounters seem to be designed around save scumming and cheesy strategies, particularly in the ""Tactician"" mode. They are straight up unbeatable unless you know exactly what to expect from the encounter and you do things like precast spells, position your characters in a certain way for that specific encounter or put barrels around the area where you know the enemy is going to appear *before* you trigger it.  But what I really hate is the armor system. Every character has two armor bars, magical and physical. They are pretty much additional HP bars that absorb damage from physical and magical attacks correspondingly before you can affect the actual HP. This is fine on its own, however you can't apply any physical effects (stuns, knockdowns) while the target still has some physical armor and you can't apply any magical effects (slowed, burning etc.) while the target still has magical armor.  What that means is that for a good part of the fight you effectively can't use any skills and are forced to stick to basic attacks until the armor is gone. This system is easily the least fun armor system I've ever seen in an RPG."

Multiple branching pathways, full voice acting, and battle mechanics. The problem is, the game is simply not fun. On normal difficulty level, the game simply does not provide you with the means to empower your characters and overcome main questlines without resorting to spamming/exploiting game mechanics like pickpocketing and stealth. Virtually everyone I've heard playing this game has had to resort to the same strategy in act 1 and that is not good role playing mechanics if the level threshold has been set so high that the player cannot explore and act freely.  I get that this is not a game for casuals but at least developors like Bioware give players more content and choices through which to grow characters and have a fighting chance against higher tiered enemies.  The inventory system is beyond archaic, I've literally spent one third of this game having to sift through menus and bags. It's 2017, is it too much to ask for shared inventory and filter options?  And lastly the writing...it's okay, but again, for game getting all of these coveted perfect scores, I was expecting characters and story which were a bit less tropish.  I'm not saying Origina Sin 2 is a terrible game and as I stated before, you do get all of the features and promises as stated on the box which is rare in games these days. The problem is the game just turns in to a slog where you are constantly quick loading because of high level thresholds for quests in which you have NO means whatsoever to grind a little bit or do side quests to accomate for the difficulty.  It's very clear that a lot of work and care went into making this game, but ultimately it just isn't fun and relies too much on it's gimmicky battle systems."

She walked around the entire party, through a fire, and ran out of action points halfway back to the position.  You get my point.

Really instills my confidence and makes me feel real immersed in the role-playing game.  It goes beyond quests too though, tons of annoying?????? like I can't tell you HOW MANY TIMES I have clearly clicked the dialogue icon on a character in town only to have my character do some sort of phantom thieving attempt (no they're not sneaking, no they aren't click on items on the ground) and then I get attacked and have to reload.  Constantly having quicksave before literally every interaction in the game is NOT FUN.  But if you don't, what's even less fun is backtracking over parts of the game just because of some bullcrap glitchy behavior.  In battle it's mind numbingly infuriating as well.  So many times I will be trying to click attack on someone, and the dude will just run to the side of them and waste their action points doing a pointless move that turn into an attack of opportunity instead of you know, just attacking the ????ing person directly in front of them.  Also a lot of skills are just HORRIBLE with how the UI handles it.  How many ????ing times do I need to click an arrow in my hot bar before you freaking register it for me to fire?  Or how many times do I need to click drink a consumable to ????ing consume it?  Spoiler alert it's a completely random amount of times each time because somehow the UI is so buggy in this game that it ends up boiling down to rng to get your clicks to even register.  And there's also a ton of annoying things that just blow my mind.  The pathing in this game is a joke, try moving your party through an area with a lot of environmental hazards and tell me it went smoothly.  Then I can call you a blatent liar.  You're constantly getting story events triggered to the wrong character, usually never the person you want talking to the particular character to pass a persuasion attempt.  There's also other crap like randomly just losing items after cutscenes and not realizing till way too many saves later, and I could keep going on yada yada but I'm sure all the fanboys will defend this game to the death as being the most perfect game ever built event though it's impossible to go 5 minutes in the game without experience some sort of inconvenience due to bugs.  It would be a good game without the bugs and honestly I'll probably just suffer through it anyway because no one makes any good games these days and this is what I'm left with.  Yay."

If I had to summarize : +the game is beautiful, you can clearly see that the designers were inspired +the story of the firt act is really good   -the armor system is frustrating, since it encourages raw damage over control, at higher difficulty this really limits the number of good builds. A single point remaining in an armor (for you or your ennemy) can change the outcome of a combat, not really fun -for example ranger/sniper doesn't really work at higher difficulty (all ennemies have some sort of TP), and invocation is terrible -mages have basically to specialise in one scool to be efficient -two handed weapons is heavily favored for now, you can solo the game in tactical difficulty with a solo 2-handed warrior  -many things that worked in the first divinity original sin has been nerfed : crafting is more or less useless outside of runes, changing surfaces on the ground is sub-optimal (enemies like to put everything on fire, forget about poison and oil), etc  -initiative is only useful on one team number since there will be an alternance between your team and foes (hate the new system)  -the worst flaw of the game is the very weak act 3 (the last one) if you ask me (no spoil, but it is the worst of the three and the shortest) -act 3 has by far the most translation's errors of the three, it feels rushed (for example description in the place of the name of the object and name in the place of the description or two times the same sentences in dialogue, not really funny) -act 3 is also I think the one with the more bugs, at least it feels like it  So basically I am frustrated, it is quite a good game, but it feels not nearly as complete as the first. The end is rushed, the combat's mechanic is heavily damage oriented (forget about surfaces and such, it makes basically no damage and no control), and your life is basically useless, only armor really count (at least on tactical difficulty).  I don't know, it could have been so much better than I can't recommend it right now."
107,Arsenal,102,4,0,2017-10-15,Not Recommended,7,"This game has a lot of promise but falls quite short of the mark. It lacks a lot of polish to be a great RPG.  I played with three others and one of my biggest complaints is with the combat crowd control. There was multiple time where we would engage in combat and I would get stunned (no big deal) then right before my turn I would get knocked down, then get petrified. I would be unable to actually take a turn sometimes throughout the entire encounter. Combat like that where the player has ZERO control throughout an encounter destroys the gameplay.   Other gripe is with the camera and theft functionality, you are in the town and want to talk to an NPC but as you go to click on the NPC they move and you end up stealing a stick. Now youre left to deal with the guards and possibly having to reload."

But combat is what eventually will let me drop the game after about 20 hrs into it.  Two major issues I have with this game:  1. Side-quests are pretty much not optional. If you don't do every side-quest you can find and if you don't spend time fine-combing the environment for gear and XP (which takes considerable time), you will fail at the inevitable boss battles because you are underpowered. You can compensate a bit with clever use of skills and the environment, but at the end, you need to squeeze every bit out of the area you are currently in. In an RPG, I want to be an explorer and not an (XP) vacuum cleaner.  2. A lot of trial and error, especially in boss battles. For me, an RPG is supposed to tell a story. Battles should be challenging and give you a sense of reward and progression, but this should not rely on the players to trial and error through a fight, ideally with repeated dialogue that cannot be skipped. Throw in friendly NPCs with the AI of a rotten tomato that add an additional random factor to each fights progress and you end up with a time sink of enormous proportions.  There were other minor faults, like targeting in fights that could be overlooked, due to the interesting story and the engaging setting but sadly, I don't have the time to play Alexandar or Lady Vengeance fights over and over again until the stars of (friendly and hostile) NPC align in a way that the battle is won.  A lot of potential wasted, which is sad."

I spent most of the weekend playing and kept running into fights in which enemies were doing the most crazy?????? A lot of times I was simply reloading and reloading and reloading; Avoiding most fights until I did every possible sidequest to give me enough strength to get through the fights by the skin of my teeth.  I figured I was doing something wrong, but after some Googling, it turns out there's not much that can be done: Tactician mode gives a flat 50% increase to Armour, Health and Damage of enemies and has simply not been playtested all that well.

(side note, there is no reason to play the first game. While great, it task soooo long to get going that many players will bounce off it.) I didnt find the game or its systems confusing because of that.. maybe? Do not expect the game to tell you explicitly how to play. It isnt hardcore that you need to just work it out yourself. It will subttlely tell you how to play via the interface. My advice is take it slow. This is one of those games that you search everyone, read everything, talk to everyone. ? Save a lot.

The fact that every line of dialogue in the game is voice acted is impressive and almost always of impeccable quality. It really helps sells the games more emotional moments.  The turn based combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2 is all about interconnected systems. Fire ignites poison clouds or oil slicks. Rain puts out fire while ice can trip up enemies and allies alike. Necromancy can raise the dead or curse the living but can be countered by healing magic. Everything has a counterpoint of some type and a well coordinated exchange can take advantage of any number of systems to powerful effect. Unlike D&D games where your characters live or die by a lucky or unlucky roll of the dice, Divinity: Original Sin 2 does not make players worship at the alter of the RNG (random number generation) gods quite so much.  The longer you play the more complex the combat interactions. By the time you reach the mid to late game the list of abilities and spells at your disposal is vast. Even though each character chooses a class at the beginning of the game you can place points into whatever skill trees and abilities you want. The game encourages experimentation and since you can respec as much as you want once you leave the games first area there is nothing to stop you from making a character that is exactly what you want it to be.  The early game leans a bit too heavily on basic elemental exchanges like fire and ice, but eventually youll spend just as much time raising the dead, summoning demons, blinding your foes or charming people as you will tossing fireballs and ice shards. Because you have so many options when it comes to combat a lot of players have found ways to cheese the system. Some interactions were things the developers intended, but others are clearly breaking the game in ways they never considered. Patches post launch have addressed some of these issues, such as inflicting bleeding damage on an enemy and then transforming them into a chicken that runs itself to death. Or infinite damage loops that result from the interplay between buffs and attacks. That said the game encourages players to find innovative ways to tackle major obstacles. My personal favorite tactic it using teleport to push a tough enemy into the path of another powerful NPC and watch them tear each other to pieces.  Even with the ability to cheese the system at times and the plethora of options at your disposal, playing Divinity: Original Sin 2 on anything above Explorer difficulty can be really, really tough. Especially your first 10 hours with the game as you learn the intricacies of its many systems and options. The AI is smart and deadly and will throw every trick in the book at you. I restarted my campaign a half dozen times and invested almost 20 hours before I found a party composition and set of builds I felt complemented the way I wanted to play the game.  The game features a robust crafting system. Dozens of spells, potions, meals, enchantments and items can be crafted. You can learn recipes from books or experiment on your own to learn new ones. The one area where crafting falls short is weapons and armour.  Freedom and experimentation is at the very heart of what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing. It applies not only to combat but how you tackle the games many quests and challenges. Almost everything has multiple avenues of approach and a myriad of solutions. The games main story quests give you a direction to aim yourself at but how you get there is completely up to you.  However this is also where Divinity: Original Sin 2s biggest problem rears its head. The game is terrible at informing you if you are on the right track in completing certain quest lines and is often vague, to the point of maddening frustration, when it comes to giving you any sort of hint when it comes to what you should do next. On the one hand it is nice that the game does not hold your hand as if you were a child who never played an RPG before, but on the other it would be nice to know why a quest that seems to be over isnt. Sometimes you are not sure if you just missed something or if the quest line is just bugged because you approached it in a way the developers never expected or tested for.

48,Daniel,180,3,0,2017-10-16,Not Recommended,60.8,"At first, the game is captivating. But if you are looking into a more challenging difficulty, it becomes etxremely tedious to find viable builds that survive fights. Because of the mind-boggling decision of physical and magical armor, having a party of fighters and mages makes zero sense. Why should your mages you chew through 300 magic armor, when your fighters already melted down their physical armor, and vice versa. So you either go all fighters or all mages. And because of this, only a fracture of what is possible also makes sense. And I am not talking about over-optimization, I am talking about the minimum that is requried to have fun in combat. Unfortunately, the more you progress in the story, and the more spells you unlock, the more tedious the search of a good build becomes. And then make this times two or four, depending on how many party members you have.  But balancing is not only messed up in character creation and armor system. Thievery in Act I is the difference between making Honour Mode (the highest difficulty) unbeatable without, or a walk in the park if you start stealing armor and weapon from every vendor you come across. Another skill that feels like cheating is Teleportation, making it mandatory - together with Thievery.  I don't see the point in having literally hundreds of possibilites, where only a handful are actually fun. It only makes it tedious to find those exact combinations and not suck in every fight. And I got tired looking for them after Act I."

I am not hating on the game, nor attacking, but expressing that I would not recommend it in its current state. Although, if you have any information that may compliment this game/solutions to included problems below, then I'll be more than happy to test those and alter this review accordingly  Now, you may expect the game to be flawless now that it's officially out of Beta, but there are some things completely askew; content is missing.  And, to some, that content can be extremely valuable if you like to immerse yourself into the world of Divinity.  Voice: Dialogue is missing in particular parts of the game with certain NPCs - even their portraits are missing.  There are sections within the game where the Narrator will say one thing, but the text will say otherwise.  (Narrator will say 'she/her' when the dialogue states 'he/his') During party conversations, one person's dialogue will be skipped completely and instantly followed up/replaced by another party member.  (In my experience, Ifan's voice would not be there, but Beast's voiceline would be spoken)  Loading Times/Party Play: Now you may have seen a lot of people complaining about this - but they are right; loading times are quite tacky as of now.  During Fort Joy, loading times were bearable - with a load time of roughly 3-5 minutes.  Although, as you progress, the duration gets seemingly longer; with times fluctuating anywhere between 9-20 minutes.  Keep in mind that loading times vary if you are playing solo, compared to multiplayer. Conclusion/TL;DR: Great game with a lot of potential.  It was released from Beta, in my opinion and experienece, too early.  If you are okay with missing content such as voicelines and misguided/incorrect text, accompanied by lengthy loading times, then this may be for you.

303,IronSnak3,343,5,0,2017-10-16,Not Recommended,52.9,"Very disappointed with this one. Worse than the first in almost every way. Larian basically took a solid turn-based RPG and made it into a JRPG.  The combat system is broken thanks to the new armor system, which makes characters immune to effects until the armor is completely worn down. This makes battles less fun and less tactical, as the only thing you can do in the first few rounds is chip away at armor.  The AP system has changed as well, instead of the 10-20 APs in the first game now there's only 4-6. The final version also saw some adjustments to abilities and AP costs - while the early access offered some variety (e.g. magic touch attacks compensating for limited range with low AP cost), now almost everything costs 2 AP.  So it's three actions per round and that's basically it, no matter what those actions are. Stats no longer affect the availability of action points, so those super-agile characters will move just as fast the lowliest brutes.  It's nearly impossible to win a fight the first time you attempt it without cheesing it one way or another. But the devs admitted they left the exploits in specifically so players would use them. Yeah, no thanks. Keeping a conversation going while everything around is burning to hell and back is just plain stupid.  Characters and their presentation are so cliched, it's like a 5 year old came up with them. Save for the undead companion, there's no originality whatsoever, nothing you haven't seen before anywhere you look. Walk up to a possible companion to say hi and oh look, you're railroaded into having a knife to your throat in the friggin' dialogue because the character you're talking to is supposed to be badass or something and the only way you can get out is by the equivalent of peeing yourself while reciting bad poetry.  The first D:OS had a lot of cliches, sure, but it thrived on them because it acknowledged them as silly and they became light-hearted fun. This one tries to take itself too seriously and falls flat.  The story is boring. I stopped caring as soon as I left the Fort. Immersion is completely gone. It's what happens when you pair a completely over-the-top combat system with what's supposed to be a serious storyline (yet is so mind-numblingly shallow). They just don't work well together. I can't get invested into the world and the woes of the characters when the next minute I'm fighting boulder-slinging crocs.  Dialogue, while it uses the dialogue interface, is roughly 50% (or what feels like 50%) the narrator intervening with some useless description of what a character is doing, or looks like. The 5 year olds that wrote the script definitely never heard of 'Show, don't tell'.  GM mode had a lot of promise, but it's basically just a limited create-your-own-adventure mode. I was hoping for more control over the main campaign; having something to start from rather than building from scratch wouldn't have been as tedious. The very few assets provided are just that - very few.  Quests are plentiful, but very improperly paced. You'll basically have tens of quests cluttering up the journal before you have a chance to complete one of them. Some quests and encounters are timed, meaning that the NPCs involved either die or move on before you have a chance to interact with them, missing out on precious xp that you have no other way of getting. Because there's no options to grind some xp, even a little, you're forced to minmax and metagame as much as possible to the point where it becomes a chore.  Also on quests, it seems like the game is designed to be played with one character only. Get a quest from an NPC and you can usually progress it only with the same character that initially spoke to the NPC if the quest involves speaking with the same NPC at some point, as having another companion do the talking will get regular greetings as if it's the first time you met the NPC.  Inventory and item management is carried over from the first game and suffers from the same problems. It's tedious, clunky, slow, and frustrating, especially with no way to tell which items you'll need for quests later on and which you can safely lose. If anything, D:OS2 has more items laying about, which wouldn't be a bad thing at all if it didn't mean you have to spend hours just managing your inventory.  The trait system from the first game is gone, replaced by tags. Sure, you can gain a couple of said tags through regular gampley, but it's nowhere as dynamic and rewarding as in D:OS. Tags are now mostly just an extra dialogue option that rarely gives better results than the default ones.  On the upside, the game does look good, equipment is more varied than in its predecessor, the levels are fun to explore, with many secrets and hard-to-spot areas laying about. Combat is fun, only nowhere near as fun as it was in the first game, and there's actually less of it this time around. Having multiple races to play with is definitely interesting, though the elves' corpse eating ability is squandered on meaningless dialogue - while at first it seems like great attention to detail, you'll quickly tire of the endless vague descriptions of past lives of unnamed, irrelevant NPCs. Yeah, I'm so disappointed by this title that even when trying to think of positives I end up discussing the negative aspects of the same mechanic I was trying to praise.  Save your $$$, wait for a sale."

If you're planning on playing co-op I don't think you're going to enjoy It very much with the ridiculous loading time. It increases and grows as you play with friends, It's absolutely ?????ing stupid to sit through a 5-20 minute loading screen everytime you want to reload a save.  Let's say you make a mistake, your whole party dies and you'd obviously want to reload to a previous save where you can reposition yourself better to win the fight, load a savefile wait like 20 minutes for you and your buddy to load in and play.  This in my opinion makes multiplayer/co-op no longer fun, loading times shouldn't be this long just to play a game together.  Oh and not to mention there's alot of missing voice lines, images, and misspelt dialouges, I've screenshotted a few which proves it, I don't understand how Larian Studios can release this and say It's out of early access, while there's a ton of missing features as mentioned earlier.  If you plan to play this game solo and you don't mind a few missing features then go right ahead, you won't have much of a problem.  But If you plan to play this game with a friend, expect long loading times that will increase over time, I wouldn't recommend this until they fix the loading times.  In my opinion this game still feels like It's in early access, give Larian Studios some time before purchasing.  Overall I think this game is amazing and way better than the first Divinity: Original Sin, don't get me wrong but the only thing that puts me off Is the loading times.  EDIT: I provided some screenshots but be WARNED that they contain minor spoilers throughout the game.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1168500010 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1164957572 "
636,Idi Amin,195,3,2,2017-10-16,Not Recommended,40.2,"A very fun and improved game over the original but currently there are overwhelming flaws in the game that make the game unenjoyable.  -Use BattleStomp with the spear of Bracchus Rex which ends up petrefying the unit who used battle stomp. -Units showing they will be hit by an AOE attack, completely whiffing on said attack and hitting an ally that was shown to be out of the aoe. -Tactics largely useless as the game has awful pathfinding making some routes unreachable despite enemies traveling by these very same routes. -Enemies 2 stories down can attack your units in melee -Youre units who can attack with ranged weapons can't get LOS of units below them while units those very same units have no problems attacking you -Enemies always having the best positions and always being outnumbered -Meta being the ""skill"" of this game, knowing every good item is at, ignoring roleplaying to kill npcs for their items only -Endless bugs and skill bugs. -Autosave is abysmall, I was playing with a friend in the first 20 minutes there was 8+ autosaves, I play for 5+ hours in my SP game and realize the game didn't autosave once -always facing a upwards battle, enemies will always have more magic armor, physical armor and health then you, with more AP too boot. -They will always spawn in advantageous postions where you do not  The game ultimately relies on cheesing the game and its mechanics more then it does skill, which is the largest complaint of the game.  I win by abusing the AI and funneling the enemy then actually using skills and the magic and physical armor system only increases that by making you focus on dps to remove them vs utility or support classes. I could go on but those who understand what I'm speaking of will know to stay away until the game is properly polished and fixed, others I'm sure will defend the game with accusations of ""not being gud, and git gud""  Its a fun game that's held back by awful mechanical and buggy mechanics."

228,Brian (The Schmaltzy Cynic),888,16,10,2017-10-19,Recommended,179.3,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the making of legends in modern games: A fully-voiced acted, superbly written 40-50 hour journey, tailored for both single-player or four-player local/online cooperation, with as much reasons for replayability to shape the narrative and to bite further into its sense of challenge as the amount of genuine affection and RPG craftmanship made into this one game. When you feature dynamic instrument options for battle music in a character creator and even after a hundred hours you still have more to learn and to explore in the world, you know you have stumbled across a game unlike no other.   This is also ignoring the extra features made for the community to expand the life of DOS2 with a Pen & Paper style mode, Game Master, and a dev-kit of modding tools to create your own adventures that harkens back to the glory days of Neverwinter Nights. There is simply too much care crafted into the soul of this game that it is simply impossible not to fall in love with it, even if the gameplay can pull some cheap punches for challenge leftover from the previous title. At its worst, DOS2 can be so mired by its hurdles that it makes the pursuit even more tempting to overcome. Unlike the original, this diamond in the rough illuminates all traces of imperfection the more you become lost in its brilliance.  Its Not What You Say That Counts; Its What You Do Before I begin to address the issues, the writing techniques of DOS2 need to be given their praise. Unlike the original which made itself into a buddy comedy experience to a fault for its abundance of comedy and non-cooperative dialogue, DOS2 keeps some of the buddy chatter for only multiplayer and the game focuses more on second-person dialogue to create the amount of choices and role-playing opportunities. Instead of creating lines for every character in every scenario, the dialogue creates the illusion of what you want to say and how you say it by smartly giving you options written as commands.   If you are not sure what I mean, then think of the situation this way: The writers can write as much options as they need to convey all available options without having to take into consideration of the characters tone. Instead of writing out a angered, elated, depressed, etc. response, the narrator only has to give you options like a choose-your-own adventure book. (Ex. *Assume you know what he is blabbering on about.*) This method adds far more role-playing options without breaking immersion of your character, and it adds far more vivid choices that can affect the moment.  Even if you prefer a character with all voice-acted lines, DOS2 also offers Origin characters which are the companions of the game that you can play with their own backstories and voice-actors. You still can make choices but the character is more grounded than custom ones, and unlike the original the companions or players you tag along with have a greater sense of companionship because of this dialogue system and the story being focused on deciding whether to stick together or to divide amongst yourselves. This is a beautiful system that caters to all preferences in RPGs that does not weaken the storytelling nor the role-playing of the game, and its a system I hope more RPGs include this method to save money on voice-acting every single line.     Call Me Unreliable& Well, Im None Too Clever; I Just Adore You Now lets discuss the biggest issue with DOS2 that stems from the original, the seemingly unpredictable difficulty until you learn the game from the inside out. After nearing 200 hours, starting from Explorer and reaching the modded Infernal Difficulty, my experience has become a well-rounded experience, and this statement is still true. This is why I think its important to revisit this section to delve into the discussion once more.  Compared to the first game, DOS2 has a more creative approach to difficulty than rigid standards of what it defines as challenge. It is by no means an easier game than the first as Fort Joy is the first major obstacle to overcome due to resource scarcity and the importance of synergy with your builds; however, there are modifiers to enhance the challenge to suit the player. These things include making undead characters who can only heal by poison, which isnt as much of a problem as it sounds as you can make interesting undead teams, straying from traditional party set-ups like having no main healer, or by adding more/less characters to the experience. (The ironic twist is that a two-man Lone Wolf party is MORE capable than a seven-man team on the same difficulty.) All of these modifiers are creative means for players to create a game as difficult as they want and still retain its sense of balance.  This balance is largely the result of all the new changes to combat. For starters, the armor sy""em is completely reworked into physical and magic armor, which helps divide enemies by targeting their weaker armor. This also prevents stun-lock skills like battering ram to be abused without removing all the physical armor. As a result, its more important to make every party member have decent equipment and weaponswhich in a strange way makes adding more companions more difficult with less good armor to go aroundas enemies often will use are"

This game is like a cross between Baldor's Gate, Wrold of Warcraft, and Skyrim. Except the graphics pale in comparison to Skyrim, and the UI and logic in the game are not as good as WoW.   There are some simple bugs STILL in this game. For example, when your party members are separated far apart and/or on completely different maps, you can still share inventory items with them as if they were right there next to you! Another bug is that sometimes main characters in the story act as if they've never seen you before, when you in fact have met them many times. Add to that the sometimes extreme difficulty finding even the simplest tools (such as a shovel) needed to complete the story, and very little guidance in the game for how to create and acquire better items other than a stick with a nail on it, or twigs and string for a bow, and you got yourelf a game not nearly worth the money you paid for it!

I will just be critical of this game and probably talk more about the things I dislike as opposed to the things I do, everyone has already gushed enough about this game. I think it is one the best RPGs of this generation, but it's not perfect.  Extremely open ended, with lots of possible ways to approach a given objective (encounter/quest etc.) which opens up a lot of possible playstyles/roleplay choices. This however, does introduce a lot of broken sh*t, the quest log being one glaring example and I have broken a few enounters by doing X when I should have done Y first  for some arcane reason .  Characters are well written, although all the fantasy cliches are there, they are subversive to those tropes in places and each main character has a nicely rounded theme/character arc. Writing in general is nuanced and mature, serious in tone but not lacking in humour a la classic Larian. Main Quest has some interesting ideas and dynamics, but kinda falls apart by the end of act 3 imo  (Act 3 feels very endgame, only for the main villian to pull out a dues ex machina 'lolz gotcha!', only played up to the begining of act 4, so who knows, might redeem itself in the end)    Combat is a little different from Original Sin 1 because of the inclusion of the Armour system. It prevents turn 1 CC deciding battles, and I think it makes you think a bit more tactically during the initial turns but overall I think the system needs some improvements as your mindset going into each battle remains mainly the same, and it also makes some builds pretty trash (tanks, phys/ele hybrids etc). I like saving throws in D&D, a hybrid system where, for example, armour values influenced saving throws would work better imo.  I am not a fan of the character development, way too much number creep (going to the next levels means each piece of gear is instantly outclassed), gear isn't really that intersting, just get some +stats and maybe a free non-unique skill. Vitality/armour/damage scale way too high and picking stats comes down picking whatever gives you the damage multipliers for your skills. Not really engaging or meaningful. Thankfully these points can be easily solved by using mods, but mods don't influence my opinion on the design philosophy of the base game.  Tactician mode is kinda busted, maybe I need to git gud, maybe my fun Nice BuildsTM do not abuse mechanics enough. Classic mode gets too easy, too quickly. Woe is me.  Mods pls fix   Overall though, this is on par with some of the best in the genre, and Larian should be commended for their ethical kickstarter/development process. The director has alluded to extra content in the future and has admitted to some flaws so thumbs up again."

While the combat and stats are simplified and dumbed down, that alone wouldn't be enough for me to give the game a negative review.

They don't feel like people at all, none of them seem to have any real issues they care about, even the NPCs with you that have life changing events over their heads give up on them with a single easy persuasion check. It doesn't help either that half of the NPCs you meet seem to be smug and insulting of the party, not in a funny way either, but in a ""Hey guys look at this cool guy who'll guide you through the game"" kind of way. It doesn't help that a massive number of characters are introduced by showing you up in text, such as putting a knife to your throat or invading your space in some other way. In short, the npcs in this game seem to drive it instead of the players, and many seem to have a self important mary sue vibe. It really killed my ability to get in to the game as a whole."

667,Timmiii,83,2,1,2017-10-20,Not Recommended,188.9,"I there was a ""luke warm sligthtly approve"" thumbs up, I?d give it that. But no, so it has to be thumbs down  First off, I played D:OS 1 and loved it. Great challenging game with many choices, not only in combat but also in the path you wish to proceed forward.  That being said, D:OS 2 offers pretty much the same mechanichs af it?s predecessor, but only harder, much much harder. Allow me to break it down, what is good and what is not if you are concidering bying this game   Overpowered enemies   I don?t know what Larian was thinking, but lvl progress doesn?t seem to match the enemies you face. I play on classic mode, and several times when encountering an enemy that is your lvl, you get wiped out completely. Your whole party, usually within 2 turns. This is immensly frustrating, and you spend many hours desperately looking for for lighter quests to complete, so you can advance and gain the upper hand. Most enemies can only be defeated if you are 1 lvl above. If that?s your thing, punching keyboard and ragequitting, this is the game for you   Broken quests   Many times I have hovered over and around the same quest looking for enemies or items that were nowhere to be found, and once you have completed a particular quest, it is still indicated on your map as still active. Hours have been wasted waking around trying to solve already solved quests   Movement and turnbased fights   Your party memebers move around like they are complete ???????. Most of the time they stop somewhere random and don?t keep up, or they see a trap and dive head first right into it. Happens more or less all the time. The turnbase fight could be alot of fun it they turnbased system were in any way fair, but it usually goes like this: First enemy stuns you and all your companions, drain all you armour, goes into overpowered mode and takes away half of your energy. Next up is the enemies companions who do exactly the same and you are molested very quickly   SJW enviroment (at times)     So - We live in a time where political correctness is of the essence, and the disease of SJW has infested gaming all together. For instance, a dialogue can go as following in DO:OS 2 (I exagerated a bit, to enhace it?s meaning):  - Ifan: ""So, Beast, we made it this far. I?m glad I made this journey with you. Good to have you around""  - Beast: *Smiles suspiciously* ""Yes, me too. Say, have you ever been with someone of your sex?""  Beast gets undressed, a major erection emerges before you, he pulls you close   1.) You push him away 2.) You smile akwardly and try to talk your way out of it 3.) You let him penetrate you 4.) You french kiss him, and see what happens happens  Now, if you are gay, that?s fine and I geniuenly hope that you are happy with you self and your partner, but why does have to in a game in such a poor and badly written manner? If at all? We all know why it is there, if not the game would be hammered for being homophobic and what not. Could we dial it down a notch? Pls  I wanted this game to be more than it is, I wanted it to be the game of the year. I its good, or I would say 50% fun/50% frustration. I am almost at the end of the game, and I can?t seem to make it the final strecth. I just don?t care anymore, too much frustration has killed it for me  Overall 6.5/10 - Just approved"

32,AKatarzynaK,681,152,4,2017-10-21,Recommended,114.5,"This is without a doubt one of the best RPGs I have ever played and after completing it I can honestly say it has secured its place among my top favorite games of all time.   When beginning the game you have the option of creating your own character or choosing from one of several premade characters, each with their own unique backstories and questlines. I highly recommend going this route as these characters and their quests are very well written and interesting. I found myself extremely invested in my main character (Lohse) and what would become of her and her companions. It's also really interesting witnessing the members of your party, each with their own motivations and biases, try to work together while also clashing as they look out for their own best interests. Each character is so well written and perfectly voice acted that it really helped make what is already such an immersive game feel even more alive. The dialogue is great, whether it be the main characters or random NPCs, it really feels like everyone has their own unique personality.  The gameplay is incredibly fun, and I really can't think of the last time I had such a hard time putting down a game. You are given a lot of freedom, leaving it entirely up to you how you choose to progress throughout the world. There are often numerous ways to complete one task, depending on just how creative or good/evil you want to be. To add to this, the choices you make actually have consequences, and sometimes the line between what is right and what is wrong might not be so clear. So you will sometimes find that a decision you made might come back to haunt you in one way or another. I loved this and it was really cool seeing how some of the choices I made previously came to have a much wider impact than I had originally imagined.  The turn-based combat system is really well done and there are lots of ways in which you can get creative and use the environment to your advantage. Each battle is well designed and interesting, with each type of enemy presenting their own unique strengths and weaknesses. You have to really put some thought into exactly how you design your group, providing for a nice amount of strategy both in and out of battle. If you find that you have messed up your build there is an option to respec, something which I think most of us can appreciate for its ability to save us a lot of wasted time.  It is also worth mentioning that there are quite a few options as far as difficulty. I did my first playthrough on Classic, which is the default difficulty, and found it to be perfect for me. There were a few fights which I struggled on, but anytime I faced such a roadblock I found that all I needed to achieve victory was to simply reevaluate my strategy. Personally I love just how rewarding of a feeling this can be, and I look forward to doing future playthrough on the harder difficulties. However if you're someone who is looking for less of a hassle, you will be happy to find that the lower difficulty, Explorer, will allow you to simply enjoy the ride without any frustration.  The quests are extremely fun and varied, some of which require solving puzzles, riddles, or getting a bit more creative with your abilities and items. One thing I really loved about the quest system is that it doesn't hold your hand, meaning that unlike some RPGs that basically give you a GPS tracker showing you exactly where you need to go, this game tends to just point you in a general direction and expect you to figure it out on your own. Now if this is offputting to you, please know I am speaking as someone with a truly awful sense of direction. I had a ton of fun with this and found that getting lost while trying to find where I needed to go to next provided for some of my favorite moments. Some of the random encounters you come across as you explore are the most surprising and rewarding experiences in the game.   The attention to detail is truly incredible and the world really feels so alive. Even areas that at first glance appear to be devoid of life might have something hidden. Especially with the pet pal ability, which allows you to talk to animals, or spirit vision which allows you to see/speak to ghosts, you'll find that if you look close enough there is no shortage of things to be seen or done. And to top this all off the soundtrack is incredible, providing the perfect music to accompany you on what is truly an epic journey.  The universe that Larian have built here is absolutely astounding and they managed to pack so much into this game that it's honestly a bit overwhelming at times. Between all of the characters and their questlines, the decisions you have to make throughout the game, and the sheer size of the world, it's truly impossible to take it all in on just one run. Speaking as someone who rarely plays games a second time, I'm already gearing up for my second trip into Divinity Original Sin 2 and imagine I'll be making even more eventually.   Now that I've ranted and raved about just how much I adore this game I must point out really the only negative thing I have to say about it, and that is just how buggy it can be. During the course of my 111 hour playthrough I ran into a number of bugs, ranging from mildly annoying to gamebreaking. The biggest one, of course, being the gamebreaking bug which made it impossible for me to enter into a room you need to use to begin the final quest. In order to get around this I had to get a bit creative and basically stack items until I could get one of my characters to glitch into said room, then allowing the rest of my party to teleport to me. While I am obviously pleased that I was able to get past this annoying bug, I can't help but be frustrated that such a problem would even exist in the first place. For as much as I love this game some of the bugs I faced really took away from my overall enjoyment and I truly hope Larian will patch them as soon as possible. Of course I'm sure there are those who played the game without facing bugs, but it doesn't change the fact that I was unfortunate enough to encounter them and that some of you might as well.   Overall I truly love this game and believe it deserves all of the praise it is getting. As I mentioned, my one and only complaint are some of the bugs I encountered. While frustrating, such issues can easily be fixed through a patch. And it does speak to just how captivating I found this game to be that I continued to press on despite these issues. There is absolutely no denying that this was a game crafted with a lot of love, and so I have complete faith that Larian will continue to be very active in it post release. If you're on the fence than I suggest you wait a bit to buy, but I imagine it won't take long for these issues to be fixed. For 45 Euro I managed to get one of the most amazing gaming experiences I have ever had and I encourage everyone who is interested to give it a try. This game is a masterpiece, plain and simple."

Going from soundtrack, to gameplay, and the story.  Soundtrack : The music in the game is really good, the orchestral OST really makes the game, many locations and fight have fitting music for what they are. It's good to listen to the game OST even outside the game or use it in Roleplay sessions, I cannot add anything more to be honest... The soundtrack is truly great.  Gameplay : The gameplay is really good, I love turn-based combat in games and it is very refined combat from the first game. You can use envinronment in your advantage, set up poison and during the combat light it on fire, set up barrles of oil and poison ready to be destroyed and many more things which I really love about the combat. The gameplay itself is very nice, camera movement is nice and you can move it around however you want, the dialogue menu is pretty good. My only gripe was inventory but it's because it was mess thanks to my own fault (but auto sort button is pretty nice)  Story : It's good, great, awesome. The dialogues are very well written, the NPCs are ""alive"", it feels like they are real people, the talking with animals and them giving you quests is great addition to the game. Companions are also well written making it like you are adventuring actually with real people, with their own problems, agendas, interrupting talks sometimes to add something of their own. The game had as well really interesting plot twists in some places.  I can wholeheartedly recommend the game, as it become one of my favorite RPG of all time, among Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Planescape Torment"

The world is compelling and the story involved without being excessively convoluted (looking ar you, Pillars of Eternity).   That said, the amount of bugs in this game are unacceptable. There are major issues with in-game sounds. Sometimes you get no notifications for a while then everything you have done in the last 20 minutes shows up on screen at the same time. Many quests are bugged and uncompletable. Even more annoyingly, recently Saheila and the Tinker have joined my party, blocking me from accessing two of my real party members and completely breaking my game. For a hilarious account of this, read Saheila the Game Breaker at https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/734psx/saheila_the_game_breaker/ .

The only design that attracts me is the wide variety of skills BUT before your intention to use those elemental flamboyant AOE to wipe minor slimes really take effect your teammates are already dead in the friendly fire. Soon after the 2 hour refund time was past I was forced to restart with 2 Lonewolf elemental mages. The world was clearer after that. Definitely overpowered. But there is no wandering monster to fight at all. I have to massacre towns to get to use a cycle of skills combination. Really want to restart with other 4 characters in a pure physical team but back to the above 2 points, overwhelming reading and quests, I even find my research papers more attracting.

35,aphex,192,34,3,2017-10-22,Not Recommended,88,"This is the first review I've bothered to write about a game in my 14 years of being on steam. I'm taking the time because I'm extremely frustrated with the incredible dive in quality and game play experience the game takes after the opening chapter.  I'm voting this game down because, while I completely love the oepning zone I've found the rest of the game to be frustrating and tedious. At the start of this game you'll feel like exploring and experimenting with everything you come across because there's so much you can do. But in the second section the randomness in difficulty and scaling will force you to become tactical and calculated. You will feel that exploration is punished by mobs outside your viable level range, but you won't be provided with clear targets to persue. What was beautiful and fun becomes tedious and boring very quickly.  Combined with the many, many, dialogue and quest bugs, this makes the game far less than appealling.  Before going into details I want to add that this isn't about the difficulty. If I respec my characters in certains ways, take advantage of min/maxing, and use tried and true tactics while avoiding out of reach fights, then the game is easy to continue with. But everything about this world screams that I shouldn't have to do that! That there should be some way to afford my skill books *without* needing to steal. That I should be able to make a persuassion check without full min/max into the required stats. None of that is the case - after Fort Joy you are severely limited in scope for experimentation by the systems of play.  I loved Fort Joy! I thought about the game all the time, ways to do things, stuff to try. And just like that, almost instantly, I'm completely hating it. Tells you a lot about where the time an effort was spent.   The details below...  Fort Joy is great - the game feels polished and balanced. Some fights are hard and some are easy but playing on Tactician level difficulty I felt like it was a tough, punishing, but ultimately fun experience. After Fort Joy the game takes a huge dive in polish while the difficulty level becomes very randomised.  There are fights which seem absolutely natural to the flow of the zone, and which are initiated by dialogue (so you don't just avoid them) which are stupidly more difficult than the large boss battles you've just played through. To be clear, these are little plebs you're fighting, the same types of guys you fought on Fort Joy, but suddenly they are 3-4 levels higher than you can possibly be when entering the zone. This is such poor game design. I'm literally pointed to find these character as my main quest only to enter a fight that I have to completely cheese to get through, and it has no story implication. It's not a special fight. It's just some normal dudes, who can kill any of your characters in one turn.  It's not just one fight either. There's level 8 fights right next to 8*lvl 11 mob fights and no discernable way for you to see the danger coming. Again, this is bad game design - you're being led down one path and being flogged for it.   If there were pointers, or there was an indication of where you *should* go, then I'd be less frustrated. But the game offers you nothing. The Journal is almost useless - in fact it was like this in Fort Joy as well but the quests themselves were more clear cut and controlled, giving a sense of exploration and freedom while also not throwing you far out of your depth unless you wanted that. Sometimes I did, and got smacked for it occassionally, but that was just. In Reaper's Coast there is no such sense of restriction, you just have to blunder around blindly and hope.   Part of the problem with this is the level scaling. This has been detailed elsewhere but the difference in levels can have absolutely huge implications on your ability to fight. Again, this in itself isn't a problem, but when you combine it with a lack of information and where you *could* go then it's painful.  Other problems post Fort Joy:  Terrible scaling of dialogue checks - I can win none of them and I hear this is a common problem. For a game that encourages you to try different things, it also absolutely enforces min/maxing of your characters to succeed. Which makes the required stats for roles to be successful very stupid.  Economics - Right now you essentially need to use pickpocket to be able to get most of the skills you require. You also require Barter min/max on one character, and Lucky on another character helps a lot. Without those three things you cannot expect to have decent equipment after Fort Joy. Given that skills also cost money you get punished also from the amount of fun you have, not just the difficulty from lower level equipment. Interestingly enough even killing vendors and everyone doesn't give you that much gold - you really have to gimp the economic system if you want access to skills. Costs also, by the way, scale poorly with levels.  Polish and Bugs - there are a lot of bugs in dialogue, quests and logs in this section. There were quite a few in Fort Joy too but now it's just silly. Almost every quest has some strangeness too it and most look so easy to fix. You honestly have to wonder how few people Larian had QC'ing a product which is this ambitious.   In the end I really want to love this game but I've just gotten so bored in the new zone. Everytime I try something exciting I just get shut down by horrible scaling and mechanics. Fort Joy encouraged exploration and experimentation, Driftwood just encourages you to cheese and tactical perfection. I feel like I'm playing a tactical game and not a role playing game suddenly.

As others have said, the last city in the game is badly setup and a frustrating letdown.  Way too many bugs and too much slowdown, especially in the last third of the game.  Worst optimization I have seen.  It's sad, since the combat and story were very strong in the beginning.  This game started at about a 9 or 10 and ended somewhere around a 5.

But however flawed it may be, the combat system is just as much fun as it was in the first game, with the interesting addition of physical and magical armor.   The first part of the game shows there's multiple diverse ways of completing objectives. However, there's little point to it because you're going to have to do every single one of them, or you'll be under-leveled going into the next section.   In all, it's a frustrating experience, even more so because the combat system at its core is very fun. Experimenting with skill combinations and builds is great. It just could've been so much more enjoyable if the pacing was a little better and the difficulty spread out a bit more."
212,Beansprout Chace,96,5,2,2017-10-22,Not Recommended,19,"The new combat system is horrendous. Enemies large amount of physical/magic armor on top of health allow them to walk through tactically placed status effects without effect. Enemies have high amounts of AP, less cooldown, and other cheats to straight up overpower your well thought out strategies. The game appears to only allow for a small subset of party combinations to be successful. Having little to no physical/magical armor in the beginning of the game is a huge handicap in combat.  The jump from classical to tactician modes is a huge leap. And it forces the player to cheese to even have a chance of passing. Expect a lot of reloads even on classical difficulty.   The random loot system often gives poor reward you end up vendoring.  A definite step down from the first. Wait six months to a year before buying this game."
277,Shroom,361,3,0,2017-10-22,Not Recommended,60,"I would give this game 3 stars on a scale of 1 to 5.  The good: The game itself is pretty fun. If you have read anything about it you will know that it's a solid old school RPG that is relatively unforgiving and certainly not noob friendly. That is part of why it's a good game. You don't get quest markers saying ""go here next"" or tons of help with how to build or equip your characters. You simply need to figure it out. That is a large part of what makes it a good game. There are literally tons and tons of successful ways to play the game (and almost as many ways to nerf yourself) which is a large part of the fun.   The game itself is great. The game is totally voice acted which makes for a nice touch in the modern age of voice-overed RPGs. The combat is very strategic and makes you think (unless you're on super easy mode). The quests are not gimmes and you need to think through what you're doing AND the sequence you do quests in. There are lots of ways to play the game which is probably the best thing about divinity 2 overall.  The bad: Bugs. Bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs and did i mention bugs? There are several essentially game breaking bugs that will??????you off to no end.  The first annoying bug is the ""half my team goes into combat bug"". You waltz into an area and bang, a fight starts. You take a quick glance at the top of your screen to see in which sequence you will get to take actions only to realize that 2 or sometimes even 3 of your 4 characters are not even involved. wtf? They're literally standing RIGHT NEXT to the character that is in combat and yet they're not considered active participants. Basically you have to load at your last save (which by the way, is the biggest advice for divinity 2, save often plus more often).  The other frustrating bug is that if you're playing on steam (who isn't?) you will get a launch error 1 out of 3 times. Basically you will get an error code that says the game executable file is corrupted in some way and you can't play. You can try verifying the integrity of the game cache and it works sometimes. Other times you simply have to delete everything and reinstall. Remember to go into your steam library files and set the game to launch in compatibility mode as an admin and this may reduce your errors to 1 in 4 launched. Nothing i have done however seems to get rid of this error.   Basically Larian made a great game but didn't take the time to fix some seriously game breaking errors. The game itself is fantastic but unfortunately it has a few massive gameplay faults in addition to some monstrous stability issues. I would wait another 3 - 6 months before picking this game up. Preferably, wait till it goes on sale because in it's current form it is not worth a purchase at full price."

However, you will almost never be able to play a meaningful MP game with randoms. Can't use global chat at all (UNABLE TO CONNECT TO GLOBAL CHAT) which means you can't ask anyone to join you or see if anyone wants a perma-playbuddy. Because of that, 80% of the people that you connect to will instantly kick you. When you finally get to play with someone, you can't tell who is who because chat doesn't show char names and if someone leaves, you don't get a prompt who did.

But something about it just grates with me. I find it frustrating as much as anything else. Im not saying I dont enjoy it, but the moments of frustration come too frequently to make it likely Ill replay it. The lack of direction is fine, I dont mind random exploring, except  the complete lack of logic to solve some of the puzzles unless you have stumbled on some clues is infuriating.  Like, you get into a tomb but cant open the sarcophagus. Theres a pressure plate and 3 levers on the wall. If you happen to have gone first into the tomb with the clues, youre good. If not, Save Trial and Error Reload - for a very long time, because there is no logic to the solution. And even if you had come across the clues, chances are youd not have taken them in. There are far too many books to read, which makes us skim through some of them, which is a mistake, because 3 hours down the line you may just need the clues in one of a hundred books you didnt carefully read. Some of the battles are unnecessarily long and tedious  a good example is the one in the Blackpits where you have what feels like a thousand bug things to take out. One after a-boring-nother. There are too many skills C it feels padded out C just how many poison skills does one Geomancer need? Maybe Larian should have considered skill upgrades? When you have a character with Geo/Pyro/Summon who has like 60 skills, often you need to get half way through a long battle to know you have the wrong ones equipped for that particular scenario.

I could never get into it, it just never catch me, I've heard a lot of good reviews of this game but still not enough to risk and buy game i never loved genre of. So I pirated it and just fell in love in the first second. I clicked on the skull and hearrd my character  react, almost on everything, almost every single one. It took like few minutes I explored very first room, than I deleted illegal version and bought it. First I want to say that difficulty system is quiet?????? you have the first one, which is for completely noobs like me, but when I learnt some and wanted more competitive gameplay, the next difficulty was too hard, of course for people who had experience in genre. In other ways, the game is amazing, almost all quests you have TONS of possibilities to complete it, or to fail it, or to... avoid it? And when you understand it, in your very first hour, it wakes your curiousity, you start seeking every corner for gameplay pieces, dialogues, you start fast-saving to see all ways of conversations. I am wasting hours in this game, reading all books, my own journal, and still into it. The story is actually very obivious and classic for fantasy. If you read mass fantasy books, movies etc the story will be extremely predictable and boring, but that doesnt make game boring cause of reasons I mentioned above. By playing this game I learnt basics of this genre, and enjoyed already 20 with some hours and ready for much much more. Of course this game has big potention because of simple replayability, and mod support.  Overall I can rate this game on few fields: Story: 5/10 - It is REALLY typical, but still it has good telling Graphics: 7/10 - I know texture quality is not the first criteria rating strategy games, but still it is not very bad, but unlikely most cool texture quality games it looks really beautiful, bright and contrast perfectly balanced. It adds a big load of atmosphere. Gameplay: 10/10 - Basicly not because of this step-by-step, this gameplay actually never different a lot from other games in the genre, because of the variaty and the high quality in every single second in your gameplay, and you will see it, just as you jump in the game.  Buy it, really, you are wasting your time watching reviews or pirating just like i did."

It seems like they put so much effort into screwing you over and pulling back on power to force some kind of balance that nothing really feels very good.

Clicking on literally everything is very annoying, the camera is extremely annoying at times, and as someone who likes to experience the entire game, not just bits and pieces of it, there are too many quests that I can't really do without ditching a party member for another one or getting side tracked by another quest. This also goes along with not being able to do much if you're wanting to play a lone wolf. Some quests force you to travel with a partner. I get that you still get the lone wolf perk with one other companion, but this doesn't change that there are like... 5 different options for companions, all with quests. I simply felt there was too much going on in the first part of the game. I've no doubt this review will get bashed, but that is simply how I felt about it. The environment is ridiculous as well. I was constantly using rain to get rid of oil, fire, poison, etc. It is extremely annoying.

It locks out some key features, including loot storage, the respec mirror, some merchants, and I've ready later on some quest lines.   To my knowledge, Larian has given no indication of when this will be addressed, only suggesting that people reload to a previous act - putting players in the position of losing progress, or playing onward with a gimped game and no ETA for a fix. I understand that this game has not had long since release, but a month for a such a large glitch is unacceptable to me - and the communication for a fix has been lacking.

No. The game begins to feel repetitive and dull after a few hours and begins to make you angry. The game seems like a mix between Diablo 3 and silent storm, mixed with MMO components; However, I enjoy that aspect of it. The story feels so dull that at times I dont give a flying ???? about whats going on I just want to kill something...anything just to give me something to do. I love the aspect of making it rain water or blood and then electrifying that or setting the entire field ablaze with poison or oil from numerous sources. I received this as a gift and I play it with them but theres times they get mad at me cause i'll agro the traders or the guards or a tough enemy before we're done preparing cause I just get bored. The trading mechanic makes me want to have an aneurysm at times, remember to get paid for the product match the price in products or physically count out the money from the merchants inventory. I like the leveling system it's fairly simplistic and straight forward, however, personally me, when I get to the perks screen theres so many different things in it it feels overwhelming and so your just like, ""who cares?"" and pick something you think might help you and your party. The things I really like about the game is the races, classes, and abilities. Those things make he combat really good especially for turn based combat. If you choose undead health potions and poisons are the complete opposite for you, elves are cannibals, and everyone is racist against dwarves....it's a happy little world! There are spells and abilities that seem worthless at first glance but every spell has a purpose, like a spell that makes it rain but does no damage is very important and can give you an advantage.

Also expect ""Git Guds"" and ""Just play on easy"" on the forums if you ever dare to ask for help (not that the game has any tactical difficulty once you memorized the fights).   Biggest disappointment since Dragon Commander. The game feels difficult at first (especially on Tactician) until one learns the tricks of the gimmicky battle system. Foreknowledge(like pre placing barrels and characters) and broken skill combos (lets not even start about the OP brokenness of Thievery in the beginning or the outright game breaking op-ness of telekinesis) in combination with a lack of a real learning phase (other than restarting the game over and over) makes this very frustrating in the beginning (also lets not talk about the save scumming required to not having to spend hours on vendor refreshes or sticking with??????gear).  A couple posts from the forum that i mostly agree with:  https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682611432375/?ctp=4#c1488861734093980210 https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682611432375/?ctp=3#c3223871682612135634 https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682615762993/#c3223871682615798995 https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682615762993/#c3223871682615813182  There is also only the illusion of freedom, while the game is on rails (like the first one). NPC reactions may feel clever and alive but its all show and scripted. Best example of that is an NPC you can have a flirt with who will then fight on your side, unless you trigger the fight the wrong way and i cant even talk to said NPC once hostile, because the scripts dont account for that. I think this is the biggest issue with DoS2, it thinks its so clever, while it really isnt.  P.S.: Also the armor system is the worst i have seen in an RPG so far."

Biggest disappointment since Dragon Commander. The game feels difficult at first (especially on Tactician) until one learns the tricks of the gimmicky battle system. Foreknowledge(like pre placing barrels and characters) and broken skill combos (lets not even start about the OP brokenness of Thievery in the beginning or the outright game breaking op-ness of telekinesis) in combination with a lack of a real learning phase (other than restarting the game over and over) makes this very frustrating in the beginning (also lets not talk about the save scumming required to not having to spend hours on vendor refreshes or sticking with??????gear).  A couple posts from the forum that i mostly agree with:  https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682611432375/?ctp=4#c1488861734093980210 https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682611432375/?ctp=3#c3223871682612135634 https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682615762993/#c3223871682615798995 https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682615762993/#c3223871682615813182  There is also only the illusion of freedom, while the game is on rails (like the first one). NPC reactions may feel clever and alive but its all show and scripted. Best example of that is an NPC you can have a flirt with who will then fight on your side, unless you trigger the fight the wrong way and i cant even talk to said NPC once hostile, because the scripts dont account for that. I think this is the biggest issue with DoS2, it thinks its so clever, while it really isnt.  P.S.: Also the armor system is the worst i have seen in an RPG so far."

If they were only bug-fixes, that would be perfect, but instead, again like its predecessor, I've seen a constant stream of changes addressed at balancing the gameplay and the classes, which is the worst possible thing that can happen to an rpg nowadays. Most, if not all, the best rpgs have at least some rather unbalanced powers and that's good! Most people will actually enjoy and remember the 1 or 2  rather op powers they got at some point in the game and completely forget all the other boring mediocre powers that didn't mean anything for the gameplay! This has always been true, but it began to be forgotten by the developers since when MMORPGs became a thing, because at that point games weren't single player only anymore and players didn't like that some classes could be stronger than others or that some powers were op and could one-shot them. I think we're still suffering from the rot that came from MMORPGs!"

The preset characters are all unique and well developed, each of which come with an extremely intruiging personal questline. The story is easily one of its biggest strengths, as it kept me entralled throughout the entire experience. Another strength of the game is the gameplay itself. The mechanics of the game help build depth both inside and outside of combat. The combat itself is extremely well executed, with battles that can last for over 30 minutes and still be interesting until the very end. This is easily one of the best RPGs to come out in a long time. A must buy for any RPG fan."

Biggest problem is that the game is obviously in an unfinished state. It is riddled with bugs and the programming is very mediocre. Many of the bugs are completely game breaking, some even make you unable to progress through the game further. Combat, while admitedly fun, is based on a ridiculous double armor mechanic that makes the game a walk in the park after a few hours, when you understand how to exploit it. The number bloating is ridiculous, and equipment scales so fast that every time you level up you need to completely re-equip your whole party, redering any equipment you may find with great effort become completely useless after 20 minutes. The scaling system was obviously made by someone with a very deficitary knowledge of even the most basic mathematics. In sum: game had much promise, failed to deliver."

The chances for combat are pretty scattered and tend to be either a mop-job or you get nearly annihilated on turn one.  Combat system looks deep but is really flat.

If you like organizing and cleaning, this is the game for you.    That being said, the RP aspect of the game is very solid.  If you have friends to play this game with and plan on using it as an RPG engine, this game probably rules.  If you are looking for some rough equivalent to an updated FFT, run for the hills."

Regular fire, necro fire, holy fire - they should have called this ""Divinity of Fire: Original Necrofire Sin 2 Wrath of the Fireballs"". Boring and incredibly tedious, especially toward the end.

I played through it on Tactician mode  out of the gate because I beat the first game on Tactician mode and figured I'd master this in no time too.  The difficulty was surprising at times.  But one thing that I really liked about the difficulty was that it didn't rely on RNG for everything.  There are a few RNG elements, but for the most part the fights are designed to be beaten by strategy and predicting what the enemies would do. The over arching story was pretty classic, but what made me really love it was the companion stories.  They were really interesting and I really loved them.  Some people on here have commented that the companions don't interact much, and while I would have loved for them to interact more than they did, I feel like their stories cross over a lot.  For example Sebille and the Red Prince's stories straight up merge near the end if you are playing with them both in the party. I would suggest taking Lohse in your party too, because her personal quest is one of the best. I know there are still some bugs, and those can be frustrating. I know it uses some classic tropes, but classic tropes are classic for a reason.  Sometimes when you try  to reinvent the wheel you end up making a block of rock. The game also does successfully reinvent the wheel at a few points. I played it all through tactician mode and felt it was a good difficulty considering I took the hardest option.  If you are playing a game on the hardest setting you should expect to have to fight some fights multiple times to master them, and it makes me so happy that I never felt like I was just flipping a coin to win a fight.  Every decision in fights matters a lot. It's not a perfect game, but no game has ever been perfect.  This game is pretty damn good though, and if they fixed the broken quests and bugs I would put it in my top 5 RPGs instantly.  My major complaint about this game is that there isn't more of it.

I can say that I really enjoyed the first game and was really looking forward to DOS 2. I'm almost 200 hours into it and I am not even done with the campaign. But being nearly done I think I can give a proper review.  Combat: So most people criticize the game for being turn-based rather than a real-time with pause function. But it feels right in place as the combat still feels so engaging. The combat is tougher since a lot of skills that you have, the enemies have as well. This makes the combat harder but also more rewarding once you get past it. The game is hard yet fair. There are fights that seem impossible but the game provides us with the tools to win or hides the tools within the world. A lot of the skills feel strong and useful. But towards the end game, I find that magic damage started to be more obsolete as it is much faster and easier to physical as that it the most reliable way to damage. Though that might be because my team consisted of 3 physical dealers and one wizard.  Story: This is by far my favorite part of the game. The story is rather simple yet done in a way that makes it compelling. And as someone who played the other Divinity games, there are a lot of surprising plot twists that I was surprised by. But where the game shines the most is the origin stories. You can either create your own character or choose one of 6 pre-made origin characters that have their own backgrounds. And and these stories are very well-written with equally well made characters. It is so interesting to see how much the game changes because of who you are. If you didn't pick an origin character, you can still recruit them but after a certain point, they will become unavaible. It is a rather intersting thing of being a side character to the origin character's stories though. And each origin chracter will have a personal quest which will result in some drastic endings. But some advice, do not play as Lohse. Not because she is bad, she is a great character with a one of my favorite stories. But Lohse is best when played as a companion and her personal ending yields the best reward a video game has ever given.  UI: I will be blunt about it, it's bad. Inventory management is a nightmare. Sadly it is also required in powering up your weapons in the end game. You will spend a long time in your inventory looking through it to find a single item. Crafting can be done through a seperate menu but most of the time you will be combing random stuff together and that is horrible. In the end game, you will have so much clutter mostly involving books and paper with no swift and reliable way to dispose of them.   Other Notes: The game has quite alot of bugs as well. The first area will be rather polished because it was in early access for a long time. But the game is large and some parts are even broken at times. But I would like to say that I have not faced a bug bad enough to take away from my enjoyment. The game is best played (in my opinion) with a roll with it attitude. Just accept mistakes that happen. It is really fun to see all my mistakes bite me in the?????later down the line. And before I forget, the soundtrack. It is a masterpiece. DOS 2 has a different composer from the past Divinity games (RIP Kirill) but the new composer has truly put his heart and soul into it and it is an absolute joy to listen to.   Just buy the game.

You can tell they spent a lot of money and time on the decor.  Here is a review of my meal  Course 1: Perfectly cooked steak.  Tasted sublime and left me wanting more.  Course 2: Mashed potatoes.  Serving size was twice that of the steak, but still quite tasty even if it left me a little bloated.  Course 3: The cook threw a rusty can of green beans at my head from the kitchen.  I kept banging the can against the table until It opened and tried to choke down the food inside multiple times, but couldnt quite keep it down.  Course 4: I could see from my table a dog ???????? on a plate in the kitchen and saw the chef sprinkling powdered sugar on it with a card labeled dessert.  I immediately stood up and left.  Moral of the story:  If you enjoy eating half a perfectly cooked meal and can tolerate swallowing a dog??????dessert, then this game is for you.  If you prefer to enjoy a whole meal, look somewhere else."

The gear is very rewarding, you notice your characters actually develop and become way stronger with each level and each new gear equipment.   The story is rich and the voice acting makes it really helpful if you don't like reading dialogues. You can play the game multiple times and you would have a different experience each time you play it.   Try to get some friends to play with you, they can either help you or turn against you. For example your friend could tell the guards that you stole something and they will put you in jail!. or you can make your friend distract traders and you pickpocket them.   I really recommend this game."

Whatever you do, do not think of this as an rpg, it is not. Its an arena sim. All these different builds you see, all are about doing the same damn thing, but with some diffent skill.   Want to get a heads up on not wasting your time for first few days of playing this crap? Spend hours watching videos to learn the game cause thats only way, else just waste a lot of time in trial and error.   Forget the typical group, mage, tank, healer, rogue. Thats a recipe for death and frustration. It is NOT the base premise for balance in this idiotic game, which is why its so frustrating. People who make games to look like an RPG, then deliver this diablo crap should be called out for it.   And yes I am saying it, Diablo 3 was crap and so is this. So on my 3rd start after wasting alot of time watching build videos I still get wiped easily. Why? Dunno my tanks have some magic armor on their gear but none when fight starts. Why? Who knows and I am not gonna waste more time figuring that out. Most of the fights are big set pieces designed to  wipe your group or drain you of res scrolls etc. Its same thing every fight but the mobs look different.  The people liking this crap must be diablo 3 lovers cause this is not an RPG and not much like DOS 1. It appears, at least the early game, to be balanced around players who know all the skills and spells ahead of time. Who know going in what they are up against. Thats great for the people who played this in early access or some such, but if you are walking into this cold, get ready to a ton of frustration. And most of the guides are dated crap, cause patches have renedered alot of them obsolete.   How long after you buy a game like this can you still get a refund? This was a huge waste of time."

1101,Draba,41,No,0,2017-11-04,Not Recommended,4.1,"Basic combat mechanics are a big letdown for me, the tactician mode in the original kickstarter reward came with a promise that it won't simply be a numbers change. It's exactly that, stats get even more inflated and nothing else that matters is different.  My concrete gripes: Attributes are ARPG level simplistic: pump X for damage, maybe Y if you want more HP for some reason, enough memory to get what you want. Stats get massively inflated between levels, items get obsolete every 30 minutes. Armor system is just dumb, both the split damage resists and the 100%/0% CC prevention. The first game's CC spam was also bad, but there are a lot of better solutions than this thing. Make CC duration get reduced by stats/armor/in general, anything really. Initiative doesn't matter, I go / you go between teams(ok, you could get it on 1 party member). It possible that the game is fun if all you only care about a story and bonking a few baddies on the head. I mostly played the first game for the combat and it was really imbalanced, but fun.  Really don't like this one and I regret my purchase, devs lost my goodwill by entirely ignoring player feedback during the beta.

600,Le Loup-garou,411,3,0,2017-11-05,Recommended,53,"Usually I find that a lot of games that try to fully emulate D&D mechanics suck. There are several exceptions obviously and many fantasy games have some charcteristics taken from D&D even if only minor ones.  This is D&D the video game. You CANNOT get closer without playing D&D or a similar table top with a group of friends. There is even multiplayer, which is amazing. This game is excellent and so story rich it is hard not to get totally absorbed, There is really only one progression path it seems in the main quest set but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.   I suggest playing a charcter with an orgin story as they provide a more immersive experience, and intrestting dialogue options in some situations. I haven't taken the time to use the Dungeon master mode but from what I've seen it makes game play essentially endless if full utilized. I'm not that creative but I'm sure someone is!"

87,bogbrush3,52,55,13,2017-11-05,Not Recommended,117.2,"There are a lot of people that rave about this game, and to be fair there are a lot of positives to it. The combat is very satisfying, the writing is good and the storyline is alright. I like the character creation and customisation through the game, and the ability to customise the Origins characters is a really good addition.   However, none of that is enough to make up for the hours you will spend pixel hunting, reading through online walkthroughs and sifting through inventory screens with no search function and the most awkward 'sort by' system imaginable. There is a skill you learn to be able to see ghosts, but it is hardly ever hinted when you need to use it (even to finish quests), and at one point you even need to use it to see levers which is literally never mentioned and never happens again in the entire game. The questlog is equally illogical, and essentially tells you what you have already done without giving you any idea where to go next, and the waypoints on the map seem like they were put in the game by someone who has not read the plot. Sometimes, you are encouraged to explore with amazing loot as rewards, but other times without any notification at all you can go too far and come back to a town to find half the people dead and quests uncompleteable. In fact, I only found out those people should have been alive because I read it on an internet walkthrough after the fact.  A lot of people praise this game as a throwback to the golden age of RPGs in the 90s and early 2000s, and I get that. But for me, some aspects of gaming have moved on - I dont want to walk around in circles looking for an item that no longer exists because I chose the wrong option in dialogue 3 weeks ago and the quest didnt update. What specifically irks me is that before I bought the game I researched it, and in an interview one of the devs claimed they had made it all but impossible to miss quests by going the wrong way or doing the wrong thing - and in my opinion that is just bull****.  There are people that will mistake this frustration for the game being difficult - it isn't. Once you get a hang of the game mechaincs and level up enough to get decent skills there are very few fights that pose any kind of threat even on the hardest difficulty. What it is is time-consuming, frustrating and illogical unless you want to follow the one-dimensional path the game devs set out for you into a trap that is obvious from the middle of act two, if not earlier.  In my opinion you should just watch a playthrough on Youtube instead of buying it, and if after that you still are interested at least wait until it is on sale - because you are going to need that money to buy a new screen after you smash a hole in your old one."

59,Amitaya,156,100,7,2017-11-06,Not Recommended,121.8,"I'll split this into pro and contra and try to explain my negative aspects. The pro will be shorter because they don't need explanation.  The game is not for everyone. Many however will still like it. So if you are considering a buy, read the below points and ask yourself if they are important for you. I am a completionist. I tend to explore every nook and cranny and I like to manage equipment and skills in RPG's. I'm an old school RPG lover, always comparing classical RPG's to giants like Icewind Dale or Neverwinter Nights 2.  Pro  - Much heart was put into this project. There is love for detail which can be especially well seen in the area design and side quests.  - The music is, like in it's predecessor awesome.  - The diversity of spells and skills is impressive  - there are many secrets, hidden areas and treasure to be found everywhere  - The first act feels like the last game, it has a clear goal, you get a big area with sub areas to explore  - There are difficulty settings to adjust for different playstyles  - Modability is there and it's easy to mod or add already existing ones  - It's relatively bug free  - For an isometric RPG the graphics are really nice    Contra  - The UI: It's ok in the beginning, but later in the game you have to fight a war against cluttering of hundreds of small items with no availability of a search function. Item and craft UI feel half heartedly done and clumsy.  You don't even get nameable bags to put stuff in to sort it manually.  - Romances come late but then way too sudden. There is almost no personal idle banter and when they happen, it's like being forced into a relationship with someone you know nothing about, even while traveling with them the whole time. There is no additional remarks/chats/mentions/opportunities after you take a romance. You feel like being ""together"" with a robot. Also companions don't see/care what you do and with whom. You can romance all options and then, late pick one. Still no idle banter. No personal conversations at all.  - Bugs are few but the ones that are in can break your game or kill all your fun. (possible spoiler example below)  - After the first Act, the pace of the game slows down to a crawl. Instead of being able to chose areas to explore like in the grand RPG's of old: Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights, you get one freakingly huge area and are thrown in without much word of what to do and where to go. This paradigm stays until the end of the game. You don't get much info in your journal of what to do and where to go. You get the huge areas and can go explore all of it. The problem: you are expected to explore the places in the order Larian thought. But get no info on what order that is - apart from too hard (or too easy) enemies.  You can't simply take one single area and explore it as everything is connected and around every corner is another sidequest. Why do you do them you may end up asking yourself. The answer: to get the levels necessary to do your main quest. That's not roleplaying. That's powerleveling.  - Equipping new stuff is a horror: when the old item provided skill points that you used to learn and activate abilities, then on equipping something else you immediately deactivate all abilities your new gear doesn't allow you to wear anymore - without any warning. You then have to look through all the learned skills by yourself and find the ones that were deactivated. Becomes super annoying late game as there are easily a few hundred skills available.  - A few hundred skills is simply too much. It may be a nice idea to have freedom of using what fits the playstyle but with 30ish skills for every school (warfare, scoundrel, hunter and all 8(?) magic schools) and on top of that dozends of secret spell-combinations it's just overwhelmingly too much. - The main quest feels awkward to play. For most of the game I was uncertain if the story aims to force the player into some kind of Battle Royale with their friends. I quit the game at the last dungeon because I lost any interest in finishing it so I don't know if it indeed does. The feeling however, kinda ruined the atmosphere pretty good. And the companions did nothing you would expect in an RPG in such a situation. No long discussions about friendship/love/the right to live. They just say ""yeah, yeah later"". - The world Larian paints in this game is so ugly and imoral, that in the late game I was even considering of ending it for good. Whereever you look, you see discusting atrocities being done upon innocent people and beings. And not just from ""the bad guys"". Beggars torture their dogs, innocent and virtuous seeming (and presented, and behaving) girls who are first saved by you, turn into the next Hitler of their race and want to kill all intelligent life that is not of their race and ready their people for war. People (including your companions and yourself) seem to just shrug off the fact that they talk to mass murderers (your party). It's a cruel, dark, heartless and worthless world. Whatever ending one pursues, it's made clear by Larian that the world may change. But not the nature of it's inhabitants. Surely a completely different from what we saw in the brilliant Original Sin 1. - Riddles are really just time wasting unintuitive walls to make you google the solutions. They are not fun, not interesting and the bigger ones are annoying to handle. I just quit one after trying to solve it for 45 minutes. No hint. No reaction to what you do. No response to if you got something right or not. It just sucks and destroys all fun still left.   All in all I can't recommend this game to anyone who thinks my negative points would be important for them too. Else, enjoy. If all negative points are unimportant to you, this will be a great experience for you.       Example of fun killing bug  (POSSIBLE SPOILER - STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE GAME)               You have to try and get three source points in act 2. If you don't, then a certain NPC will help you out with that by sacrificing a part of their soul for you. In my game I had all three but the NPC did not recognize this. They still answered like I had not and sacrificed part of their soul. This lead much later to their demise. This again lead to them not being available at the end of the biggest and most interesting side quest in the game. That lead to me being forced to cheat to get a good ending for that particular quest which killed all the fun... (SPOILER END)"
440,Capt Stern,85,3,0,2017-11-06,Not Recommended,"1,150.70","A good game in most respects, but I can't recommend it.   It has severe game imbalance issues.  There are spots which are just too difficult to be called fun.  And there is no way to do as in most classic RPGs, where if something is too hard, you go elsewhere and grind up a level or two and give it another shot.  For a game with a limited about of NPCs they are all very cardboard.  Dialog options are limited.  Their ""shouts"" as they sandbox is worse than a half decent modder would accept in Skyrim.  The UI is awkward.  Like a odd mix of very old school RPGs.    Mostly this game feels like a reworked less fun version of Baldurs Gate.  It copies heavily from that game but without getting the mix right."

Without a doubt, its the best modern cRPG game up to date. And as an oldschool gamer, I can understand when someone is saying that nothing can stand in one line with games like Planescape: Torment or Baldurs Gate. Well, it couldnt. Until now. Times changing, and so gaming industry is changing. And we have just received the best, most polished cRPG game ever made. It has to be said, even if we are sentimental.   The world of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is full of content and whats the best, we can interact with almost everything and everyone. There are no boring NPCs with exactly the same dialogue lines. In this game everyone is unique and has something to say. Also, we are talking here about huge cRPG game that is fully voice acted (!) and its not Oblivion-like voice acting with 5 actors. The main narrator, who is with us most of the time, and all the other voice actors, did an outstanding job here. Every character sounds special.  If you have played first Original Sin you know what to expect from fights. They can be approached in many different ways. Even in tough fights, one properly used scroll or skill can change everything. Of course in both ways, because we can easily lose. The fights are hard, made to think in strategic ways and whats the most important, they are very satisfying. Comparing to other cRPG games its one of the best parts of Divinity.  It took me roughly 105 hours to finish the game once, so it can be said that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the biggest cRPG games. Whats more, this game has high replayability value. Every character has its own personality and its own origin story. By playing with different characters we have new quests and we can approach many situations in totally different way C origin characters have their own interactions across whole game. The main story is interesting and I have never lost my interest. I dont want to spoil anything, but its just really good piece of writing. Si""ts are keeping high level as well. Same as in first Original Sin, we also receive minimal amount of help in all the quests. We have to think, "

I would gladly pay for more GM mode content, allowing for further customization and freedom to tell your/my story. I spent at least 120hrs just building my campaign ""Olboria"" and still find room for improvement within the world and story. I plan to continue to revise and balance my campaign through multiple runs. If you're a fan on pen and paper rpgs, but dont have any local friends to play with, this is the game for you!

Perma status have plagued this game to the point where it is happening so frequently it's becoming cumbersome to fix the game saves everytime. I have had trouble with: perma burning from cursed unique/legendary already removed, perma decay, perma wet and having characters be able to keep fighting when their hp is below 0.   It's a simple fix: extracting the save, converting a LSX<->LSF file and editng a rather large XML file to set status to temporarily if you have any programming experience. To the less tech savy I can see this being an issue, as I have had to do it quite a few times now. Would not recommend this game as great as it is till these issues are fixed completely.

The combat mechanics are hamfisted with some abilities being useless <provoke> and other being stupidly OP. The crafting system is a complete joke as most of the things you craft are utterly useless cosumeables and the only weapons / armor you can craft are low level.   The loot system is all RNG based forcing you to save scum if you want good stuff.  I got into act2 before the game just made my wife and I say nope."

It kept me busy for a good couple weeks, and entertained me the whole time. The combat system is entertaining, if a bit challenging, and the world is large and fun to explore, packed with secrets and quests. There are so many choices when picking a character. In general, the game offers lots of choices, but there are so many character combinations it's almost hard to decide what you want to do, so you just make a few characters and play the game twice. It also has great modding community, and all it's other modes are solid as well. It does suffer from some issues though. The UI needs a bit of work, some areas are laggy, some hitboxes are confusing, and the journal sometimes doesn't provide enough information. It's not a perfect game. However, it is relatively new. GIve it time, and I guarantee, all these minor issues will be fixed. The only real issue I have with the game is the ending. You get your final battle and all, but in the end, all that happens is that you hear about what happened to everyone after the events of the game, and some of it sounds like fun, to be honest. All in all, this is a solid gaming experience and a must play for any fan of the RPG genre. It is worth the price."

THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  I haven't completed the game yet, but from what I have seen it is definitely my new favorite game of all time. The amount of fun that I have with this game reminds me of when I first picked up Dragon Age Origins. You can create any type of character you want and even change it later if you aren't happen with your choices. The game doesn't really hold your hand, which is nice, and there are many ways to strategize a battle -- use your imagination! If you have a character that is sneaking around you can initiate combat with your other characters and have that sneaky character get into position before engaging.   The crafty is really tricky in the sense that it doesn't really help you. You can pick up books that give you recipes, but if you don't find any books you wont know how to make certain things. There are guides online to help in this regard, however. The amount of things you can craft is seemingly endless. Dozens of spells are craft only spells!  Try a playthrough by yourself to get your bearings, or jump into a game with a guide and have them show you the ropes. The game is best with friends, but it still enjoyable by yourself.  There are bugs, but it is to be expected. Updates are quick and the developer actually listens to the players.  8.5/10"

The base game has tons of hours of content, and gives you everything you need to make your own stories-- that is, the gamemaster mode is comprehensive and amazing.  If I had to make a comparison... I'd say it's like Coop skyrim but with much more depth and content. In any case, I strongly recommend this game, especially if you have a group of friends you like to play with regularly."

84,Mendhak,487,7,0,2017-11-08,Not Recommended,146.8,"Backed as part of the Kickstarter campaign, had been hoping for more of what made the first D:OS memorable.  Unfortunately for me this isn't what D:OS2 was like, it was more serious and the joviality of the first was gone, giving it a somewhat generic feel.  I also wasn't a fan of the 'refined' surface mechanic - I realized this when I found myself standing in a 'cursed electrified blood cloud', it was now dancing into the realm of ridiculous.  It was similar for the additional source mechanic, it just didn't click with me - towards the middle of the game, the combat began to feel like a chore.    The serious tone of the game made the towns and cities completely dull.  And while a great amount of detail had been paid to the beginning of the game, the middle and ending of the game as well as the story felt a bit rushed and loose in terms of focus; as did certain quests, which seemed to be completely missing any context or information.    Some parts are pretty good though - the soundtrack is memorable, a bit broodier and darker than the first, though I am listening to it on repeat now and hoping to buy it soon.  There are plenty of spells to pick and choose from, though it is hampered by the enforced AP limit.  The story was... just-ok, if a bit tedious.  Performance wise, I was getting a steady 120+ fps at most places.  The artwork and level design are just great - there's a lot of detail in every place you visit.  So there was enough to somewhat keep the interest going for the sake of finishing.    Overall - decent but not seeing the accolades, good art and music carrying a dull story.  It didn't bring back the charm of D:OS, so if I were speaking to my past self, would not have recommended."
1371,Andy Dwyer,656,2,0,2017-11-09,Recommended,74.5,"Probably the longest review I have ever written or will ever write, unless Original Sin 3 comes soon, SO, TL:DR; This has become my favorite game of all time. It's the best CRPG I've played since the old school ones, and then adds more mechanics and better story telling.   Pros: -Elemental Interactions -Companions so good I had a hard time picking who to bring in my party -Fun combat and mechanics -Excellent puzzle design for Acts I and II, and just really really good puzzle design in Act III.  -Compelling storyline, that ties in neatly with the other Divinity games, without requiring you to play them (though you should) -No microtransactions, season pass, loot boxes, etc.  -Able to respec your character as much as you want -Excellent skill management system -Excellent crafting systems -Excellent visuals in regard to spell effects and great art design -Excellent RPG elements, relative to character creation, talents, skills and tags -The music is off the charts for the most part -Great voice acting and sound design -Choices that actually matter during the story and change the story -Oddly descriptive ""intamacy"" scenes if you romance a character (is that a pro, maybe, it was well written) -Difficult enought that I was challenged and died plenty on the second highest difficulty, but never felt frustrated enough to quit or scum the game -Excellent game, because there's no other word I can use to describe it.   Cons: -Had a crashing issue during a few of the cut scenes between Acts -Music repeats a lot if you're repeatedly getting in and out of combat -Items like arrows and grenades get auto added to your hot bar, and I constantly had to clean it out for skills to be in the order I want, playing as a polymorph character I had a lot of skills appearing and disappearing between combat  Overall, you should play this game if you like turn based CRPGs, RPGs in general, turn based games, good games or even if you just want to support a great indie game dev. It reminded me of Dark Souls 1, where when I finished my first playthrough, I instantly made a new character, and started to play again with a completely different play style.  Update: you should also nominate and vote for this game whenever possible, so it can get some well deserved praise."

I have never been interested in them, but with all the praise this game has been receiving, I figured I would buy it to try it out. I have been thoroughly impressed with the quality and quantity of the game thus far, especially for the cheaper price tag. The level of complexity with the combat system and crafting is unmatched, I feel like I discover new ways to play the game every few minutes. It can be a difficult game, though that makes it so satisfying when you win a battle. The game doesn't hold your hand, and my friend started out feeling overwhelmed by what we could or couldn't do. The tactical decision making sort of reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins, though more in-depth by far.   Performance is pretty good, there isn't SLI support, though you probably won't need it. The game dropped frames significantly once when surrounded by fire, smoke, gas, and electricity in a high foliage area.   I fully recommend this game if you're even remotely on the fence about it, and I look forward to spending hundreds of hours mastering different classes. The savior of the RPG genre!"

Most modern games don't grab my attention that long anymore, but this is one of the few that really keeps on being interesting and enjoyable.   Divinity OS 2 is a cartoonylooking RPG with turnbased elements. You have a big world to explore with your main character and 3 companions. You can build your characters in any way you want, with different talents, skills and stats. And it is fun to try out different party compositions. I ended up with having one ranger, one necromancer/scoundrel, one mage and one polymorph fighter. And there are many other ways to build your party, fitting to your playstyle.  The combat is the thing the game is most appraised about. It is turn based, and you can manipulate the battleground with surfaces from skills or items. And combining them in more powerful effects. For example you can throw oil on the floor to set it on fire. Or you can let it rain, and freeze enemies to death! It has many options and the combat has because of this many different outcomes, multiple techniques are possible. If you find the combat too easy or too hard, you can change the difficulty as well. I played most time on Classic mode, I found that the best balance for me to enjoy the game.  Another good thing about the game is the story, and the quests. You can get quests by talking to NPCs or exploring, and those are stored in your journal. You won't get exact questpointers, but with a little story that enfolds when you do more talking, exploring or fighting. For some people that would be a downside, but I really miss that in games, that you have to play the game more to find it out instead of running to a pointer and doing what is needed. The story is filled with intriguing characters, a nice pace and many plottwists to keep you awake. The NPCs make the gameworld interesting and feel alive. You can in some situations persuade them with skillchecks, and what you say to them may have an influence on how much they will help you or perhaps make your day bad if you fail. I feel like the humor in this game is a lot more subtle and less forced than in the first Original Sin game. It makes me feel to explore the world more and talk to NPCs. And the best thing: EVERYTHING IS FULLY VOICED! Which makes the game feel so finished.  Even that the artstyle is more cartoony, it is still beautiful in it's way. It doesn't look cheap or outdated, and there are many beautiful environments to adventure in. The music is good as well, I didn't feel bored by it. And you can change the main instrument of the battle songs of the characters you are playing, which is a nice detail. Other positive points on the game are: The Multiplayer mode, you can play an own campaign with your friends, or you can enjoy the main storyline too. This is a fun addition, and you can make it even more interesting with mods from the Workshop. The crafting system is unmissable from RPGs as well, and it is in this game as well. You can use almost everything you find to make armour, potions, arrows, grenades, whatsoever by combining them. This is fun to do, but I do recommend to find and use recipes since there are so many options.   So there is a lot of praise from me as well. But are there any downsides? Well, one thing that bothered me quite a bit was that there were plenty of bugs (some even gamebreaking) in the game. They have fixed many at the start of the release, but the further you get in the game, the more bugs and glitches you will find. That is a shame because this game is so wonderful, and has so much potential.  Do I recommend this game? Yes I definitely do!

664,Yoshiris,42,3,1,2017-11-11,Not Recommended,85,"Pros: The story line is good.  The battle is good.  Cons: The camera is aweful. Navigating the map is a stressful mess. When your party member finds a hidden treasure, he says he spotted something, but the map is so hard see that you can't tell where that shining mound is. The NPC will tell you of a location of a cave, but even if you are standing right in front of it you can't see the entrance. Exploring the world is supposed to be full of surprises and a sense of adventure. Instead it just feels like a series of rotating the camera in order to understand your surroundings.  The UI is aweful too. You can learn a few dozen skills in the game, but you can only see one bar of skills and need to toggle the bars all the time to use the skills. The only way to manage skill bars is by adding one skill or deleting one skill.  There is no sorting for skills so you have to manually sort the skill bars. And when you have your skills sorted and you want to insert a fire skill that you just learnt, you have to delete a skill in that slot, meaning you have to reorganize every skill after the skil bar. Maybe sorting is too hard to implement, but why can't we just insert a skill?  Inventory management sucks too.  There are mildly valuable things on the streets, but as you keep picking them up your inventory becomes a mess that you don't want to look at.  The content of the game, the story and the battle system are good. But the interface is so horrible that it is impossible to enjoy them. I would love to play the game if the camera is a normal third person view, and the UI gets polished enough or the game rule changes such that you don't need a polished UI (limit the number of skills you can memorize to 8, don't litter the world with trashes so your inventory doesn't clog up.  At this moment it feels like they made a world that they wanted to make without caring about how the player experiences it. They might think the game is strategic and fun when you have 4 members full of 50 skills and items, but in reality having to manage all these things is too much hustle."

790,Roger Feederer,204,3,0,2017-11-12,Recommended,42.8,"The true game of the year in 2017.  Hopefully the steam review system/tagging system gets this game to pop up on your store, because you probably won't hear about it from major outlets or podcasts.  I honestly thought turn based strategy had gone the way of XCOM.  Divinity, however, can be more readily compared to Dragon Age: Origins...only with more story, more character customization, interesting party members and fun yet challenging combat.  There's no need to experience any of the previous games (I didn't).  If you have ever enjoyed RPGs then play this game."
1718,Kipacus,31,2,0,2017-11-12,Recommended,98.2,This game gave me and my friends that old school Dungeon and Dragons Feel.  It gave me about 55 hours of gameplay if you take your time and enjoy the side quests and all of the content the creators added for you.  Clearly they listened to what the people wanted and gave it to us.  You have the freedom to build the charactor how ever you want.  I can not reccomend this game enough.  The game had a major bug when I first bought it thats now resolved (If you were player 2 and a summoner your spells would vanish and your summon wouldnt have their abilities only auto attack).  But like I said that was already resolved.  The game in its current state I give a 9/10.
187,Wolf Barrick,241,2,0,2017-11-12,Not Recommended,149.8,"Before I start, I want to say that I LIKE this game for the most part. This could have been much more great that it ended up to be, in my opinion of course. Just a side note: It's waaaay better to play this in single player even if Coop is available. Why? Well, I played with two other friends and we encountered many problems on the way, because the game seems to treat every character as a single player instance, so dialogs repeat for every single one of us and even Persuasion Checks has to be redone and since only one of us takes the Persuasion skill, everything goes to hell half of the time. That is really BAD! The game offers the choice of installing mods to ease up some of the, not so great, game mechanics. Too bad that those can corrupt your save file in a way that the game takes forever to load and your friends when joining (with the same mod installed) will have a huge desync problem. No hair, Nullify Resistances instead of Leadership, broken skills, an axe that for reason turned into a crossbow, a wooden figurine that is a spear that deals 2-3 damage... yeah, we've seen some weird stuff. We abbandoned the idea of playing coop again after this. Back to single player though, they made some changes from Dos1. Crafting does not require a skill, but it's still really poor in what you can do. You can craft yourself a new armor that has your level, but it would have been nice if you could create magic or even epic equipment to have some nice bonuses added to the, otherwise, fairly useless piece of junk you crafted. It would have been nice if I could improve my equipment through crafting too, outside of adding nails to boots, that was not bound to runes. Runes are nice, but I would have liked the chance to slot my equipment in order to fit them. They removed the Bodybuilding and Willpower skills and added the Physical and Magical Armor to protect you from ailments. Before we had a chance to being afflicted by CC statuses, now until your Armor is up you are completely immune to them. I seriously dislike this mechanism, the only thing that does is making enemies tankier and CC skills useless until you manage to break through their armor. No thanks, I know that having a chance calculated on a skill you have wasn't really great either, but I highly preferred that at that point. At least I could use CCs regularly to help me out. ""AI is smarter!"" Wrong, AI is either doing weird stuff or, especially during boss fights, shamelessly Cheating the system just to F*** you up. You have a maximum of 6 AP for turn, usually a normal character gets 4 AP a turn unless he has the Glass Cannon or Lone Wolf talent. You get a free point of movement if you have The Pawn talent. Well, you will see enemies move for kilometers and being able to use two spells (that usually costs 2 or 3 AP), move again and maybe even drink some tea out of spite of you. Everytime that happend I examined them with Loremaster 5 and found out that they had no Talents and their maximum AP was 6. Plus, some enemy doesn't seem to have any cooldown to his skills. That is just wrong... I get the idea of ""Battles are stacked against you"", but making the AI cheat to do that? That is just cheap, couldn't you do better than this? Let's not forget the times where a Melee opponent is able to strike you from way below you for reasons. I.E. ""Let's climb this ladder so he won't be able to strike my mage down since there won't be any line of sight!"", he attacked him anyway. Plus, if you play an undead character, nobody will know that you are one while in town an fully covered in armor. That is good, but if you enter combat, magically even the poorest sod in town will know that you are an undead and will cast upon you all sort of healing spells to wipe you out. That is cheap and dumb. Was the Loremaster skill on sale that everyone has it over the roof? I seriously disliked this. They added Character Tags in the game that adds unique dialog lines for your character and might help you doing some quests! Are they good? No. They're mostly useless and you won't need any of them except from Scholar and maybe Mystic. Scholar is direly needed if you want to complete all of the side quests you can find, Mystic is needed for one quest if I recall correctly and that's it. All the other Tags won't add anything to your game, the lines you say are quickly dismissed by the Npcs and won't open for you any Quest or available outcome of one. What was the point of them? Roleplaying the character. Sure, but it's pointless if most of the times your Tag choices doesn't create any consequence in the quest! Why should I bother? Combat mechanics are solid for the most part. Sometimes large enemies are an issue because of hitboxes, it happened to me that when I tried to hit an enemy, he would move for his animation and my character instead of attacking, moved to his side wasting an AP. Really want an Undo button for movement. I disliked the Source system a lot. Basically some skills, the higher tier ones, requires you to have and consume Source. You have a maximum of 3 points of Source that you can only acquire by stepping into Source puddles, using a Source fountain (there's only one for act, but it has infinite source in it) or using Source Vampirism on spirits, dead bodies or enemies if they are sourcerers. The skills you can use with source are good, but I felt way too limited since at some point every enemy mage will use Source Vampirism or Purge to drain you of all your source. Not a fan of Source, sorry. Quest wise the game offer you a lot of quests that you can complete. Too bad that there are a lot of quests, especially during Act 2 that are left unfinished and offers no satisfaction whatsoever and a feeling of ""That's it?"". There's a lot of breakable quests too. I lost count of the quests that didn't close in my journal because of reasons or quests that resulted in a dead end. It's nice that they added a lot of side quests, but it matters not to me if half of them are dead ends. Won't say anything on the story, since spoilers. I can say it's ok. The soundtrack is awesome, loved especially Lohse's song.  In conclusion, what I can say about this game is: Wait for an Enhanced Edition (if there's gonna be one) where MAYBE  they will polish this game and hopefully remove the problems I personally encountered. Otherwise wait for a sale, don't buy it at full price unless you really want to."

I would not recommend anyone play this alone. Nothing you do matters as everything boils down to a choice at the end.  A real shame since I really liked the first divinity game. This game feels unfinished and unpolished; especially with some save/load buggs kicking your coop partner(s)."

Just not a fun experience.   Update: This game certainly is better with a full group of players, however, I'm changing my rating from a thumbs down to 10 thumbs down. You'll enjoy it at the start and hate it by the end.   Do you enjoy spells that don't do what they say they do, like last 1 turn when they're supposed to last 2? How about enemies that have more AP than you'll ever have and can attack you 3 times before it's even your turn, so that you start the battle nearly dead? How about having to game the game in order to win a fight since you're nearly always outnumbered by more powerful enemies?   This game also has spells that will be blocked by your enemie's armor but bypass yours like it's not there, enemy attacks that will go through solid object like walls and floors, enemy attacks that will wipe the group in 1 hit, chat options that completely ignore actions you took previously like they never happened, and a final boss fight that is so ridiculous and rage inducing that 9 out of 10 cardiologists recommend avoiding this game.  Yeah you get a lot of playtime for the money, but you won't get the fun or enjoyment that should come with it. If you're a masochist and play this trash anyway, I recommend using an undead elf that can talk with animals and focus on a strength build. You'll be OP and may stand a chance.  Terrible, terrible game. Rather go to the dentist."

However, the game does nothing to help you and expect to die all the time.  I'm pretty much done playing at this point because I've had to walk through the same starting area multiple times because everything is better than you are.  If you play the standard difficulty, most foes 1-2 shot you.  There doesn't seem to be a way to level up without trying to get through one of these overpowered encounters.  Now, it's possible that I'm not seeing some strategy, but this is the starting area, and there's been nothing to help you with how you might overcome things above your level.  So basically, it's been multiple hours of frustration and any of the positives the game presents are quickly overcome by the stupid difficulty level and lack of in game information."

1933,Krysle Quinsen,593,2,0,2017-11-13,Recommended,110.4,"This game can be co-op up to four players and there is PVP arena mode as well as GM mode. But I never tried it. So it will be an overall review in single player perspective.  The Story is awesome, it's about god and stuff, the writing is exceptional as well as voiceover, which is mostly a narrator style (think Bastion). Dialog choice is a 3rd person rather than a sentence. The plot twist is good, the lore is great and not out of places (most fantasy game that contains gods and magic mostly not explained well.) and are all connected with every character in the game. There's some noticeable rush in writing in the last act, though.  The puzzle is OK, not much pixel-hunting but last act is not that great and might confusing.  The Quest system is well-designed, there's not much hand-holding and marker much and you can literally kill everyone and not break the game. However, quest item can be sold or dropped, be careful about it.  There are 4 playable races in this game, Human, Lizard, Elf, Dwarf, all with their Skeleton version (8 in total) and can be customized, their lore is interested and not that cliche, the design is very exotic for Lizard. However, Elves do have some weird armor and facial but have interesting lore.  The Combat is just good in tactical stuff, this game used the Round-Robin style where you move one character for each turn, who have the highest initiative(speed). Because of this, a lot of thinking will be required whenever you want to burst someone down or set up some potential combo with environment effects using magic. (Oil/Poison + Fire = Burning Ground, Water + Electricity = Electrical Water or perhaps turning Burning into Steam then electrified it? or blessed fire for healing instead?) There's friendly-fire on magic, so be careful not to kill your melee characters. This game used Armor system (think Barrier from shooting game like Mass Effect) where most negative effect only worked when particular armor is depleted. Which IMHO, work better than RNG system in the first game. AI is also meanie, so don't go in blindly or grouped up too much. They're quite smart. There's quite balance issue in the late game, though, where you literally OP, especially with the usage of Source Abilities.  Although The Music isn't composed by Kirill Pokrovsky (RIP) but Borislav Slavov (Crysis Series) is doing a great job also! the theme is very memorizable, The Rivellon Theme is just too good, the combat music is nice (which also based on instrumental selected on character creation), The Battle for Divinity is story climax combat. There's one vocal song too.  Crafting, however, not that useful and a couple of recipes are useful. You might pick up a lot of junk thinking it as crafting mats, only to be used with one common scroll recipe.  This game support Modding, means there will be QoL mod, overhaul or a campaign for you to play. This disables achievement but there's a mod for it.  TL/DR: Looking for a good single/co-op cRPG with exceptional story and lore that is well-connected with awesome races (Lizard <3), a tactical turn-based combat that required a lot of strategies, perhaps just a game OST for your collection, or doing some RP with Game Master mode? then go ahead, full price!  Now, that's the potential GOTY award for 2017. My The Suspension of Disbelief Award.  PS: I don't write a review much, so it might be messy, I'll try to improve or perhaps changes the style."

It's as close to a pen-and-paper RPG as you are going to find in video game form, and it's awesome.  Significantly improved writing, combat, and general approachability from the first game.  Huge amount of customization and deep combat system.  Keep in mind this game is 1) quite long 2) requires you to read, think, and sometimes retry things a different way, 3) takes a bit to warm up.

111,Gravy,64,10,1,2017-11-15,Not Recommended,146.2,"As someone else said - this is the best game I have ever given a negative review to. 146 hours on record as of this writing.  1. Some of the fights are virtually impossible on any difficulty except the easiest. The scarecrow fight is a great example of a fight I lost dozens of times on anything but the easiest difficulty.. I respecc'd every character several times and spent 20,000 gold on spellbooks and gear and still could not win this fight on any difficulty but the easiest (explorer). Some of the voidwoken fights you end up with two dead in your party by the end of the first round (usually the casters and bow users) because they get two-shotted. The enemy cooldown on spells is short - some can fear/curse/blind/terrify every other round....far more often than you can cure using peace of mind or other spells.  2. Crafting is nearly useless. 90% of what you craft is crap. the food benefit is minimal. The crafted weapons and armor are only good for the first hour of the game and then you will never need again. Potions are ok, but the action point cost to use them means you miss out on a round of damage for the small gain they bring. (breakeven at best).   3. No resurrection spell. <edit> I was informed this spell is available late in the game. Not helpful and this means I have to pickpocket every vendor with a ressurect scroll in their inventory to have neough to get through the fights.  4. Pickpocket is badly overpowered. Simply engage the target in conversation with one character and then switch to another character to do the pickpocketing. Once you have everything, move the person with the goods a screen away. Then change back and get out of the conversation and run away. By the time the npc goes their their ""I've been robbed"" drama all your characters are too far away for them to be searched.  5. Most non-human enemies can teleport/fly. This means they are all over the place and nearly impossible to kill using melee. Best party is 3 mages who all can summon multiple minions/totems and a ranger. (all must have restoration and teleport spells). The concept of a ""tank"" does not apply very much to this game since the enemies are all over the place and move around every round.  6. Wands and staffs are useless. They dont do enough damage to warrent using them when you can use another spell for those same two action points. Give your casters any two items that increase their spell damage (sheild, wand, sword, dagger, etc).  7. Highlighting - Why some things are highlighted and not others makes no sense. a flower across the map shows up but not the barrel/box/bones right next to you. The valuable painting on the wall does not highlight but the useless cooking pot does?   8. Stacking - I have 8 items in my inventory all called ""garlic"" and sometimes they stack and sometimes they dont. Same with pumpkins and other things.   In general, I find the game frustrating with moments of enjoyment."

734,Aphex,120,2,0,2017-11-15,Not Recommended,98.8,I prefer the first game. Magic/Armor-System ruined the game for me and was propably implemented to balance multiplayer/pvp.  Using skills is pointless because by the time they would do anything other than damage you might as well finish off the enemy. This makes combat super boring due to lack of tactics and forgett about using the environmental effects like in OS:1....enemies will just walk through them. The exessive use of verticality and the spread of enemies only add to that issue and make aoe spells useless. Mages simply suck. Magic armor makes enemies immune to all spell-cc and phys.-armor makes them immune to phys.-cc. Going either full phys or magic team is the way to go.  Oh did i mention that you are limited to 6ap total now? Stupid descision and clearly another attempt to balance pvp.  Itemisation is ????ed. Scaling is ridiculous. People ended up defeating the end boss in one turn due to terrible balancing. Using warfare is mandatory for ALL physical charakters including archers due to damage multiplication. Cross character combos are non existant. Game is a dumbed down mess.  In conclusion: Poorly implemented new systems that are outright unnesscesary. Why fix what isn't broken?  The camera/environment doesn't help either because something is constantly blocking your view.  Overall rating: Monumental dissapointment. Buy the first game instead and then forget about the series.

301,Dogg,196,6,0,2017-11-18,Recommended,110.3,"**spoiler free**  What a fantastic journey. Every once in a while, you get incredibly hyped for that next game that's about to come out... and every so often, that very game delivers on the hype. This game ultimately did that for me, and I'm almost sad that the journey is now over (unless I start another new game). Starting each category at 10 points.   Visuals: starting at +10 ================ The game's graphics look fantastic. There is a vast amount of polished detail in each and every environment. The developers didn't leave anything out. Even areas you may only explore once, if only for a couple of minutes, got all the same polished details as areas that you'll be spending hours upon hours inside of. Brilliant, long, hard work went into sewing the fields of this game's visuals, and the developers are reaping the fantastic benefits of that hard work. Well done.  + No real cons here. I never had any screen tearing and rarely saw any seams throughout the world.  Final score: 10/10    Sound/Music: +10 ============= For anyone who has read my past reviews, you'll know I use the word ""weight"" a lot when it comes to sound effects. This ""weight"" means that for each and every major sound effect in the game, there should typically be some kind of ""impact"" behind them. It doesn't have to be a big ""boom"" for that to work. It can be the sounds of butterfly wings flapping in the wind (which would be incredibly hard to hear), or it can be a loud thunderbolt. Either way, whichever object or environment a sound effect has been stuck in/onto, it has to have a strong feeling behind it. This is not easy to explain, but let's just say that Divinity Original Sin 2 pulls it off extremely well.  + All abilities sound effects, even ones that are as simple as throwing a dagger, feel heavy. There is strength behind them. No ability is left out, nothing is in the ""filler"" category. Excellent.  + Music appears to be orchestra, and it's great. Battle music pumps you up. ""Majestic"" music calms you down, and provides a sense of relief behind it. It all sounds fantastic.  + Pre-final battle music setup is excellent (only those who've played the game will understand).  + Great voice work across all characters, both major and minor.  Final score: 10/10    Performance: +10 ============= Overall, the game runs well.   + When everything is working, it performs at 60 FPS, constantly.  +/- Long long load times between regions. I mark this as neither a plus or a minus due to the fact that once you're loaded in, there are no load times whatsoever. The game loads everything upon entry (this is why is takes so long).  - Bugs bugs and more bugs. Nothing game breaking fortunately. A common theme when it comes to Larian Studios games. The good news is, most bugs are extremely minor. Quest bugs WILL be contracted, inhibiting you from actually completing a quest. Other quest related bugs include 1) actually completing a quest, but it never leaving your quest log. 2) you have option A and option B to choose from. You chose option A, but the game will say you chose option B. -1  - Certain battles have frustrating situations where a turn will not end immediately, forcing you to wait for up to 5-10 minutes at a time for each turn to finally end (even though nothing is happening). This will hopefully be patched in the near future. It was not patched in this playthrough. -1  - Game will crash every now and then. -1  - Strange lag issues in regards to certain spells (such as blood storm). These lag issues will persist until the specific spell (or spells) animations have completely ended, sometimes several turns after being cast. -1  Final score: 6/10   Story: +10 ======== You are a source wielder. You've been captured and you're about to sent to what would closely resemble a ""prison island"" to serve out your remaining days. It's time to escape! This is where the adventure begins.  + Premade characters all have an actual personality that you will love or hate. It will slowly be fleshed out as the story progresses, whether for better or for worse. Whichever character you pick (or don't pick, you can make your own too) will still have their main story attached, but you get to make a plethora of extra decisions behind them that will ultimately influence their endgame personality. So don't be afraid to pick the premades (you can also edit their classes and appearances).  + Relevant in-game choices that will affect the endings.  + Special endings for certain characters are available.  - Some scenes would have a far greater impact if it wasn't simply reading text. A few animations here and there wouldn't hurt, especially behind big scenes (that would normally be a cutscene vs an interactable scene). -1  Final score: 9/10    Gameplay: +10 =========== Gameplay hinges upon building your starting character with either physical, magical, or ranged damage types (ranged being both physical and magical, depending on if you're an archer or a mage). You'll run around and collect lots of loot, sell the loot, buy better loot; craft items, scrolls, and potions; learn a vast amount of abilities and even craft secret ""hidden"" abilities; there is plenty to do here, and you will be busy, all while having fun (hopefully).  + Respec any time once you hit Act 2, for free. This will actually probably enrage some players, because they want to feel the weight of locking in their choice of permenant abilities (i.e. Diablo 2). Respecing for me on the other hand was the greatest thing to ever happen in this game. I started as a Battlemage, switched to a full time mage, and then later switched to a mostly full-timer tank/DPS with certain mage support abilities attached. I had another character start as a full healer and supporter, who later stayed as a full healer supporter, but also had fire and ice abilities to help in combat, if they couldn't do anything else. You can experiment to your heart's delight. So get past Act 1, then indulge in the world of change!  + You can play as a skeleton, with facial hair.  + Various unique abilities for each race are well implemented and can provide extra benefits to playing a certain class with a certain race (such as a thief/assassin with an undead, due to getting a free skeleton key to unlock any chest provided you have high enough Thievery skill. No need to buy lockpicks!)  + Crowd control in this game is just as fantastic as it was in the first game, with a vast amount of new CC abilities (like sleeping).  + The addition of Armor and Magic Armor is also fantastic, providing you with protection against CC abilities of both the physical and magical aspects until that chosen armor is depleted (unless you have Glass Cannon).  + Playing with friends is a lot of fun.  +/- Some talents in the game feel wholly useless (Demon and Ice King), while others feel overpowered. I mark this as plus or minus simply because you can respec at any given time. It would only benefit to take certain ""less useful"" talents to quick specific areas of the game, then respec again back to whatever you were originally with. That being said...  - I played the game on Tactician mode (which is basically hard mode) and having a slightly higher fire resistance or slightly lower ice resistance never really made that big of a difference. The enemies in this mode having such incredibly strong physical or magical abilities would typically negate your armor too too quickly, and 15% out of 100% is just not very helpful. Leadership was a much better option, and also freed up the ""wasted"" talent points. These less useful abilites are what you would call ""filler"". -1  Final score: 9/10    Overall: 8.8/10 (44/50 = 0.88) ===================== A well delivered fine wine that will age almost indefinitely for days to come. Will sip on again. Great job to the developers."

11,Grumpy Old Dwarf,547,22,1,2017-11-18,Not Recommended,186.1,"Loved the first one to bits, was so hyped for the sequel, didn't get into the early access as I didn't want to spoil the pleasure but bought the game soon after the official release. Played it with my gf via split-screen coop. The experience can be summed up with one word - a chore.   Pros: - The narrator is awesome. - The voice acting is decent, some characters are excellent.  - Some dialogues are smart and funny, mostly pet-pal related stuff.  - It's got dwarves in it. - The co-op component is implemented in a very intuitive, user friendly way.  - The music is better than in the first game. - IT'S GOT DWARVES IN IT! Other games take example.  - Character progression and itemization are OK. - The game comes packed with various roleplaying options and features. - The storyline is quite open, there is no good guys vs bad guys, it's not clear whether we (as a party) should be doing the things that we're doing. It's all grey area, sacrifice for the greater good sort of story but it's always up to the player to draw the line.  - The journal is a nice touch, way better than your usual quest tracker, unfortunately navigating it with a controller is a chore. - The Game Master mode is pure gold.   Cons: - The main story is terrible. Seriously, the first one wasn't that strong either, but at least it didn't treat itself overly seriously. The sequel is cheesy and plain stupid, but it's oh so serious about the plot. It feels like a third-grade fan fiction, or a tabletop RP game run by a weak but overly ambitious 14yo GM. - The origin stories are weak, the characters in general are weak and not interesting. Couldn't care less. - The pace of the game is uneven, often times you will find yourself wondering what's next, where should I go or why am I here in the first place? Unfortunately the game is designed in such a way, that even 1 level makes all the difference in the world. So if you wonder off the road or arrive in a certain place too early you will run into some tough, unfair fights. This was similar in the first game, but in the first game you could handle some tougher enemies by being creative and careful. Here's not the case due to terrible encounter design, shallow tactics and linear flow of combat. More below. - The combat, the highlight of the title, the thing that kept me playing through the first game, is utterly boring. The encounter design is terrible. I loved the fights in the first one, the planning, the strategies, the enemies. Here 99% encounters feel like trash fights - all are virtually the same. Every enemy can fly, cast spells, teleport, shoot, heal etc. Usually your party gets ambushed with enemies popping out of the thin air. There's no preparation, no scouting, no positioning. CC, spell combos, buffs, debuffs, positioning etc all are next to useless - raw physical damage is the way to go most of the time. Boring.  - Some encounters are just plain stupid. Do not confuse stupid with difficult. The first game had some very difficult yet enjoyable and rewarding fights. Here it's just not fun, the enemies cheat all the time, the game can instakill you on random, the fights are long and tedious, sometimes there's a key component to a fight and if you don't know it you are bound to lose.  - You either fight a long, unfair, mostly boring battle you are very likely to lose, or... you can easily cheese the crap out of most encounters. Lame design.  - The bloody necrofire, seriously, it's ugly, it's overused, it's annoying, it's hard to see or select anything, yet it's up 80% fights. - The game is riddled with bugs, nothing major so far (mainly UI and controller related stuff), but the little buggers take out another chip of enjoyment from this game. It's been in development for so long it's unacceptable.  - The UI for the gamepad is cumbersome, way too big. Cannot be scaled down.  - Loading screens are waaaaaay to long.   The first game was lighthearted and fun, the combat system was excellent, the encounters were very well designed and interesting. The sequel is a bloated mess, the story is overly serious yet very silly and childish, the combat system offers less variety, feels slower and unbalanced, the combat encounters feel uninspired, repetitive and boring. Beware of bugs. Been waiting for this game a long time but I sincerely regret spending money on it. It's big, it looks good, all the components look good on paper but it's just not fun to play. Going through the main story is a chore. Reading the dialogue is a chore. Fighting your way through boring fights is a chore. Exploring the world is a chore. There is a good game somewhere underneath, I guess some people will like it as it is. I didn't.  Verdict: A chore.  4/10  The only good additions are the narrator, the dwarves and the GM mode."

I also played Divinity Original Sin 1 and als ready had a lot of fun there. Unfortunatly i never completed it, because i was missing a stone shard, that ive never found.  But i have to say THIS is way more casual than the first part. It is easier to get into, but still the quest are missing categorization to side or main quest and we got stuck some times (but way less than in Divinity 1).  Pros: + Splitscreen for 2 Players + can be fully played with only 2 characters using ""lonewolf"" ability. (2 Player 2 charaters is a good setup and the lonewolf makes it pretty easy in some parts of the game) + large worlds giving a lot of playtime and discovery. + all RPG elements are very well implemented (Looting and Leveling is as it shoudl be, most important and fun) + a lot of side storys and word telling, giving you a great feeling for the world youre playing in  Cons: - Some minor bugs. I got totally stuck one time! Make sure to save as often as you can - really annoying popup window, everytime i start. TO ALL WHO SAY THEIR GAME DOESNT WORK: it is probably this. The game tries to connect to some sort of service, which fails. Make sure to have .NET framework installed. Start the game, wait 2mins, try to start it again. then the popup should show. Click ""OK"" and the game shoudl start. - The quests are not obvious. It is always a problem to know what to do, in order to solve them, also a lot of quests interfer with each other, which leads to quests cannot be closed and so on. If you are stuck lookup the internet. I dont think its possible to completely fail the main quest though.   Conclusion: This is a great game and if you got a real life friend who also loves RPGs, grab 2 controllers and play, you will not regret it. I have not tried playing it Single Player."

I am so tired of game developers creating games and allowing there in game npc's to completly transend the rules of nature in the game. I have found in many situations enemy's will just outrite resist my ability's despite not having an immunity to it. I have run into enemy's who run through rail's and rush my healers. And the worst in my opinion is the garbage michanic where an enemy oneshot's you or many of your teamates out the gate for what seems like no apperant reason.

If you are going to make a fight hard, do it legitimatly, even if that means giving those unique characters special abilitie's that make there power stronger for whatever reason, but it should not completly ignore the laws of nature in the game."
564,Fawlcon,56,3,0,2017-11-21,Recommended,"1,417.60","The good:  A very polished game, stunning graphics, voice acting, drop in-out co-op, multiple paths, re-play off the chain.  Game Master is a legitimate contender for Roll20 and like web sites for RPGs. They should try and copy what this game has done, but with more of a D&D rule system.    The bad:  If you like the PC doing the random save versus spells, you will not like the Magic and Physical armor combat.  This is not D&D rules.  Combat will always come down to keeping your armor up while trying to strip the enemies and using a bundle of crowd control to keep them from attacking you. I wish enemies scaled to your level. Example, if you fight hard enemies of superior level early, you will have a great challenge and might have to do multiple re-loads to winBUT later you go to areas you missed or should have hit earlier and completely walk over the enemies who are of lower level.  The mix:  Once you understand the game mechanics and accept them, you begin to understand how to win battles against superior AI opponents through solid strategy.   The meh: The PC AI is hit or miss.  While there are times the AI does smart counters to your efforts, often it is the AIs lack of intelligence that allows you to overcome those odds and cheapens the victory.   I can boast that I finished the game and will likely do multiple runs. Second, I have completed a lavish GM campaign that I will post in the workshop, so I have a complete understanding of the game.

5,Purrmaid,650,401,5,2017-11-22,Recommended,149.3,"It seems I've never written a review for D:OS2, and with the Steam Awards wanting us to update a review, I might as well!  Let me start by stating that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is my all time favorite game. I adored the first one. I'm worshippping the second.  This isn't a game that'll hold your hand, this isn't a game that's easy and laid back. This is the game that throws you in the middle of a world and tells you to figure it out.   It has multiple difficulty settings, so if tactical turnbased combat isn't your strongest suit there ARE easier modes for you! But the harsh combat isn't the only thing that makes this game hard. It's the quests, the world, there is NO handholding. You got to figure out what to do, you got to figure out which quest to solve and focus on. And boy are there many quests to focus on!  Some seem absolutely random, some seem like just a typical sidequest kind of job that ends up being the key ingredient in solving the big mystery! I love that, I love that the first act has you stuck on an island, a jail, and your job is to break out. And how would one do this? There isn't just one way, or two, or three. There are more than that. Way more. And it's up to you to figure out the way.   There are five races, human, dwarf, elf, lizard, and undead. Each brings with their own talents and experience in the game. You might have trouble with certain quests because they hate your race, you might need to find another way into a town because they don't like dwarves. It's extremely immersive, and playing it as a coop makes it even so.   I'm not sure I have words to describe to you how amazing this game is. I like difficult games, I played this on Tactical, which is hard, and on some boss fights me and my coop partner would sit here for two hours. Reloading. Repositioning. Changing skills. Reloading. over and over untill we finally managed to beat said boss. It was one of the most amazing experiences I've had in gaming all year. Just that little bit of having to figure out how something works.  There are Character Tags and Talents that you can choose that really makes this into an immersive rpg. Pet Pal allows you to talk to animals. That sad dog over there, cheer him up and he'll help you. That nasty fire elemental? Guess what! She needs your help! You can have a talent that makes you stink, and people dislike you because of it.   Larian Studios is a dev team to follow. I cannot wait to see what comes next. (Voice acting wasn't in the original budget. There was partial voice acting, but somehow they managed to make the entire game voice acted, without starting another kickstarter and without pushing the game back a few months. It was a surprise untill launch and I give them major props for doing this)"
337,DurkaDog,300,5,0,2017-11-22,Recommended,253.7,"This game is a change in the right direction in the game industry, these past few years many game companies have been abusing their power for more marketing and microtransactions thus ignoring their communities for what they want. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a turn-based, RPG, tactical combat game for up to 4 players where you have many possiblies to play as different roles in well driven story as a savior among the people. What shocked me the most was when I found out that this game was brought up by a kickstarter. Finding out that Larian Studios conisisted of 130 employees baffled me that AAA games could be so corrupted by greed that it ruins the gameplay and to have a series like Divinity whose company focuses on develping their games rather than trying to polish it up for marketing purposes puts all AAA games to shame."
399,Rumbeef,"1,115",4,0,2017-11-22,Recommended,175.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game that had me constantly feeling as though I was getting to the point that I was powerful, and then they threw a curveball at me.  It kept me exploring and eating at the edges of quests that I would have to return to later when I was more experienced.  Throughout the game I came up to walls that I had to search for ways around or over, it seemed like the game was always ready for me.  It felt rewarding to figure out something, to get past an enemy who had stopped me before, to try something different with my skills and abilities.    I hadnt played any Divinity games before and they had a good way of bringing me into the world theyve crafted, individual party members had interesting motives and I felt like our interactions were dependant on my input.  The story had a good thread pulling me towards the conclusion of the game and kept me wondering where it was taking me.    I like turn based combat because it usually feels like Im responsible for what happens throughout combat, and Divinity has a few ways to have unexpected actions unravel your plans.  The elemental system worked well for this, combining a few different spells could make a whole area a minefield, or clear it by using alternatives.  I didnt utilize all the systems, other than a few items I never had to touch crafting and rarely used potions.  The items and loot were enough to have an impact on my builds and I was usually able to get gear I wanted from either quests or vendors.  There are enough abilities and types of play that I could see a second or third run being very different than how I played through the first time.  I only played a little multiplayer, but I enjoyed how we were able to work together to rob and murder people, something I can never bring myself to do when I play solo.  I think they found a good balance around doing turn based rpg combat"

There are secrets to be found everywhere, all of which give you loot, advance the plot, or reveal something about a character's backstory.

1046,JP,273,2,0,2017-11-23,Recommended,37.2,"First, let me say that this is my first Turn-based RPG ever. I did not expect this game to be as good as it is.  Right from the start, as you level up, you can feel that the levels matter and you actually need to level up if you want to proceed in the game. Same thing happens with your gear. You really need to find some better gear in order to win some battles.   The battles feel very challenging and therefore rewarding when you actually beat them. It feels good when you come up with a strategy and you win after countless of losses. (Experience may vary :D)  I like the characters. Every character seems to have a personality (even the animals!) and they seem well written. This is the first game I've played that has a narrator too! That's cool as he can really paint the picture for you because the characters don't really have good animations for every emotion or so in these top-down RPG's  Graphics look good for but I'd like a better antialiasing as MSAAx1 is not enough. Otherwise this game looks amazing. Lot's of cool places to discover and stunning vistas. The soundtrack is good too, the game lets you decide which type of music do you want to hear when you make your character. I recommend finding the soundtrack in YouTube and listening it.   I can't really think of cons because I don't have anything to complain (yet)."

That's one main reason why i wouldn't in my right mind reccomend it. For i fear you will also lose a fair amount of your week to week life from this game also.   However my sole reason for writting this review in the first place. Is that due to some unforeseen error. (that i can only assume is either divine intervention or just the worst luck possible) Your camera can lock perminantly into darkness. Note this is only if you having a super fun time with your perma-death difficulty enabled characters in split-screen mode. (it's rumoured to be whenever your playing split screen mode you run a risk of this, it has only happened twice so far to be fair however the entirety of your save file is thereforth unplayable).   So as I was saying(ranting, excuse the emotional nature of my review, me and my freind have just lost all progress of a finely tuned epic playthrough due to an error we can't fix no matter what we've tried.) So to contuine forth in our playing of the game would be to admit we don't care for the 40+ hours that it has taken us to get to this point.   You will most likely enjoy this game if you have ever played a turn based game prior or enjoy Dungeons and Dragons. However let me reiterate the reason I am not reccomending it, is due to the sheer heart break that may be fall you if you happen to become prey to the same bug.   (which I'm more than 100% certain is simply the camera deciding it wants to go subteranian and never reapear again)  To summerise     -Great Game    -Not worth the time  "
84,Tuco,750,80,7,2017-11-25,Recommended,336.6,"Divinity: original Sin 2 is a strong contender to ""Game of the Year""  and with few meaningful tweaks it could easily compete to rank among the best RPGs of all time.  Like for its predecessor, its strong points are the massive amount of player agency permitted, one of the best turn-based combat systems in the business, a great degree of environmental interaction and very solid encounter design.  Disappointingly enough, this sequel fails mostly in the same area that hindered its predecessor: itemization and stat bloat. Larian's stubbornness with randomized loot over unique and hand-placed items means you'll never get rewards that are meaningful, just generic items that can drop anywhere or pop in any merchant's inventory at any given time. That kills a lot of incentives to bring down strong enemies, solve quests and explore for hidden treasures: when every action can potentially get the same outcome, it doesn't really feel like accomplishments matter that much.  On top of that, the problem with stat bloat emerges few hours into the game. While the problem presents itself from the beginning (by the time you'll get all the pieces of the first armor set in the starting area they'll be completely obsolete), it becomes genuinely grating past level 14-15, as you'll quickly get to the point where the jump in values at each level will be so ridiculous you'll literally double your HP/damage/armor values, etc. This essentially forces (well, strongly encourages) the players to replace ALL the equipment for his entire party at every level up.  That's not just annoying and a bit pace-breaking, but it also has the not irrelevant side effect to make you feel like no piece of equipment you'll find, no matter how strong at that given moment, gives you any long-term value.   There were surely better ways to handle these aspects, even just looking at the past. This game with the Baldur's Gate 2 itemization could have been a all-times classic."

I'd definitely recommend hard difficulty for experienced tactical players. On the other hand, the story pulls you in. There are a lot of side quests, puzzles, and mysteries as well.    At the beginning were the predefined characters not that interesting to me, but with time they grew to my heart. And seriously, every single NPC dubbed? With branching conversations? That's every rpg player's dream come true. So be prepared to read a lot too. Or not, that's up to you.    Combat? Feels very fluent and very similar to a combat from the first game. But now some skills can be better combined and create a potential for your cunning. For example: with Hydrosophist and Necromancer you can make Raining Blood - which creates blood surfaces, sets bleeding on enemies and douses fire surfaces - and those blood surfaces you can further electrify or freeze, or simply walk on it with blood sucker for some healing.   Music? Masterpiece by Borislav Slavov.  TL;DR: Like fantasy RPG and tactics? Get your best friends/partners and get it right now! "

My only complaint is that the GM mode is not as good as it should be. I wish it had been setup as a campaign editor, allowing you to set dialogue, even if its text only.

1793,Agarwaen,66,2,0,2017-11-26,Recommended,194.2,"If I were to qualify this game with the fewest amount of words possible, I'd say 'Frustratingly addictive'. For a more detailed breakdown, please read below.  The positives: Divinity: Original Sin 2 has an interesting and engaging story. If you play with some of the origin characters, your experience will be even richer.  The game is rendered in a beautiful engine, enriching the expirience even further. The world of Rivellon is very detailed and vast, offerring a lot of opportunities to wonder off the beaten path. Exploration is rewarded with hidden treasure, encounters etc.  Combat really shines with tactical options.  The negatives: For a newcomer to this franchise this game felt really frustrating at times, especially during combat. It seems that most enemies you face have mobility skills and ranged attacks, which your party may lack in the beginning.  Ths story felt really complex and there were cases where I no longer understood which allegiance I should honor.  Overall, I would still recommend anyone who enjoys RPGs to give D:OS 2 a try. Despite some of its flaws it is a solid role playing game.  PS. Is it me, or the UI looks a lot like Diablo 3?"

There are discords dedicated to finding and hosting groups, no need to hope for a reply on the steam forums or join random groups in the browser. It's so much more enjoyable, but frustrating at the same time. Learn to love fort joy, as you'll be restarting many times. It took me good ~30 groups to find someone to finish the game with. Thankfully (and sadly) first act is the best made one, and there's a lot to do there.   Main reason why I would recommend this game is not it's story, or some innovative features and approaches, but it's replayability. Even 300+ hours in I found combat enjoyable, each fight a challenge, with a chance to ???? up. There are some rather clever mechanics to learn and abuse, unique skills to master, builds to optimize and routes to find.   The game is well worth your money and time, despite it's shortcomings.   Speaking of which... Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of things wrong with the game. From expected (but not liked) bugs and glitches - on my last playthrough we had at least 3 bugged quests, a bunch of issues with stuck characters and desyncs - to more serious problems.   Story is passable at best. It will not keep you awake or amaze you in the end. Sidequests are often more engaging than the main plot line.   Armor system is very restricting for the most of the game, especially on the higher difficulties. It pretty much forces you in to using only physical or magical (typically physical) damage, as you need to strip the armor before controls can be used, and controls are mandatory for the most of the game. Yes, sure eventually you can get one spell room clearing mages, but that's late game, and that's not what you will be doing most of the time.

There is also serious lack of skills, or variety, to be precise. It's fine for first game, but later you start to notice it more. And so many skills are very situational, or subpar, so you generally use ~5 constantly and a few for utility. It's specially notable between melee classes, as a rogue, knight(2h weapons), warrior(sword and board) and metamorph will use the same warfare skills, as they are core to being a melee, and not their ""subclass"" variations. There are also crafted skills, combining 2 schools, but combinations are between magical and physical schools, meaning you will rarely even see them.   There is very little to do outside of combat, except preparing for combat or picking up quests before you go fight stuff for the quests. A bit lacking from a cRPG.   Several of the systems feel unfinished, lacking purpose. Crafting seems like a huge part of the game initially, but you only really craft runes and lockpicks. Potions, scrolls, food and grenades quickly become useless, even healing potions are disappointing in the endgame. Scrolls hold up the longest, but not the offensive one, only the ones that can remove status effects. NPC attitude value is a glorified discount program.   AI ""cheats"" a lot. No one will suspect you as an undead (or having the zombie trait) outside of combat, but once initiated, get ready to receive all the healing spells. And they will forget it immediately after. Enemies will know where exactly to move, to avoid a minefield of line of sigh obstacles and smoke blockers, just to get that single possible shot on their turn.   But all of that said, I still enjoyed the hell out of my time with the game. Sure, maybe the abysmal state of PC gaming this year and lack of good RPG games in general is partially to blame, but I think there's more to it.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a game they can immerse themselves in."
358,myhv,121,5,0,2017-11-27,Recommended,613.6,"It's ok for a few evenings...   But seriously, where do I even start? Probably with the best advice I can give: play this in multiplayer! There are discords dedicated to finding and hosting groups, no need to hope for a reply on the steam forums or join random groups in the browser. It's so much more enjoyable, but frustrating at the same time. Learn to love fort joy, as you'll be restarting many times. It took me good ~30 groups to find someone to finish the game with. Thankfully (and sadly) first act is the best made one, and there's a lot to do there.   Main reason why I would recommend this game is not it's story, or some innovative features and approaches, but it's replayability. Even 300+ hours in I found combat enjoyable, each fight a challenge, with a chance to ???? up. There are some rather clever mechanics to learn and abuse, unique skills to master, builds to optimize and routes to find.   The game is well worth your money and time, despite it's shortcomings.   Speaking of which... Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of things wrong with the game. From expected (but not liked) bugs and glitches - on my last playthrough we had at least 3 bugged quests, a bunch of issues with stuck characters and desyncs - to more serious problems.   Story is passable at best. It will not keep you awake or amaze you in the end. Sidequests are often more engaging than the main plot line.   Armor system is very restricting for the most of the game, especially on the higher difficulties. It pretty much forces you in to using only physical or magical (typically physical) damage, as you need to strip the armor before controls can be used, and controls are mandatory for the most of the game.

For example: you stumble upon Z location, but in order to progress through the zone you need X item that is found in Y location.  Go to Y location.   In order to progress through Y location and obtain X item, you must travel to B location to do a quest and unlock a special ability. Go to B location to do said quest and obtain the special ability. Return to Y location, obtain X item, return to Z location.

264,Za,332,2,0,2017-11-29,Not Recommended,5.9,"This is more of a first impression review as I've not even finished the starting area but so far I'm not very impressed with how the game actually plays. I enjoy the story fine and the voice acting is wonderful though. But having just finished DOS 1 I'm very unhappy with the direction DOS 2 took in many ways.   As  a huge fan of the original DOS I find it bizarre how much the mechanics have changed. Combat isn't everything in this style of game but the changesa are so jarring I'm not sure I care to continue right now, and even if DOS 2 was the first I tried the combat system is just not much to my liking.  My biggest complaint is the weird Physical Armor and Magical Armor split. Unlike DOS 1 armor doesn't provide a flat % damage reduction and instead In DOS 2 everything has 3 Health bars, but before you can start chipping into the actual hit points of a target you have to eat through either Phyiscal or Magical armor with their respective damage types. This means having a split party of Mages and Fighters is really ineffecient as you'll be pushing through all three health pools instead of just two, doable yes, but way worse than just running 2 characters with the right skills and talents who focus on the same type of damage. There is no reward for party variety and in fact punishment for it.   Further the mechanics of both types of armor are even more of a hassle by blocking all status effects from taking effect until the armor pool broken. For example you can't stun someone with a shock spell until magical armor is depleted.  This includes, for some maddening reason, preventing any enemy who has an armor rating from being Taunted. So tanking isn't really much use. Speaking of tanking being not very useful, each enemy in the game will auto target your weaknesses and more often than not focus fire the lowest HP member of your party. You can actually learn to use this to your advantage but really it's just frustrating.   Also for vets of the first DOS the system has totally redone action points into a flat 4 per turn 6 points max, with only a few talents and spells modifying this at all. Not exactly a horrible change honestly but it doesn't feel ""right"" coming from the first game.   Honestly I'm going to take a break and play some other games and try to come back to DOS 2 with a more fresh perspective, but I'm still giving this a thumbs down for my own personal issues witht the combat system."

The problem for me, though, is that this game feels like a downgrade in nearly every respect from the first. The story isn't as interesting, the locations feel really bland (comparatively), combat is slower and worst of all the party interaction is simplistic at best.   One of the best things about Original Sin was that you and your partner built a relationship and history together as the game went on. You had arguments about what to do in a quest and could discuss the outcomes afterwards. Over time you began to develop your own tropes. It wasn't perfect by any means, but it was far better than what you get with Original Sin 2. This game allows for 4 player co-op, which is awesome. I was really excited when I heard the announcement about that. The problem is, however, that they really had to sacrifice a lot for characterization to accomidate that. All the pre-made characters have their own quest lines and stories, sure. But you have essentially no influence on the character, your dialogues feel meaningless and what you do in a quest is entirely your own decision. There are no group decisions. It's every man for himself, which leads me to the biggest problem.  As I said before Original Sin had you both discuss quest paths and if there was a disagreement, you would do a paper rock scissors minigame to decide who won. Nothing ground breaking, but it worked. Your two characters were partners and worked together for a common goal. It was kind of campy at times, but it made for a really fun and light hearted setting. Enter Original Sin 2. Not only does it not encourage working together, it in fact encourages the opposite. There are options that will only benefit one person. There are plot points that flat out tell you, ""Only one person can win."" It sets you against one another from the beginning. It might be interesting for some people, but I personally hated it. Coming from Original Sin where I loved the cooperative element, I hated that the game actively encouraged people to put themselves first. It might sound interesting at first, but I guarantee it really sucks to have to play a RPG where people start ignoring the story so that they can loot everything in sight before others get there first.  The tone of Original Sin 2 is much different from Original Sin. In fact, the exact opposite. Original Sin had a pretty light hearted campy feel to it. Pretty much every option felt like it had a good enough outcome if you put in the effort to get it. Original Sin 2, however, is a bleak and depressing setting. The people in the world are generally terrible and there are very few happy moments ever available. There are many quest lines that actually just turn a sad situation worse even if you go through all the effort to finish everything. The story feels completely hopeless and it eventually had me choosing to do as little as possible for questing.  As for the combat, they made magic a bit more accessible to people. There are more schools of magic and more abilities for you to choose from. It's interesting enough. But once again they made it worse, I think, from Original Sin. They basically halved your action points (AP) in this game. So you have less moves available in a turn. Then they added two types of defense. Physical and Magic. In order to do health damage, you have to bring one defense down to 0 and then hit with an attack of that damage type. So if you want to kill somebody with a sword, you have to get their physical armor to 0 and then hit them. Or if you want to kill somebody with a fireball, you have to get their magical armor to 0 and then hit them. All of this is done so that certain status ailments cannot be applied while certain armors are up. For instance, burning will first reduce magic armor before it takes health away. Same with stunning and knockdown. All this does is make combat feel like a chore. Before you can do anything to hurt anybody, you have to get their defenses down. But your moves are severely limited so you can maybe attack twice if you stand completely still and have max AP. It's slow and much less fun.  Most of this review was comparing Original Sin 2 to Original Sin and saying 'the first one was better.' And I think it was. If you haven't played Original Sin then you will probably really enjoy Original Sin 2. But for me Original Sin 2 was a huge letdown compared to the first. This is a good game but it's a big step back. I love this studio and I really, really hope to see an Original Sin 3 or some other CRPG from them in the future. With the success of Original Sin 2, I'm sure we will. I just hope they manage to bring back all the good they did with the first Divinity Original Sin."
54,Myzzy,235,14,3,2017-12-02,Not Recommended,133.6,"If you want a quality game without tons of random nuances, please buy the Divinty: Original Sin 1. This game butchered a lot of that game's charm, but quickly cut off its face and wore it around as a facade. Sourcery feels flat and weak, and almost entirely pointless at times due to it just being sucked out of you like nothing by most every enemy you come across (not to mention they're oftentimes weak and eat your AP like no tomorrow when you can do comparable damage or effects for the same amount AP). Some of the combat scenarios you will go through are also just tedious and can take upwards of an hour and a half per fight even when you are spending less than two minutes per character turn.  Slight Edit: The difficulties are also superficial in their differences. Tactician spouts on about in its description about how enemies have special effects and think more about their moves. In truth, the enemies have double your base stats: double vitality, phys. and magic armor, and quite often double your damage. They also commonly outnumber you meaning that you are up??????creek without a paddle. The first voidwoken you spot upon landing on the beach have ""vampire"" which lets them lifesteal damage they do. Some enemies have a bonus spell that 'spices' things up (usually a summon or something else of the sort that also has double your stats). It's not even a fair way to play the game, because you often have to abuse game mechanics and essentially cheat with quicksaves and quickloads to get anywhere. I am by no means a noob at this game either. I played a coop save with a friend in the first original sin where we both picked lone wolf, which rendered us locked to a two man party. We functioned as a team and got through the playthrough easy peasy as a first playthrough. That was a fair challenge. This game's difficulties are nothing more than jokes to play on people expecting a tactical difference in how the AI functions.  The biggest kicker, and the most apparent reason for my negative review is that the game is HORRIBLY optimized for Radeon cards. I have an AMD Radeon R9 Fury Sapphire and it absolutely begins to cook under the pressure of this game's coding. Within six minutes of starting the game, mind you this is only at the main menu, my graphics card's temperature jumps from 54 degrees Celsius to 72 degrees. Six minutes. On the menu. I have a water cooling system and near to seven fans in my PC that are all optimized to keep my tower as cool as possible. For comparison, I can play Doom on Ultra graphics at 1920x1080 resolution for hours without my PC trying to become an easy bake oven. The problem persists even on the lowest graphics settings as if it just wants to fry my GPU (once again, something that happens in no other game regardless of graphics settings). This game is absolutely a hog, and even the devs know it because they always talk about needing to remove peripherals from your USB or shutting off all non-essential programs. What is this: a pre-flight check-up? Just program your game better and give AMD cards a fair chance with optimization.  This problem is not just me either. Many other AMD users, based on community posts, support tickets, and forum posts, have had similar issues are just being flat-out unable to play the game because it crashes their graphics drivers. If you are an AMD user, avoid this game and buy its predecessor- a game you will enjoy far more. This might seem like pointless ranting, but as a consumer who has tested multiple things to adjust how this game functions. When I can't even play the game with my friends for more than a couple hours at a time (and at risk for damaging my PC) then this game has serious problems."

For 33 USD (For the deluxe edition), this game offers a lot more than most AAA titles in the past months, or even years. This review is here to hopefully show you how much you NEED this game. (Note: Not all the games content is able to fit into one review, so I will try to keep this as short as possible.)                                                     DIVINITY: ORIGINAL SIN 2 Review (Spoilers Ahead)   Story:  I have played a few modern  RPGs in my life. Mass Effect, Dragon Age, SWOTR, Skyrim, Fallout, Phantasy Star, Final Fantasy, but none of them really hold a candle to how much content and diversity this game contains. The story itself is continued after the events of Original Sin, but taake place hundreds of years after, meaning that there is no need to play the original to know what happens here. You play as a Sourcerer, a being able to tap into the misterious Source to use powers that are deemed too dangerous for the public.   I won't go too in detail on that, but from there, your journey begins. When I say ""your"" I don't really mean JUST your character that you made for the game, but YOU as well. This game makes YOU an integral part of the story, not just your character. You can traverse the world and do whatever you want.   The best part of the story is that it is non-linear. Hell, the entire game isn't linear, but I'll get to that. Any and EVERY choice that you make has an impact on, not just the story itself, but the lives of everybody around you, and it shows. The story can be played hundreds of times and still feel fresh. Different ""tags"" that you get/use (talked about in character customization) allow you to interact with people differently. What race you choose also makes a huge impact on how characters interact with you.   In this game, there are 6 different ""origin characters"" that allow you to experience their story through their point of view. I haven't done this myself (having only 38 hours into the game at the time of this review) but it is interesting to see the world through their eyes. If you don't want to, you can always use your own character and recruit them as ""allies.""  Note that in this game, your companions stories play out alongside yours. Choices will have to be made. Thats all I'm saying about that.  This game also allows for friends to enter your game alongside you. Many different things can happen, and you may end up fighting each other if you decide against it.   Quests can be found anywhere, especially NPC's. Depending on your choices however, they may be harsher to you, or maybe even not give you the quest in the first place.    Character Customizations:  This is arguably the least amazing thing in the game, which is saying something because it is still better than most other RPG creation systems. You can customize anything from a persons style, to their tags (which are sort of like occupations, which affect the story and dialogue.) It is here that you can also choose what class you are going to be. I won't go into too much detail, but know that choosing a class doesn't mean that you stay that class forever. You can spec your character into whatever class you want. One should note however that your beginning weapon is determined by your class.  You can also choose your atributes and skills in this section. Note that these affect your beginning character, and possibly your end game character if you stay on the road that you started.    Combat:  The flexibility of the story applies to combat as well. There are dmany different skills that you can choose from, which can be learned using books. Note that it is impossible to learn a skill if you don't have the right stats for it. There are many different ways a battle can go.. especially since the AI is good on higher difficulties.   There are different elements that can be used to your advantage. These elements give different debuffs to your oponents, but not all of them are effective as there are resistances. With the introduction of Divinity Original Sin 2 comes armor. These values are found on top of the health bar, and they serve the purpose of negating any and all debuffs, so you need to take care of that first.   In this game, you might notice some elements on the ground. If you happen to hit it either with a skill or basic attack, it turns into something different. For example, if an enemy is standing on a pudddle, you can use an electricity skill to stun them and cause them to lose a turn. Or, if they are standing on oil, using fire would cause an explosion, dealing damage as well as DOT. The possibilities are endless.   The only limit to combat is how many action points you have. This can be increased with the use of armor and skills, but I won't get too into that.    Music/Voice Acting:  For a game that almost didn't have voice acting, it is done pretty damn well. Every character is fully voiced. With a certain perk that even allows you to talk to and get quests from animals. Its 100% amazing. Over 1,000,000 lines of dialogue was recorded for this game, and each one really pushes the game along  The music is superb. Both thematic and atmospheric, it really helps immerse you in the world of Divinity. You can even choose which of 4 instruments will be playing during the game. It is amazing.   Mods and Downloads:  Aside from all of this content, Larian has decided that this game needed mods. They also allowed players to make their own stories using the ingame assets, which, for a 33 dollar game is astounding. While I would say that mods and downloads aren't NEEDED for the game to be amazing, it really adds to the replayability of the game as a whole. Note that using mods will disable achievements for the game, so you achievement hunters out there will need to play without them.   Multiplayer:  Sometimes, it gets a little lonely, so playing with friends is an option, and in my opinion, a MUST TRY. You can play with up to 4 players online, and 2 on split screen (YES THERE IS SPLITSCREEN.) They can help you do many things... of which I shouldn't spoil. You can even sabotage them when fighting, and you can even initiate PVP with them.   Speaking of PVP, there is a designated area for such, where you team up with others in order for you to kill your oponents. I haven't played the game mode myself, but it does look fun.    Closing Thoughts:  BUY THIS ALREADY. "

I have never in my life seen a game so completely ruined in the final act as this game. I didn't even finish the first playthrough because of the last fight which was beyond my capabilities. Despite this, I put together a new team and went through it again (all mage this time). Yes I'm stupid.   This game eats away your time. It doesn't value it at all. You will waste so much time re-moving characters because they don't want to go through some measly poison or fire that they'll heal from right away. You'll waste time on every save / reload - at least 30 seconds on saves and 1 minute or more on reloads. You'll waste time reskilling your characters because you remove a piece of equipment. You'll waste time trying to target a character when your entire screen is covered in cursed fire. You'll waste time with quests that you can't complete (I can't believe that Tarquin bug still isn't fixed on my 2nd playthrough despite so many assurances on release notes). You'll waste time & get carpal tunnel with all the mouse moving to close windows that obscure you view. You'll waste time moving wares from one character to another because the designers choose to waste your time instead of just having one wares for the entire party. You'll waste time combining & recombining potions because they think that animations and sounds for one combine are so cool they couldn't possibley give you a button that will COMBINE ALL. You'll waste time when the battle is going on for minutes because the designers believe FIREBALLS should have a TURN.   It spits on your time, it constantly makes you waste your time and you perservere & trudge through it and then it completely vomits over all you have done & accomplished in the final act.   I'm talking about MULTIPLE stupid ?????? battles -  and you'll spend so much time reading how to get through these  stupid ?????? battles just to cheese them to progress and even those will be wrong.

The combat is engrossing, satisfying, and keeps you talking. You are encourged to work together and experiment, and the massive freedom of choice in the game means you'll never know what someone is going to get your party into. However, that same freedom can also mean that you aren't always clear on the ""right"" way to go, so you might spend some time exploring or consulting guides. You can always make your own path if you want to though.   There were a few odd bugs. One of my friends was having issues with his inventory just dissapearing. Reloads didn't fix it and he was unable to use any items. During combat, things aren't always crystal clear on what you can hit and what is in range, so sometimes you just have to wing it. It usually works out though. Not many complaints from me on this one, it'll go down as one of my fondest multiplayer experiences ever. Thanks to the devs for giving me great times with my friends."

24,AshtonTheMelon,153,69,11,2017-12-05,Not Recommended,101.7,"I put this game as the most heart-breaking non-recommendation of any game I have ever played. I will try to explain why I feel this way below.  First and foremost, this game is a buggy mess. Many people have reported otherwise, but for me personally quests breaking, dialog boxes glitching out, character's and choices not lining up sometimes, it just feels like you are playing a beta. Hell, the beta I played felt more completed.  This game brands itself as a classic rpg experience, but also doesn't know if it wants to railroad you or let you explore to it's contents. With the way the game's quest system is set up, simple discovery of things won't always intitate quests, and if it does, they are partial and don't provide any context unless you look up a guide. What? A weird enemy is speaking your name and talking to you and then it attacked you? Oh, you killed it? Welp, the quest can't be intitated now. All for mute. Exploration is nearly down right punished unless you explore the *correct* way.  The game's combat system is great, or it would be if it weren't for it's overbloated stats. This literally makes one or two levels a difference between going through a cake walk or having the most frustrating experience you will ever had. A lot of boss fights, looking at you final fight, are just down right poorly designed. And I will talk about the ending portion of this game in a minute, but I personally was on level, with a fairly diverse party, healer/magic user, ranger, tank, and two-handed death knight, and I was still struggling against enemies who""just out paced me in numbers alone. Regardless of the best armor you can buy or find at that level, the best spells or gear you use, the enemy will 9/10 feel like they are constantly beating the??????out of you. Which is fun and challenging some of the time, but if cheesing a victor, which is what a lot of people on the forums recommend, is the way to win a fight, then that is a bad design.  The game's skills are also fairly poor. One in particular being persuasion. Unless you have a character that has points in that skill, good luck every getting a success. The game uses your stats ""Strength, Constitution, Memory"", and what not as the base of whether you will have an easier time successing in that dialog. Except, it doesn't tell you, that unless you have points in the ""Persuasion talent"" you will fall 9/10. Considering you can't put the person with the persuasion points in every bit of dialog, it's a flaw.  Inventory management gets ridiculious later on in the game. Weapons and items you achieve, do to the bloated stat system, get out paced dramatically, most ""important"" items are garbage, one specifically I will adress in a minute. A lot of characters and elements of the story are never clearly defined or expanded upon. They just throw it at you and hope it sticks. Good writing doesn't need to explain itself to give you an understanding, that isn't the case here. Hell, the narrator of the game, the one who starts the whole game off, seems like an important character, but she only appeared a few times in my game and her quest was never resolved. Yet, in the end sequence, she is described as someone I should feel sympathy for when all she did was try and kill me.  A lot of choices *don't* matter. It's just an illusion. And some choices are just down right better than anything else.  And so much more.  But I could forgive all of that. There are an astounding amount of small issues that just build and build, but I could forget all of it, because there is sooooo much to love in this game. The writing and characters can be great, the music and world are something you love exploring, and the combat can be fun and exciting.  But.  The sad eeeeing excuse this game calls an ending, the mess of writing, the end fight, and the actual bug that occured for me, justeeeeeeeeme off. It was insulting.   SPOILERS AHEAD  The last act of this game is a mess. Filled with inconsistencies, missing plot threads, vague comments, lack of direction, and a eeeeee resolution to add to it. One big example of this is Anathema. I gathered the parts for it in the previous act because the idea of a talking sword sounded promising. The man creating it, Tarquin, says speak to him later about it's assembly. You ask him, and he says it will be ready when it's ready. APPEARANTLY, you have to find an UNRELATED note, in a random vault that describes this one character you have seen twice is actually Braccrus Rex, and only THEN can he give you this weapon. It's an OP weapon (or at least it is suppose to be), has the best stats in the game, but one durablity and will break after a single hit. Except, despite it being sold to you as this Anti-Braccrus weapon, it barely does anything to him. It will deal a chunk of his armor or health, but any skill you use will only get one hit off before it breaks as Larian patched it so that it could break if used with skills. So now it is completely useless.  But on to the final confrontation. I played as Fane, repeling the sins of my past the entire game, despite it wanting me to pray to the God King. I wouldn't. My friends, Ifan and The Red Prince, trusted me to become divine and my lover, Lohse (probably the only thing that kept me in this game was her excellent character) agreed as well. We get to the final fight and we discover the person we have been chasing all this time, Dalis, is my daughter. Can't interact with her at all beyond that. You are then given a choice, Surrend and destroy the world's source, turning all of the world into husks, or fight to the bitter end. I chose to fight.  You then get into a fairly difficult boss battle where, after beating a single enemy, that isn't defined so good luck figuring it out, you are then thrust into a MORE difficult boss battle, with respawning bo"

Divinity 2 rarely presents you with black and white moral choices, and a simple slip of the tongue will see you losing loved ones fast.  The combat is challenging, in a good way. It allows you to customize your party completely and make logical and creative decisions in combat that you don't really expect to work but then they totally have an effect you weren't expecting....  ...that is why this game is perfection. Every time I pushed at the borders of the game to see if I could get away with something, I realised the border wasn't there... so I pushed harder and got more creative...

Story:              9.5/10 Gameplay:      9.5/10 Graphics:        9/10 Creativity:       10/10 Polished:         9.5/10  (lack of bugs I encountered) Elf Skeleton & Human Skeleton male coitus...  10/10? There is something for everyone in this game...  (I thought the character dialogue was joking about actually being attracted to one-another so I jokingly went along with some banter later to find my character partook in some very un-intended interactions that left me wondering how it got to that level.)

If you take your time and familiarize yourself with the concepts and systems of this game, you will enjoy one of the most engrossing, enjoyable, well written, and enjoyable RPG's ever. The combat let's you get creative and do just about anything in a variety of ways.

NPC says you should team up to kill a common enemy? Be prepared for them to focus only you over the literal end of the world.  Quest puzzle? Why bother, it was never finished and you can just lockpick the reward.  Why even raise someone in combat when the AI, allies included sometimes, will focus fire them to death before you get your turn to heal them.  Save too often? Save bloat can break your save and it's unfixable.  Want to pass a speech check? Whoops, the game keeps selecting a character who you didn't level persuasion on so you can't.   The freedom is amazing early on, but it becomes quickly apparent that the last Act wasn't bug tested or balanced at all.  If the final Act was actually fixed and low on bugs, I'd recommend it, but as it is there's just a frustrating, unfun slog through Arx to capstone what started as a fun RPG.  The last 20% of the game is a garbage fire that ruins a fun adventure."

Harkening back to the golden era of Fallout, Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate and the likes, it fully deserves to stand alongside those greats.   It's hard to explain how enjoyable the game is. It refines and improves almost everything from the original Divinity: Original Sin. The attention to detail, environments, quests, voice acting, combat, etc are all fantastic. The addition of multiplayer is absurdly fun and just the sheer variety the game offers is something else entirely. It's such a smooth RPG experience but so polished, and still retains the things that made old school CRPGs so great. Everything comes together to make this atmospheric experience, from the music to the writing and to the mechanics themselves.   The best game I've played in some time and an absolute must-buy for any RPG fan."

159,applekwisp,332,25,3,2017-12-14,Recommended,101,"Great RPG, probably one of the best games of 2017. It's strengths lie in an amusing colorful world, with and intresting, serious, yet lighthearted fantasy setting. The game is actually very rough around the edges the longer you play. It's polish runs out in the last 2 chapters as they feel rushed and maybe even unfinished. The difficulty curve of the game feels off since near the start it's very challenging, but towards the end you will become an unstoppable killing machine. Though there were many improvements over the first game, I still felt the first game had a better, focused story, better armor system, combat system (AP management) and pacing.  Pros  Lengthy RPG  Large variety of skills and character customization options  Dialogue is fun an intresting, a lot of world building in game  Combat is fun (though flawed). World skills like teleporting, pyramids, pickpocketing are intresting  Combat is very strategic (almost to a fault)  Very fair price for content. 100 hour playthrough doing every single quest I could. Cons  (Pro and Con I think) Teleport becomes a less useful skill in this game because of the availability of so many movement abilities to everyone.  A lot of broken achievements. Examples: pray at every altar on nameless isle, the quests associated with sebille, fane, most companions i assume  New armor system is bad. Encourages stacking either physical or magical damage. Late game it becomes irrelvant, everything is a one shot fest or everyone has an ability to completely strip your armor/magic resist  AP system is too limited compared to first game  Too many status effects and they are inconsistent. For example Rupture tendons can be used against armor, but bleeding will be blocked  Literally every battle will end covered in necrofire/fire. It makes bless a useless skill since it will ALWAYS be overwritten.  Source skills useless for first 2 areas, since you will never have enough source to use them (and wonder if they are worth saving for a truly difficult part that never comes) and overpowered for the rest of the game. Makes for a boring mechanic considering how central to the plot it is. Bless, source vampirism, and spirit vision aren't really compelling godwoken abilities honestly.  The story kind of forgets itself in the 2nd area. The game feels like a means to explore and do fun RPGeque quests, but the plot takes a backseat to it.  The final act feels unfinished. I felt like I ran into solutions to quests accidently more often than the ""correct"" way. Final battle and final choices don't feel like they were explained or fleshed out.  (EARLY SPOILER)The compnaion interaction with the game feels to forced. Everyone you meet is one of the most important people in the world. The companions who you don't pick early on, continuously show up even though you have no attachement to them at all.  Crafting, like in the first game, is exceptionally bad. You can never preview what the recipe is going to make. The receipe UI is super cluttered. Exiperimentaion is cumbersome. It's mostly luck based guessing, with a few ""skill books"". Good luck sorting through the UI with no search function or filters to get anything useful. Ignore the crafting system completely despite there being decent receipes like boots + nails, or status immunity potions. Overall a great game probably the GOTY, but I would reccomend people give the first game a chance beacuse I truly believe it is the better title between the two. A few of the characters and plot points carry over so it's worth taking into consideration before playing this game regardless. I feel like after a few patches, maybe an expansion, this game can be fixed up to be almost perfect, but for DOS is still the best example of kickstarter success and a modern CRPG with a classic taste to it."

The original Original Sin was that kind of game.It had modernised CRPG mechanics,great combat,lots of choices on how to get on with the world,wonderful crafting yet cumbersome UI and a muddled story (even with the Enhancements later released)  Original Sin 2 tries to rectify all those mistakes. For my detailed review check this out:  http://indiannoob.in/divinity-original-sin-2-review-pc-noobreview-dungeons-dragons-and-mashed-potatoes/  +For starters, it has a more straightforward and darker storyline and writing. +The UI has been refined and is a lot more accessible +Character creation, customistaion, companions are all great. +General gameplay is still solid packing deep environmental interaction(in&out combat),fun crafting and exciting turn-based combat with good animations. +Classes are varied and many and balanced very well +Pretty much all lines are voice acted and they do a decent job.Same with the soundtrack +Challenging Tactician difficulty in which the game should be played (Normal being too easy) +Game Master mode for PnP RPG simulation and co-op is fun as always +Game looks great with a more grounded art style this time around +Mod Support   -I felt the streamlining of RPG attributes and skills from the first game is a bit of a let down (Although they allow less trial & error playthroughs) -The crafting seems to have been downplayed this time around.They have taken out the skills related to crafting and some fun recipes -Normal difficulty is way too easy,at least in the first chapter.  -Tactician mode felt cheap in some aspect like when it gives enemy ridiculous amount of physical and magical armor.In the first game,higher diffiiculty meant more enemies and smarter A.I.  TL:DR Orignal Sin 2 easily takes it's place as one of the greatest CRPGs ever along with Baldur's  Gate,Fallout,Wasteland,Planescape:Torment etc and at the same time possess mastery over it's technical aspects something the afforementioned games never did possess."

Graphic (despite the clunky character potraits) and sound are excellent and detailled.   Future rpgs have let themselves to be measured on what Larian Studios achieved here.   The last ~50% of the game (act3-5) sure seem a bit rushed. The magic of the first 2 acts is not entirely gone but fades until the game becomes from time to time slightly annoying in act 5.   Still one of the best ""classical"" rpgs I ever played.   And please change the either groupwide magic dmg or physical dmg concept. On higher difficulties it makes no sense to go with a mixed group.

1403,Prykie1995,235,2,0,2017-12-16,Recommended,141.8,"Can't sing this game's praises high enough. I begrudgingly bought it, largely out of principle, having heard of it being brilliant and that it was independently developed and published, thinking that I might not like it or give up on it. But I didn't, and now i'm here telling you to buy it.  I started the game up and thought it felt too slow, too cumbersome and somewhat bloated, with just the first area taking near enough half an hour to an hour to fully explore and understand what's going on. It got even worse when I got to the next area. ""god this drags on"" I was thinking, ""when's the proper fighting and loot fest stuff gonna happen?"" I thought. In hindsight, I definitely didn't understand the pace of the game and the focus of it at all. After having put in over 50 hours I can now say that this game, for what i've played, is a masterpiece.   It shares similarities with games like diablo or torchlight, but with mechanics and design choices that make you consider every little move you make, this game manages to scratch at more and more layers of depth and forces you to explore options you wouldn't otherwise if not for the firm but fair difficulty. The AI is clever. It doesnt just bash at you with anything/everything, it picks and chooses what it needs to do to take you down. It picks off the weak, avoids the strong and weakens the immovable by using the environment and the creatures therein to it's advantage. For instance, there is a skill in the game that let's you kill an enemy if your character dies. Having cast this, the enemy's allies, themselves unaffected by this skill, will avoid killing your character but WILL proceed to weaken and immobilise you so that when it wears off they can take you down. They work things like this out and have clear strategic formations you need to counter.  It's one of the most rewarding experiences: coming into a fight fully unprepared, as the underdog, only to walk out the other side the victor. You know it was because YOU made the critical choices needed to win that battle against the odds and against a genuinely THINKING cpu opponent. It's fantastic.  The way the game feels to play when you're fully invested is unparralleled. There is an absolute deluge of content if you seek to complete it all and the way the game gives you utter freedom to do whatever you want/need/can do is both daunting and refreshing at the same time. The difficulty is fine tuned to perfection, where small mistakes can be cleverly worked around but rushing can easily get you killed.   Take your time, learn the ropes and think about each and every move as if it's your last, that's when the game is at it's best.    BUY IT"

I can't even think of a similarly styled game that didn't utilize edge of screen orientation in the last 20 years. What is this, 1991? Having to use the home and delete keys to look around severely impedes immersion. Furthermore, it doesn't zoom out enough.  - No option to always run. In all the games I've played over the years, there was never a time where I wanted the avatar to just ""mozey"" to the desired destination. And because the camera is so claustrophobic, you have to click near the edge of the viewport to initiate the run sequence, even though you may not wish to run all the way to the edge.  It's akward and un-natural, and that destroys any chance for immersion for me personally. I'm going to try for a refund.  As for the story so far, it's cliche to the point of agitating. You start off in bondage. Have to escape. Whoah side quest go backwards and rescue poor helpless people. Yada yada. That's 8 out of 10 story lines.

The first encounter was with teleporting croc's who cast spells.  They took out my entire party in 4 turns.  I had 3 people in my group at the time.  I said the wrong thing to a guy named Griff in Fort Murder, my entire party killed in 3 turns.  It only got worse and worse and worse.  WHEN I did win a fight, it was like I lost.  I had to use half or more of my finite resources each fight.  Id get to a bigger, harder fight with nothing to help me.  You level slowly, gain little if nothing in loot, then die horrible over and over and over again.    The only redeeming quality is that the game knows your going to lose every fight, and autosaves before.  EDIT: Im editing this because of some of these comments calling me ""Trash"" or ""New/suck at game"" and want to tell me what I already know.  Divinity was an amazing game and I loved it.  The combats were hard, and could go sideways with a quickness.  That was fun to me, same with games like Pillars and Tyranny.    The biggest problem I have with this game is that the combat system is almost entirely predicated on status effects AKA Knockdown, petrify, atrophy, stunned ETC ETC.  BUT, you cant put those status effects on enemies until you completely remove there Physical or Magical armor.  At later levels, if the enemy goes first, your screwed.  Heck I have a lonewolf group that I put alternating points in Strength and Wits, has a 40+ initiative, never goes first.  Now if you can do enough damage, AND can go first, AND have enough action points you can actually DO something to the bad guys.  If not, your left standing there as they decimate you completely and by the time its your turn, several turns have past because they got through your magic and physical armor and applied turn ending status effects.  I have several groups of characters Ive taken to the first big town, past the Dallis boat fight.  None of them seem to have any chance against certain encounters.  And to the person who commented I just brute force my way through, without doing any sidequests.  Well I just watched a couple walkthroughs and realized that I have been doing nothing BUT sidequests.    I still dont know that I can recommend this game.  The story is amazing so far, but the combat and leveling has left something to be desired for me."

There is so much I haven't done, so much that I intend to do in my next playthrough with friends. I also haven't tried any mods, the game is apparently as close to open source as you can get and it's super moddable.   There are full dialogue options, numerous perspectives and angles to take. You can do so much in this game and it's filled with so much content, honestly puts many many games to shame...??????drenched shame.   My experience was as ""Malcador"" the undead necromancer polymorph battlemage who somehow also managed to keep people alive with minor side effects. I walked upon the sands to meet my companions, whom I would never part with. Beast, Red Prince, Ifan. We fought monsters, found our callings, and had kickass adventures.   In my darkest hour, with only myself remaining and surrounded by vicious enemies...I looked into my inventory and saw salvation...""Death Fog Barrel"" In that moment I knew what I had to do, I dropped the barrel and hit it hard, everything arround me was dead and there was much rejoicing. And that is how I defeated the chicken warriors of karrakdo'.

I did start on tactician and wasted a good 30 hours banging my head agains the wall, before I had to start over and lower the difficulty.

Classic and in some cases even explorer need a nerf, and new players will find this difficult, frustrating, and aggravating, because the game does such a terrible job explaining what you need, and pigeonholes you into cookie cutter min maxing just to survive the excessive difficulty.  I should point out that difficulty isn't dynamic or interesting, it's just monsters with scaled up HP/armor/damage, so fights just take longer, not become more interesting.  Story is ok but is miserably slow, intro is incredibly boring, you spend a good chunk of the early game in a ""who cares?"" mode because nothing interesting or compelling is happening.  It improves later on, though.  The only thing worse is the fanbase, which is full of ""git gud"" elitists who can't stop jerking the devs (and each other) off long enough to get over their fanboyism and admit this isn't that fun."

226,Lithbane,37,9,3,2017-12-24,Not Recommended,106.4,"I was gonna write this long post about what basically ruins this game for me. Again, my opinion, don't get triggered. I think this is the most overhyped and poorly made cashcow of a game ever. The devs were so lazy in making the quests that even murdering every NPC in all of Rivellon doesn't even matter, they just respawn in each act with crippling alzheimer's syndrome making them forget it all. I dropped a deathfog crate in act 4 on top of all the paladins and they just kept walking into it giving me that sweet, sweet EXP. Then some random paladin woman asked me if I was behind the murders, which of course I denied, being a lone wolf character on the hardest difficulty and having maxed out finesse because stacking archers in this game with finesse + wits is entirely broken in every way conceivable, especially when Fane can just grant himself another turn after the first and always be first because wits = initiative. And I succeeded in convincing her that I was, in fact, not behind the murders of her ENTIRE PALADIN ORDER because I had 5 in persuasion, basically the only stat you need to max out every time. This kind of??????happens throughout the entire game, with most NPC's literally being useless and lifeless with no character traits whatsoever. Combat is a complete joke, rogues/summoners/necromancers don't even need to exist. Polymorph needs 2 points to access every broken spell in the game. The entire game's story has these insanely stupid plotpoints that are supposed to be shocking, like Dallis being Fane's daughter (foreshadowed exactly nowhere and cared about by exactly noone). It's like they are missing 50 pages of text in this game. I have so many examples of the bad or straight up missing writing in this game, it's like the devs used most of the budget to go on pool parties or something.   So basically, combat sucks on any difficulty (with tactician + honor mode basically being ""ENEMIES HAVE 50% MORE HP"" sort of lazy, typical??????that you should never find in a carefully crafted RPG such as this one). The story is a sad, unfunny joke, with few redeeming characters that actually make you care about them (only Lohse and Red Prince to my knowledge have proper endings to their stories, both being decently written. Beast's story can actually proceed without him being alive and end the exact same way it does if he was.) There are far, FAR too many characters that are interesting at first glance but, woops, look at that, some pages went missing! Too much effort to find those it seems! From Lucian himself to basically an entire camp of EXP fodder characters with barely any story related to them or ways to finish quests related to them without just straight up KILLING them. But oh, this game was definitely carefully crafted and wonderful, especially the part where I could teleport NPC's while talking to them with one character and make most fights an even bigger joke than they were initially. And finally, gear in this game is the most pathetic attempt at skipping work I have seen. They basically just put RNG loot everywhere and didn't give two flying ????s about making more custom weapons or armor that are actually worth getting BECAUSE OF THE RNG LOOT EVERYWHERE. I also love it when talents become useless past the point where they clearly stopped trying, which is basically act 2, because they just couldn't be asked to  write anymore quests that are worth a damn (R.I.P Pet Pal). And let's not forget the always useful and prefered talents such as ambidextrous, which is great for when you want to do a grenade only playthrough with a one handed weapon only! Oh wait, that sounds tedious and stupid? Well, sucks for you, most talents ARE tedious and stupid, with no real usage over obviously better ones (Bigger and better). This game is only truly likeable by hardcore fans and people who tend to be bad at RPG's. Also those who like to delude themselves they didn't buy a crappy product that clearly has way less merit than people brandish it with.  TL:DR Combat sucks, story sucks with some small exceptions, class and talent balance sucks, difficulties suck, detailing on the world is poor gameplay wise and nothing you do has any impact on the ending and most, if not all of the game, including purging all of Rivellon for EXP GAINS is entirely viable and goes unpunished in any way. Voice acting is amazing though.  Final thoughts, do not buy this game if you like good story, a real, fair challenge or have played basically any other RPG with above toddler level difficulty enabled. Buy it if you have already managed to find the missing 100 pages of backstory and quest dialogue, as well have an idea how to patch the game into some form of balanced state where I can't oneshot the final boss in two turns on the hardest difficulty. Or, you know, if you just really like good voice acting."

Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game where you can customize your party's skills to a crazy degree and, in theory, play any way you want.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game where every character has a story to tell and where the game world feels truly alive.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game you can end up in a game-ending fight because you misclick on something and have to reload an autosave from 40+ minutes ago.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game that gives you very vague pointers to a quest that you can fail simply by picking an unmarked dialogue option or by not speaking to some unmarked person in an unmarked location whose name is some unrecognizable fantasy mumbo-jumbo listed in a horribly unhelpful journal system.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game where you can tab out, grab a glass of water, then tab back in and the eight enemies with twice your stats you're fighting so you can progress in the story still won't be done TPK-ing you.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game to give you five different dialouge options and have the outcome be the same no matter which one you pick, even if you simply attempt to walk into the room and blow the person you're talking to up.  Of course, it's pretty obvious I'm just bad at the game, but ???? me for wanting a game I can play on normal without cheesing it, right? I've put hundreds of hours into isometric rpgs (NWN, Tyranny, Baldur's Gate) and I've never encountered one so paradoxically annoying as this one.   The ""story mode"" makes the game a joke, yet the classic mode requires more build metamancing and AI exploitation than actual tactics to beat. The game gives you horribly vague breadcrumbs that you're supposed to follow for quests in a pointerless open world, yet sometimes railroads you into doing things while making you think you have a choice. It's absurd. It's simply not fun for me.  Clearly it's a subjective and unpopular opinion, but I don't reccomend this."

Don't care for lore rich games just want to play the game.   So slow I lost interest before the game even started. If you could somehow speed  the game up a bit it might be worth playing again.

While I have to admit the scale of DOS2 is absolutely amazing, I've never played a game that is so difficult to get started with.  The difficulty is punishing even if you follow advice from the internet and fellow players.  I'm definitely one for a challenge but it get tiresome getting your butt kicked everytime you into an enemy.  It's as if you can never take a deep breath and relax because around the corner is just yet another group of enemies that turn you into mince meat before you get to your second turn started.  I'm a life-long, old school player of RPGs going back to the old Might and Magic and Ultima days and I've ever encourntered a game like this that so well done yet so frustrating.  I'd love to recommend it but I simply can't.  Perhaps in a few months I'll return to it since I'm a glutton for punishment and never like to let a game get the better of me.  But be warned - this game is a heavy lift getting started so bear that in mind before you buy."
143,Pool,205,16,1,2017-12-27,Not Recommended,22.8,"Divinity Original Sin 2.  TL;DR: 6/10. Get it on sale.  The bad:  Writing: The writing for this game is muteable at best. It and NWN 1 share the 'main campaign is????? syndrome. I do not like any of the NPCs, any of the quests or any of the plots. It lacks feeling, everything is so gray and cliche.  Barrel mechanics: The game is oversaturated in environmental hazards, most notably barrels. I feel these are to the game's detriment and I am loathed to see them no matter where they are.  Game mechanics: They're not very satisfying. It's over-saturated in magic, conditions and punishes you for being tried-and-true melee as opposed to being any sort of spellcaster or ranged combatant. Even the monsters are throwing magic. Quit that. There's also physical and magical armor, that halves damage and... huh? It's more convoluted than any of the DND rulesets prior to 5E, as someone who's played them religiously for a decade.  Lack of direction: The game sort of just... plops you in and expects you to find your way. The NPCs you do talk to basically mumble about nothing worthwhile before dropping bread crumbs of a quest in their mumble and expecting you to unravel it. Your friend? Where? Who? What? Where do I find them? Who are they? What were they doing that got them captured? Elaborate. Give me something to go on. But lets say for the sake of it that you decide to play along and actually adventure around trying to find what they're talking about. I personally could not care any less about the actual adventuring aspect, because the terrain is the same old ugly terrain that puts me to sleep to just look at it. It suffers from 'everything is samey and bland' syndrome, like Path of Exile.  Camera angles: Ungodly awful. To swivel and look around with it is a headache. Two different buttons just to pan your camera? Neverwinter Nights one called, they said they want to loan you the driving camera.  Bugs: There's so many bugs. NPCs will randomly turn hostile (even if you did nothing to upset them, no thievery, no nothing). Sometimes in the arena beneath Fort Joy, you'll beat all of the combatants. If you're playing with friends, you'll have to fight each other for dominance. Even if you win (or lose), sometimes you'll just be stuck roaming around the map because it won't pull you out, and you'll have to reload. The bugs steadily become worse and worse by act 4.  Poorly planned Multiplayer: The ability to play with three other people is a nice gesture, BUT, to play with them, you'll have to start with them at the very beginning. You can't introduce a character mid-game and have them scale up or down to the main character's level. Otherwise, you'll have to play some limp gimp premade NPC who the main player probably uses as nothing more than a loot mule and a bullet sponge.  ---- The 'meh'  UI: It's serviceable. It's not great, often times the chat box will get stuck where you're trying to click. Sometimes, when you're trying to control an NPC, it won't completely register what you wanted to do, and instead your character who's at the top of this post will instead abandon his post to chase a barrel.  The soundtrack: Generic Latin-lite choirs. It is so bland it is incapable of being offensive to the ear. It is unspired and to be truthful, I did not care for it.  Art Design: The game is bland and grey on the art design as well. Nothing jumps out and impresses. The cutscenes in which drawn characters do battle or things of that sort look far better, but the game itself is just... meh. It's clear that the armor was intended to be little more than just shapes to tell who was who when zoomed out at full capacity. ---- The good:   Initiative track: The game has a functioning initiative list, where you can join battles mid engagement, as well as ensure everyone has a fair turn. NWN had one of these but didn't truly work.  Moddable: Like Neverwinter Nights, you can mod the game to high hell and back, changing a lot of the problem I had with the game.  Custom modules: You can completely ignore the primary campaign and play different modules. There is also a DM feature, in which the DM can control NPCs, create pieces on the dot, make them talk and onwards. Much, again (if you haven't seen a running theme in comparison) like Neverwinter Nights and to the game's favor.  -----  Final verdict: The game is serviceable as an RPG, but not very fun to play. I believe the future of this game does not rest in the production of the company, but rather in the hands of the community."

I love the combat style, the humor, the dialogues, but sadly the game has become completely unplayable due to the worst optimalisation I've seen in years.  Even on a relatively new PC it?s completely unplayable after Act 1 due to long loading times and stuttering. It?s a common problem which hasn?t been patched as yet. The game demands an unreasonable amount of processing power. My PC has a i5 processor and a GTX 1060 graphics card, which should be well within minimum requirements, yet it's still a massive slideshow even at the lowest graphics settings.  It?s a real shame, because I really enjoyed the game at the start. Act 1 was great to play, with a lot of winks and nudges towards the other games in the series. But as soon as I got off the boat in Act 2 the game became completely unplayable, taking up to 5 minutes to load a savegame and half a minute to pick up a single item. Updated my graphics drivers, got rid of old savegames, set all graphics settings to very low, but nothing helped to ease the demands on my CPU.  I had to abandon the game after really enjoying the first part :(  Don't leave your fans hanging, Larian Studios, please patch this game!"

Unfortunatley fights are plagued by the lack of testing, recent arbitrary nerfs and the non linearity (usually a good thing as long as you put some mechanics to prevent problems) of the maps.  I.E. its common to end in impossible fights you are supposed to face with more characters OR with quest items OR again at higher levels... and you can t figure out if they are supposed to be so.. because in the beginning you are too weak for almost any fight.  Second Same arbitrary nerfs not properly tested and some bugs ends up screwing story that instead would be nice.  Also you can end in dialogues that consider you talked to people you never talked to because story is somehow linear but areas are open thus they expect to follow an order that is not even clear and ignore if you do or not.  Some awful bugs for example are: 1) source nerfs (see flaming pigs quest) 2) teleport pyramids and much more.  In the end you can change settings to easy and change from total frustration of some fights to boringly easy the difference is huge between normal and easy.  Tag system is a really good idea its a pity this game seems unfinished and unpolished..... and trying to be difficult in the wrong way....with opponents being in most case teleporting fighters/wizards that shoot aoes from distance starting from better position.....

Whats the point of progression if you are always just as strong as everyone else...?

Seems dodgy as hell because the game is bloody terrible :(  I really have to be missing something here, like some others who left negative reviews also and couldn't figure out why so many others are giving it such positive reviews.  Also, for anyone with the Nvidia Shield TV box and streaming the game to it for 2 player local co-op splitscreen, it works but it doesn't work very well. First player (main controller) controls the screen movement and the splitscreen itself is very cumbersome and flaky (when it actually works) - could do with some serious improvements. It's a good feature though but it falls apart because the game is an RPG, like an old Amiga game with multiple text options in old 1980's style and it just plays awful for the purpose of local co-op splitscreen.

55,frederickhxu,101,62,9,2017-12-31,Not Recommended,81.9,"This is a heartbreaking negative review, but it is one that must be said. This game does not respect your time, or your agency as a player. The ending completely butchers the experience. Every choice you've made, every decision you went through, all the lives you save/lost, have no meaning in the game world in the end.  You have two choices in the end. One results in the world not changing at all, the other results in the world falling into chaos. Either way, you as a player have no control over any of it, and that's a damn shame.   Now, that being said, the glowing reviews do get 1 thing right: the first half of the game is quite uniquely done and is excellent. Acts 1 and 2 are excellent, I don't need to go into any real detail as all the glowing praise the game is receiving centers around those first two sequences.  Act 3 is generic, sluggish, and the combat is unfairly balanced towards the player (ironically). It's intended to be a filler act, but that's understandable. You get some nice lore revelations here, at least that saves this act.  Act 4 is horrible. It took what Act 3 did badly, and dragged it out. 20 hours of puzzles, hidden switches, locked doors, all for what? For predictable plot points. Things revealed in Act 2 and 3 and quest progression all play out exactly how you expect them to. A tedious and boring slog through an unfinished and rushed map. As for the combat, their effort to make it challenging results in cheap tactics. Bosses will always go first, and have large amounts of action points to spam spells endlessly and kill your party outright, and all throughout the act you will need to result in strange gimmicks to conclude fights.  One very positive thing though: The companion system and the character building is insanely well-done. If you are to buy this game, buy it for those companion quests. Very well done quests indeed. This is where the replay value lies, to experience the quests of the allies that you didn't get to adventure with the first time through.  As for the ending, I can't reiterate it enough. The game simply does not deliver. All the creative world building and world impact that you can make in Acts 1 and 2 are erased, and replaced with a generic blanket ending that will ultimately overshadow the adventure and leave you feeling dissatisfied. Even your companions are generically written in the ending.  What a damn shame. This is a game that was released unfinished. I suggest keeping this title in the back of your mind, and when they do release an Enhanced Edition that rectifies the problems that arose from (likely) rushed development, I will wholeheartedly recommend it.

My mind was completely blown every step of the way through this fantastic journey, start to finish.   Positives+ You do ?????? need to play its predecessor to understand what's going on in this title. + That voice acting. Every line. Every banter. Even the narration when nothing needs to be said between characters. It's fantastic. + A beautifully detailed, living world. You can see how much love and work when into this. So much to explore, so much to see. So many little secrets tucked away here and there. Not to mention while in combat, every single turn needs to be thought out depending on the enviroment around you.  + The assortment of items, weapons and armor is definitely not lacking.  + The ability to freely make your own ""class"" for yourself and your companions. Mix and match whatever skills you want. Whatever suits your playstyle. If you want a Skeleton guy to be your main healer with Necromancy, then do it! + I finished the game on the easiest difficulty in about 85-90 hours, give or take. And that's without finishing all the side quests or companion quests. The amount of content stuffed into this game will leave you plenty to do. + Co-op. Yes. You can play the entire game start to finish with a friend, with a few friends, with strangers. It doesn't matter.  + Dungeon Master mode. Does creating entire campaigns like Dungeons and Dragons appeal to you? Then heck yes! I never really took much time to dabble in it, but I can see the appeal to it. + Replayability. This is huge for me. So many choices that will leave you wondering ""what if I had done this differently?""   Negatives- It's been a fair bit since I played, but I had an issue finishing a companion quest that was tied into the same NPC as another companion I had. Once completed, one companion was stuck and could not progress. I ended up finishing the game without completing it. - A few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking. Most notably in ""The Arx"". There was one house with locked doors in which you could run right through them. - I noticed here and there a fair bit of an FPS drop in combat when my screen is exploding with spell effects.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is unforgiving, doesn't coddle and definitely doesn't hold your hand, but taking the time to learn the combat system and all the little bits and pieces is worth every penny from your wallet and every second of your time."

Real Thoughts on stand out issues - After playing some more, the game is beyond linear to my PoV. The story starts and is oddly dull but the combat is somewhat cool, never have been a fan of turn based games but this one has at least some features that make it stand out. I understand this is a die hard D&D Game but everything feels like you've either done all the events correctly in this one specific order or you've been punished. The first area not being the ship but the island is a major turn off. Nothing was really impressive, your choices of things to say to everyone seemed limited and always ended up making everyone attack you if you didn't choose the correct script. That is easily the biggest issue IMO about this game. For people who are very story driven and love punishment for trying to do your own thing, this is your game. Movement is awful trying to click and move you always steal something from someone and the town again hates you, selection is buggy and has a mind of it's own, smaller things but they grow on you quickly. Trying to quest without looking everything up is also a problem. I spend more time reading the wiki page because the quest journal is lengthy like this stupid review im writing. These are some of the things that really stand out and make this a no go for me. The current price tag is also just a bit much."

Although I backed the game on Kickstarter (just like the first) and had an Early Access copy, I didnt play it until full launch so that I could fully immerse myself. And immerse myself I did into this high-fantasy adventure that manages to make the magical and fantastical feel realistic and gritty. It has taken everything that was good about Divinity: Original Sin and improved upon it, whilst also making it so you dont need to have played the first in any way as it takes place a thousand years before.  Whether Im following a quest that portrays me as the savior of the universe (hero complex much?) or trying to solve the angst of a tiny rat I really believe in my characters and their responses. There is a balance between the epic and the banal, the frivolous and the fateful that creates a woven world that is wonderful to experience.  In my first playthrough, co-op with a friend, Im a summoner, focusing on gathering my minions. Im a bit heavy handed though, Ill send my minions into battle at a moments notice from afar, but stand aside, watching the ebb and flow, supporting and commanding the field. I speak harsh truths and it frequently gets me into trouble even though I feel righteous. In my solo playthrough, Im a morally ambiguous pickpocketing hitman with a deep, dark past that Ive blocked from memory. I fight with my words, and flirt with absolutely everyone, often getting what I desire in alternative ways.

It's not a bad game per se, it's just the flaws in its design just become so irritating by the end of the campaign that I found myself just going through the motions and hate-playing it simply to finish the damn thing.  I feel like if you stripped out the campaign and left the assets and the DM mode and just sold it at a much reduced price it would really nail it as a multiplayer CRPG.  The irritations that got worse as I played was the lack of actual freedom in the game. Both in terms of dialogue options having no appreciable difference and the way that quests are intended to be done in a specific order. For example, if you are just free wandering through the map and come across a hostile NPC that is 2 or more levels higher than you, just reload your quicksave and make a note not to go there until you're 1 level higher than it. In each chapter there's about a 3 level spread that you need to deal with, and quests should be knocked off from easiest to hardest if you're not comfortable cheesing the heck out of the AI.  Each level represents a huge step up in damage output, resistance and general ability. I feel this is the weakest part of a game that supposedly prides itself on player agency. If you got rid of levelling altogether and made combat all about efficient and clever use of skills/equipment then the combat would be amazing.  Another annoyance that only gets worse is the journal. It's so vauge as to what you should be doing next, who to see, what level each quest is, and even if a quest can be completed in the current chapter you're in are completely omitted. Most of the time I ended up having to look through the wiki to solve a lot of quests. Half of which weren't even in the current chapter!  The voice acting is good, the writing ranges from passable to good. The plot is extremely generic. The graphics are pretty enough. The bugs are plentiful and even with heavy patching I just don't see this game getting to a point where I can recommend it.

152,Rear Fanged Venomous,29,20,2,2018-01-13,Not Recommended,81.8,"While the game is very entertaining for some time, parts of the integral mechanics become unbearable over time. The AI of the enemy is insufferable, as they will merely walk around and drag fights out for seemingly no reason. While on this topic, the fights, while extremely interactive and unique, granted, take a very long time to complete. The ability to skip or speed up turns would go a long way to making the gameplay flow better. When completing questions, waypoints will appear and never leave; even when you beat the quest they will remain.  On the story side, I am torn. The lore in the game is incredibly in-depth with a plethora of supernatural powerhouses and somewhat unique powers, but the story itself is brutally bad. Do NOT read further unless you are OK with spoilers. While the first half of the story is very engaging and interesting, it completely falls apart half way through. Everyone who was bad turns good (except one), everyone who is good turns bad, the decisions you make don't matter. Anyone who you choose to kill will come back (if only to die again literally two minutes later) and there is nothing you can do to prevent this, despite the game tricking you into thinking your choices matter. The primary antagonist uses a weapon that is never mentioned once to beat you in one of the hardest ""this only happened because plot"" moments I have seen in fiction. For the final decision, the choice does impact the world, but at that point you don't get to see the effects outside of a minute long epilogue.   On the whole, the gameplay is generally good but has very irritating issues, such as bad NPC AI and permanent waypoints. The story, despite having an incredible potential and great worldbuilding, falls flat on its face harder than I have ever seen a story do.  TLDR: If you are in exclusively for the gameplay and are OK with long fights, questionable AI, and permenant waypoints, you will love it. If you are in it for the story or any of the aforementioned problems seem unbearable, skip this game."

While Original Sin was already a good RPG game and had plenty to offer, I was a bit skeptical that whether or  not Larian Studios could top that. But boy did they. Original Sin 2 is better than the first in every way. Its safe to say that Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best, if not the best RPG of year,especially for us old school pen & paper rpg lovers.  While RPG's are all about choices & consequences & development of your character,you don't find many PC RPG's that offer this kind of choices,where your decisions and actions are so impactful. Meaning, You can kill an NPC related to the main quest,try to steal from a vendor & loose access to their inventory,build your dream character or a good for nothing crew,the choices are limitless . There is always another way to take care of your duties if you fail in one. In other worlds, Larian was able to  PUT THE R BACK IN RPG in this game.  Another really strong aspect of Divinity Original Sin 2 is its characters,especially the SIX Origin Characters to choose from who have rich backstories and amazing voice-acting to boot. Similar to Dragon Age Origins,the Origins lets you play as unique characters with their own agendas & goals. And if you want to create a custom character,then fret not,you can have them as companions in your journey. One piece of advice though. There's a nasty piece of surprise waiting for you at the end of ACT 1. So choose & build your companions carefully.  As far as gameplay is concerned, theres nothing new or innovative in terms of gameplay, but rather, a refined version of what weve already had for years"

Re-rolled and this time made it to the second act. I learned how to ""bless"" surfaces, and was anxious to try it out in combat. That proved to be completely pointless, everything became a sea of necrofire anyway.  Equally pointless to bother doing anything but physical damage + max warfare as well, given the dual armor system. And there are loads of other niggles that I can't be bothered with, just like I can't be bothered to finish this thing. My wife stuck it out on her own campaign and had nothing but increasingly horrible things to say about everything after the second act.  Obviously plenty of people like it, and you might too.

The combat and all questing is never boring.  The game has been a real sense of accomplishment playing through it, it's so much fun to play with friends, so I'd really recommend this as a co-op game. However, playing solo is also very fun. All other games since I bought D:OS 2 have been outclassed by it in sense of enjoyment for me.  Not a short game either with all the mod capabilities, and I've played about halfway through the story in about 122 hours and I've still so much more to explore in the game.

797,Nurse,648,3,0,2018-01-15,Recommended,125,"My personal Review to Divinity: Original Sin 2 So, lets get this straight, this game is a master-piece.   It's a game like XCOM: Enemy Unkown its a game like The Witcher its a game like Dragon Age and many more...  Divinity is not for everyone, but it is for everyone who loves MMO/RPG/TBG Turn based game I try to be spoiler free, but i will include stuff in this review that is obvious.  Character Editor There are a few thing's that i want to talk about, mostly good. You can create your own char in this game, and it's not only for the look, it changes the gameplay for the entire game. There are a few races, Human's, Lizard's, Drawf's, Skeleton's, Elf's... Every Race has a unique talent, example: Elf's can eat body Part's and know what happened to them or what they thought about while they died, sound strange? Yes it is. But it help's you in-game to find hidden treasures or hidden quest's. Even the NPC's are reacting to your Gender/Race/Behavior.  You can choose your own Style, i dont mean hair, face, etc. i mean... how your char is reacting to things... example: I mad a Noble Lizard, that talk's like it has a stick up her?????? I role-play her like she is a Annoying know-it-all.  This way, your story takes different out comes. So watch out what you pick.  The only thing that bugs me is, that i cant change how tall my char is, how the body looks... Also, some gear looks weird on the body of the chars, they look more fat in some of these, and some are way to skimpy.  There are also many trait's and Skills you can pick but thats too much to go in to... You just need to know one think... there is everything from the normal knight to cleric.  This might be a spoiler for an enemy in the game: Some races has permanent side effects.. like skeletons heal when they get poison damage, same with enemys Martin Looter King What can i say? There is a??????tone of loot... i dont know how much and how different they are, but what i saw so far... simply -amazing-  I just noticed, here and there, some clothing and loot looks the same... different item stats, but what will you do with a such big game?  The Trading is very simple to use, easy to access, quick to understand.   Enemy's you face NPC's Sadly, this is the only point i am slighty disappointed, its not bad for me, but i think some people might notice very quickly, that there are not that many different enemy types. Yes there are plenty, but for the length of this game, it might get boring. I dont mean the fights, i mean the types, i go to the fights after this section...  Oh boy... the NPC's... Where do i start? Simply put, they all are very good written, +1 to the writer's. They never get boring, it feels like every NPC has a story... also, they all are voiced, but sometimes here and there, they dont speak, mostly for stuff like ""YOU THERE! You violated the law! Return your goods or serve your sentence!""  But still, its amazing how much time they put in to the voice acting... and the Narrator... gosh, very good job... you mostly hear his voice, he is describing EVERYTHING you see, smell, feel, do. Its truly amazing.  Sometimes you hear the same voice actor from another person... but this is not a biggy. They did the same in Oblivion, but i dont mind, some people do but not me, a simple little thing.   Multiplayer / Co-op / D&D Mode Alright, lets make this one short, There  is the PvP in alpha/beta, quite fun, then you are able to play the WHOLE Story with 3 others... other player. It's super fun, but i recommend to play with someone you know or to scream at... if you play with randoms... they attack the guard... many... times... its a pain in the?????? Sometimes people dont do that, but many do...  So now to the D&D section, Thats one of the best features the game can offer right next to the single-player. I recommend not to access the Game Master Mode, many spoilers there, enemy types, loot etc.  It's hard to describe, but all you need to know, its like a level editor, or like that one thing from Arma 3 Zeus mode. You can role Dice, you can possess NPC's you can do all kind of?????? But... you need to do all by your self. That means, no NPC's walking around, only you, moving people from A to b. Would be cool if they would add something like a Waypoint/patrol mode so people are walking around citys, taverns etc.   Battles, Fight's, What can you do SO, the main thing in divinity: Original Sin 2 is the battles, fights, etc.  I tried something harder then easy mode - died. You need some training in the beginning but you will find a way to deal with different enemy types and 'areas'.  By Area, i mean... You surrounding. There are some different types of 'things' laying around... Let's talk about the basic of the basic, Fire we all know it, we all hate it. You can ignite Oil with fire, you can throw oil at enemy's, you can burn an enemy and lead him in to a puddle of oil so they explode in a cool way. There are some other thinks like Water and wetness, combined with electricity... just try stuff... its super fun to combine these elements... you can also use magic to make it cursed ;)  My RatingAre there Physic's / Ragdoll in the game? - Yas How big is the map?                                   - Very big, much to explore How are the graphic's?                               - Very nice, smooth pleasent to watch people burn or acid away Fighting?                                                     - Very good, sometimes its too easy, sometimes its too hard, or just ged gud. Multiplayer?                                                - Everything works good, no disconnect stuff or lagging.

A lot... you are not getting bored in this game... Replay potential?                                       - I think you could play this game like 30 times and you still wouldnt find everything in                                                this game, many secrets, many options, combine race/trait's and you will have a different out come Is it buy worthy? Yes! 100% but ONLY when you are a fan of TBG/MMO/RPG's video games. A few games as example:  XCOM: Enemy unknown Dragon Age The Witcher Mass EffectThere are just a hand full of good MMORPG's out there, and if you like turn based combat, then its the perfect game for you, you can waste so many hours in this game, finding the best way to solve problems without fighting. You coudl play this game for a long time just to find out what else is hidden in this game. Gather some friends, play D&D online master the dungeons together. When you search a game with 100% on Metacritics or 10/10 IGN- Would Burn again then... you found it. It cost a lot of money, but its worth it. I think this game was on Kickstarter once too, but just look at it... so much time and effort. If there is a game that's worth the money, it's this one."

778,seanhogge,93,3,0,2018-01-19,Recommended,97.6,"So you already know the game is good. Very positive reviews overall and recently. The devs are responsive and sensitive to the players, and it's one of the few Kickstarter projects that didn't seem to fall apart or leave everyone underwhelmed.  What I'd like to do is help you figure out what will leave you perfectly whelmed with this game.  TL;DR? It's tough to get into. I failed the first time. Experiment and mod, and you'll have a blast. The game won't keep you from fights way too tough for you. Just learn caution.  I started it maybe 18 months ago, got to the first town and quit in sort-of frustration. I had approached it all wrong. Maybe I can help others avoid the mistake. Here's what you'll need to know, I think.  This is a game of thought. The action is visceral and fun and frequent (unless you prefer it not to be), but even then you'll be most successful when you are deliberate and creative. Don't expect Dragon Age, this is more complex. Battles aren't about the amount of damage, they're about doing the right damage at the right time. You can see the action order, you can see weaknesses, you can chain things together.  The game is a challenge. Levels are significant. 4 level 10s vs 3 level 11s can be a genuinely tough fight when you're still learning mechanics and combos. Quicksave a lot. Just. Like, constantly. Trust me. It's exhilarating that any encounter can go either way, but you can easily get caught with your skivvies in the static cloud.  Don't be afraid to mod, even on your first play through. I came back after a few mods eased some annoyances and made the game slightly easier, but still a challenge. Just do whatever you need to experience the game, and don't listen to the magisters purists. The strength here is in the play, not the mechanical experience.  You can completely respec at any time, starting in Act 2. No mods needed, total freedom to move all your points. The only thing downside is that you'll have to spend money on skills if you go in a new direction. But even in Act 1, don't fret about getting every level-up right. Try wacky things.  Crafting isn't a chore. Once you know a recipe, you can just make it if you have the stuff. You can experiment like a graveyard debtor without penalty. You can ignore crafting altogether.  Leveling up, getting new equipment, and getting new skills all make an impact. All of them happen often enough that I feel like I'm more powerful in almost every fight. A single level opens up many new options. A new weapon is usually around the corner. A new skill is about to be revealed. Relish it, rookie.  Choices make a difference, not in a superficial way. But there's always a way around. Almost. If there isn't, then that's why you and I will have to play through again. I'm only in Act 2, but I already have a half-dozen things I'd like to see go a different way.  You can make mistakes. I killed a guy I needed because he got????????that I kept asking the same question. So then I had to work around it. It was great. The devs have you, you can't get yourself into an unbeatable state, but ain't no one gonna slay the voidwoken in the closet for you. Also, if you have an undead, always check their coverings or disguise. Just sayin'. Poor townspersons.  Do you like ""gaming the game?"" Figuring out what's overpowered and exploiting it? Go for it! Me, I think that's as boring as a turtle's unrequited love laments, so if you're like me don't read a thing about min-maxing or party makeup. Just pick what you like and you can make it work and the work to do so won't be so bad because it's fun.  If you expect Diablo or Dragon Age, a one-best-way game or mindless distraction, this isn't it. I dig all of those, but this game isn't what I play to scratch those itches.  Oh, and teleport is a crazy useful skill. Make sure at least 1 person has it. FIN."

Edit: Picked it up again because I was bored and wanted a good RPG. I have 130 hours in this game, got near the end of the game, and, for some reason, only then realized that everything past the first map of the game, Fort Joy, was a waste of time. My main gripes would be:  -The initiation mechanic which killed any sense of balance within the already mediocre combat system -Zero roleplayability  -Story is poorly explained and executed. I tried caring about the plot early on, I really did, but it was just such a trainwreck of unexplained fanfic.net material that I stopped caring about quarter way through the game  -Massive railroading -A complete lack of space to roam around and do as you please, see above -The camera angles are worked in a way which made me constantly turn my neck to try and get a better look at what was happening. Never experienced this from any other videogame. -The suddenness of the lewd scenes compared to just how little romance actually takes place before them. Felt awkward and abrupt, but this could be due to the lack of interaction between party characters, which leads me to: -Lack of likeable characters. This is pretty big in a role-playing game, where gameplay is usually supposed to take a hit in order to allow more resources to be put onto branching paths of the story, characters, making everything else an enjoyable experience, etc. I only liked one of the six characters and later grew to like two others, but even then they had so few lines and barely reacted to the story that I felt like they weren't really there.  -Enemies often get massive advantages, both in numbers and quality, and near-always get to have their strongest character move first combat regardless if you attacked them first out of combat or not -Still fraught with glitches despite being out for several years now, had to keep restarting the game due to my turns being skipped.  -Has the worst quest journal in any game I've seen: ignore it completely and use Google -Large difficulty spikes are common  A few good things about the game though: +Tig o' dwarf bitties +You get a randumb squirrel riding a cat companion that sometimes gives you stuff +The plot actually got me really excited one time for about three hours +There's a lot of content if you're willing to put up with all the negatives. +You can be a skeleton  +You can bang elves +You can genocide elves  +Lizard babes +You can genocide elves  3/10 would not recommend, if you really want it then get some friend to buy it for you during steam sales for a quarter or something, idk, go read a book or something"

433,LMW-YBC,137,4,1,2018-01-20,Recommended,126.8,"I bought this game knowing nothing about the franchise or of its background. My friends wanted to play it as it had co-op and looked pretty nice from the screenshots we had, so we all picked it up and gave it a go. 50 hours later, we eventually managed to finish our first playthrough, and what I came out with is one of the most enjoyable game experiences I have ever had, and without a shadow of a doubt my game of the year for 2017.  First of all, I did not expect the writing or voice-acting to be as good as it is. There is a lot of genuinely captivating moments the game has and a good amount of decisions you can make, either as an individual or as a party. You really do feel like you are on this grand adventure, and you essentially make your own story (even if you play as one of the origin characters) which is awesome.  Now, I think I need to get onto what is the most amazing part of this game: the gameplay. On the surface it seems quite simple, and it isn't exactly difficult as you have plenty of time to make decisions and your abilities clearly show what you can and cannot do in your current position. But if you take the time to experiment with things, you can discover new things that can entirely change the way you battle. Elements can combine to create strong new effects, objects and characters can be blessed to create entirely different effects based on their surroundings, combining abilities can create fantastic (and sometimes even hilarious) opportunities for your party, and so on. You are actively encouraged to try out new things, which is something I rarely see games do now.  The diversity of abilities is also a huge plus. There are a bunch of skill paths you can choose from, each having their own unique abilities. You can focus on having a bit of everything, or you can focus on a couple of paths, but whatever you do you will be able to make it work as with many paths you have a lot of capabilities to control the battle, and with less paths your abilities will be much stronger and capable of dealing a lot of damage. Finding a mix-and-match of what works for your team best is part of the fun, you can even change your stats entirely at a certain point so you can change if you feel your current ones aren't working.  I think it's no surprise, but the game is damn pretty. Even for a top-down game the level of detail in the world is astounding, and the art style really appeals to me. It never stays the same either, as you explore you will find new areas that have an entirely different look and feel to the last place, usually accomodated by new enemy types as well. I love the different races and how they look, as well as how differently they are represented in the game's society. It's an exceptionally well-made fantasy world that still manages to be believable.  Such a great game, if you are even remotely into RPGs I would say give this one a go. It's best played with friends for sure, although playing solo is fine, too."

1658,SuicideKing,107,2,0,2018-01-22,Recommended,177.9,"At the risk of heaping too much praise on the game despite not even having left the initial Fort Joy area, it's bloody marvellous.  There are so many paths to take in the story and each NPC interaction feels unique. I'm playing 2 mutliplayer games in parallel, with different characters, and it's played out differently in both cases because of different starting variables and events, along with different player actions. It's really great. BTW, it's not like we haven't escaped Fort Joy because we don't know how to - oh no, we could have escaped at multiple moment, but we chose to stay. Partly to XP farm, partly because there's just so much to do!  Moreover, it addresses the issue i usually have with games that have level systems and loot - the weapons scale with your attributes, and higher level gear can be equipped if you have the appropriate attributes. So for example, if you're playing a melee build and have the appropriate Strength, you can equip level 4 armour while being level 3.  Combat is pretty fun if you're into turn-based stuff. Think ""new XCOM but with Action Points"", but perhaps more chaotic and varied. Spread some oil, set it ablaze. Then chuck poison in it to watch it go boom! Or the other way around.There are pre-defined classes but you can tweak them as you like, and respec any time. I haven't even got to the point where I can use Source abilities yet.  Crafting seems pretty complex, but it's really cool. Find a stick, some rope and a knife - you now have a knife-on-a-stick and can use it as a sword. Find a stick and a large sea shell, you now have a magic staff. Have a potion flask and a poison barrel? Well, now you have a poison flask. Why'd you need a poison flask? Because Undead heal with poison (and get damaged by health/vitality potions).  Anyway, it's an exceptionally well made game. Runs pretty smooth for me at pretty high settings (can't remember, i think it just set itself to ultra, and i didn't have to tamper with the settings) @ 1080p with a i5-3570K, GTX 670 and 8GB of RAM. Haven't encountered any bugs yet. Let that sink in. A game bought 3 months after release, in 2017, has not had a single bug so far, in 20 hours of play.  Highly recommended, obviously! :D  edit: The music is great too!"

But I do not like being forced into doing most if not all side quests just to be able to progress. In some of the Witcher games, and Fallout I have done a majority of the side quests, but that is because I choose to, not because I have to. In this game if I do not do the side quests, I can simply not progress through the main content due to being too low level. Seems every step of the main story progressions saw me having to go back and complete side quests so I had a chance of being able to progress.  If you are someone that loves doing all the side quests, then this game may well be a game you will enjoy, but if you are someone that likes just pushing through the main story line, I can not recommend this game."

I know this is more common these days, but it's still not cool. * The quests are seemingly deliberately confusing and opaque, like riddles.  * For a game supposedly built around pen and paper freedom, you seem to need to do all side quests to have enough XP/levels to go forward in the main story. * Buggy, had to reload after doing Examine on my incarnate and he couldn't do any actions after that"

The last 3 acts each get more focused on the main quest and side quests that branch from it. The huge time sink in the game is how many side quests you get or prevent from completing if you kill everyone.      The game does favor heavily playing the good side as after watching the ending you get 30 seconds if choosing anything other than the good option with no details on anything other than world is screwed. You choose to be good; you get over 10 minutes of details about every character you helped, companions, and the entire world in way more detail. I usually play the hero and help anyone I can and accidently picked the wrong option as it I thought it was the good choice.

I was amazed. open world. randomized goals for every player in the party which allows traitory to archieve it. I saw huge existing worlds. so much ways to trick the other players. there was no end to the possibilites... everything staged.  Now you have linear layers of maps. The same story. non of my friends and me were able to play it for a 2nd time because the replayvalue of the game is non existant. nearly no encounter matters. its always the same. your goal and way is the same (not like they showed in the past).  My first playthrough was amazing. All great thats left now is the amazing fight system.  Nothing is random generated. One playthrough and then never again.  It would be soooo awesome if there  would be an open game mode. throw in the great fightsystem. a nemesis system for different parties like the magisters or black ring. let them affect the world. then fight them, shape the world with a smart AI system that plays against you. random encounters guranteed. it adds some great survival and endless fighting encounters over time. getting strong. rewarding. and then imagine they realy put in their acted and staged randomized goals for each player in it which they showed in the past, what could have been.  But nope. their effort went into a borderline open world and linear questline.  I recommend to buy this game when its like under the 20 because its only worth one playthrough.

Larian did imrpove on Divivinity OS 1 and made this game much better. In retrospect D:OS 1 (even though i liked it) looks like a prototype/proof of concept in comparsion to this iteration.  The Good:  -Combat system is great. Especially the adition of Physical and Magical Armor. -Likeable Companions with their own story. -Better Graphics, Effects and animations (compared to D:OS1) -Overall better Combat system (but some small annoyances) -Loads Of content (Took me about 100 hours to finish the game) -Great Soundtrack -Improvements on unique playstyles (Playing undead etc)  The Bad: -The story. Even though betetr than the story of D:OS and even though it is passable it wasn't that interesting to me. Occasionally the side story fo the companion characters were much more interesting to me. -There are still bugs(e.g. Even though i choos e a different ending i got another one->won't go into detail so i won't spoil a thing) -Small annoyances in combat: Source Point system wasn't going really anywhere for me. Should have been refined.; Some enemies have annoying abilities: Cursed Wardens/Necrofire........ -At the last chapter some of the quests are knda tedious. Sometimes more is less.   Anyhow, all in all one of my most favourite RPGs of all time I think.  Let's hope Divinity 3 will be even better.  p.s.:If you liked the D:OS series you could always go back and try Divine Divinity (Diablo like 2d game) or Divinity 2 Director's Cut(Gothic/Risen kinda game with skills and dragon transformation.)

PROS: (Oh boi, where do I begin from) +Looks very good visually and boasts equally good music. +Deep character customisation and progression. +Complex, intricate systems that let you experiment and even break the game. This lends to a lot of player freedom and agency. +Staggering attention to detail. +Quests are plenty and missable. There are multiple approaches and outcomes to every quest. +Chaotic, tactical combat along with clever AI scripting +The amount of replayability is off the charts! This is one game which requires multiple runs to experience everything.  CONS:-Some UI issues, where I had to click on a combat skill multiple times for the game to register it. A minor nitpick.  VERDICT:Simply put, Divinity Original Sin 2 IS the best role-playing game that makes The Witcher 3 look like a generic open-world title. What you get is an impossibly interactive game world where every action seems possible, and has consequences with such a level of complexity and flexibility its difficult to believe it exists, let alone that it could ever be bettered.  Its scope can be intimidating, but not overwhelming, and theres usually a way to fix a mistake.  And its that intimidating, ambitious scope, that dedication to player freedom, that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so impressive.  There isnt another game right now that lets you do so much.   This is an easy 10/10. Buy it, play it and fall in love with RPG's all over again."

It is obvious that the developers of this game have put in their hearts to making a game that best suits the wants of a community of tired gamers who just wanted the freedom to make decisions, to customize their gameplay, and have a fully immersive story all along the way. Not only that, but this game will introduce you to new and interesting game mechanics that are both a pleasure to play with and against. When things go wrong in the game, you can't help but laugh it off because you are fully aware that your faults lay in your own mistakes or lack of understanding about certain core mechanics. However frustrated you may get at something or upset with yourself for having made some mistake, the game is interesting and engaging enough to motivate you to try again and learn from your mistakes. This game is definitely a must buy for any rpg lover.  If there is one thing I can hope to see in the future, it is official DLC. I would love to experience new classes, new abilities, new gear, and new stories.

345,Aben,69,4,2,2018-02-04,Not Recommended,486.2,"Balance is a bit off. As long as you have armor  you can not get CC'd. However, in the early game, armor is insufficient to make not getting CC'd a real option. If the fight has your party outnumbered, your health pool will not be sufficient to handle the focus fire that comes with the CC, and you will lose party members. Lose party members, and it is not likely that you can revive them successfully without repeating the cycle. It is possible to play with a solo talent that gives more actions and armor. This makes the game much more balanced early on if not too easy. In reflection, I feel that the experience to level is simply too steep and that if the levels would come quicker everything would be much more balanced. Around level 10-12 armor gets MUCH more powerful and the game seems like it balances back out before it gets easy end game.   The real issue I have with the game though is that in order to make your character powerful you MUST focus your attributes and skills sufficiently. If the attributes were slightly less dominant, then it might be possible to build a more broad character and enjoy the resulting flexibility. In the end, this was simply extremely difficult to do, and the balance issues noted caused me to stop playing. Too a long time messing with various character configurations before that point though."

153,Eyndra,70,24,2,2018-02-05,Not Recommended,88.9,"I have some really mixed emotions about this game.   I'll start with the good.   This game's platform is very good. In a party oriented strategic RPG I have never played a game with better mechanics.   This game's platform for modding is left very open ended and mod-friendly, and user created content can really enrich the experience.   There is a lot of nuance in character builds, and you can make your character a useful addition to a team, or play solo in many fulfilling ways.  The bad?   Unless you're playing with the max of 4 people in co-op, this game will keep you busy for no more than 40 hours.   The story isn't open-ended, there is no new game+, and you can't revisit the world after the game is over.   The story is hilariously convoluted and you'd have to have a flair for tin-foil-hat levels of curiosity and tedium to be able to enjoy that aspect.   There is no gratifying ending available to you in this game.   Most interesting character development is walled behind ""speech checks,"" where you're given the option to choose several dialogue options that will impact the character's development; which isn't a problem in particular, but the developers were a little overzealous, with some character arcs requiring the correct permutation of up to 40 of these ""multiple choice"" options, with some details being so minute no blame could be assigned for failing them.   The developers added a ridiculous amount of detail to this game without actually adding any ""meat and potatoes"" content that is rewarding for the player.   You are expected to explore every nook and cranny on every map to be able to appreciate the story, with the continuation of some story arcs locked behind some buried pouch in some obscure and completely insignificant location.   Without the aid of mods, the game is seriously absent of balance; mods are the lifeblood of this game's accessibility.  In summary, as a single person looking to buy this game to without the intention of co-op, it is seriously not worth full price. There are more options to explore in the multiplayer arena that may make the game more fun for small groups, but regarding what the developers have provided us with, the game is sorely lacking and you'll end up paying for more than you get."

276,irrelevant_elephant,94,3,1,2018-02-07,Not Recommended,160.5,"If wondering why I spent so much time and still gave a thumbs down it's because I enjoyed it at first, but during Act 2 things went downhill. I would have quit except I had invested 120 hours at that point and I was still interested in the story.     PROS  + Presentation  The graphics are high quality for an isometric RPG with settings such as DOF, god-rays, shadowing, and other effects. Environments are stuffed full of assets, giving your eyes plenty to take in. Armors are probably the best I have ever seen containing lots of details and some especially foreign fashions. The soundtrack is an unusual combination of typical orchestra mixed in with exotic instruments; the result is a unique listening experience. The dialogue is entirely voice-acted making for a welcome addition. I did, however, noticed some inconsistency in the recording. Occasionally while talking to someone, it would suddenly sound like the actor/actress was too far away from the mic which was a bit jarring to hear. For the most part, the voice acting is excellent. Overall DOS 2 has a unique style and feels like a triple 'A' experience.   + Story  The premise is intriguing enough: Rivillon is in danger of being invaded, and the only hope is for someone to become the new Divine. You have the potential to achieve divinity, but so do your companions, and only one of you can ascend to godhood. If you decide to play as a premade character, then you'll have your own background story to play through. The main plot has some surprises which entice you to go on, and near the end, there are some crazy plot twists.   CONS  - Inconsistent Difficulty  The difficulty in this game varies way too much. Estimating how hard enemies are before a battle is less predictable than you would think. Factors such as quantity of enemies, what skills they have, and terrain significantly influence the outcome. I've had battles where I should have lost due to being out-leveled and out-numbered and yet still come out alive. On the other hand, I had enemies I couldn't defeat despite being a higher level and outnumbering them.   - Fragmented Exploration and Questing   When it comes to exploring and doing quests, you'll often get interrupted by difficulty spikes forcing you to leave and return once you've leveled up. Now, this is fine in moderation; many other games do this enforcing a sense of progression. The problem with DOS 2 is this sort of thing occurs persistently. It's frustrating to frequently start a quest, progress some ways into it, and then put it on hold while you grind other quests. These other quests also require you to stop part ways in and come back to later. The result is that you are always bouncing back and forth chipping away at things so that you can progress a little further.   It's like watching a marathon of movies, but instead of doing so in sequence, you do it in a scattered manner. Eventually, you will finish watching everything, but because there are constant interruptions, it's hard to get engaged with any one movie. In your attempt to complete what you have already started, the game thrusts several more quests for you to chip away. At one point, I had about twenty in my log. Having lots of quests to do is good, just not all at once; it gets overwhelming. It's not possible to avoid this from happening either because to progress you need to explore thoroughly, but in doing so, you unintentionally trigger more quests thus overloading your log.   A way to streamline gameplay is to decrease the difficulty, but unfortunately, this makes specific encounters underwhelmingly easy. So you can either have a fragmented adventure or have a cake walk. This quandary is all thanks to the wild variation in difficulty which I mentioned earlier.   Another thing which bothers me is the inability to go back to previous acts. I had a dilemma where I was getting tired of the Driftwood map and wanted to move on but still had unfinished quests. If the devs had allowed a return to areas, then I would have carried on with the game and come back after feeling more refreshed. Instead, I had to make an unnecessary choice between forcing myself to finish those quests there and then, or move on but forever lose the opportunity to do them.  - Flawed Combat  Initially, I enjoyed combat despite its short-comings, but as time went on, certain flaws grew more irritating. Combat lacks what I consider to be bare-bone essentials of turn-based gameplay. For starters, there is no cover mechanic which means melee characters will be out in the open exposed to ranged attacks. Also, you can't set overwatch (attack of opportunity) by yourself; it's automatic. Characters don't even get it by default; you have to earn the talent for it.   Another thing that hurts combat is the initiation system. In games like XCOM, turns get divided by teams. During your party's turn, you can use members in any order you'd like. You can also partially use a character's action points and then after issuing commands for other members, come back to use up the rest. Part of the fun and strategy of this setup is deciding what sequence of actions is optimal. In this game, however, there is no such thing; turns get divided amongst individuals. Who gets to act when during a round is determined by the initiation; the higher it is the sooner your members get to go. Performing sooner than an enemy is obviously beneficial since you can apply status effects (ex. stunned) or even kill before it gets the chance to act. That being said, having one of your members perform before another is not necessarily a good thing; here's an example.   There is a mage who is just about dead, and it's your turn. The character you are using at the moment is a melee build and doesn't have enough action points to reach and finish off the mage. You do however have an archer who could finish the job, except you have to wait until his turn. It just so happens that the mage gets to go before the archer and uses healing thus avoiding death. As a result of this, the battle goes on longer than it should have and in the end, you end up defeated. Perhaps this example is extreme, but it gets my point across; it's a rigid system which prevents you from using your members in a logical and strategic order. It's possible to delay a member's turn, but this isn't very helpful since you can't use it once any points get spent. Also, it puts that member at the very end of the round instead of swapping places with another team-mate. To summarize, the initiation system is inflexible and anti-strategy which goes against the whole idea of turn-based combat.   CONCLUSION  Despite people praising this game for its flexibility, it's ironically rigid which made me feel like I wasn't able to play the way I wanted to. I wish I my final impressions were better, but there were too many flaws. Ultimately, I give Divinity: Original Sin 2 a PAR of 1.  IMPORTANT: I use PARS instead of a standard 1-10 scale.

The game world is just packed with stuff to do - every few steps you bump into something new happening. And thats above and below ground, as the game features quite a lot of caves, dungeons, ancient ruins, cellars, and even a pocket universe. The player has always plenty options to chose from how to proceed. Abilities like persuasion or lockpicking are really useful, and talking to animals is just awesome. The story is serious in tone, with many mature subplots, but its not lacking some needed moment to moment humor either (usually when doing side missions, not as unnecessary comic relief to main line). There are many memorable characters & situations. The companions are great and well fleshed out, each of them quite distinct. Their stories often intertwine with the main plot, so they all feel relevant.  While the game is fantasy in nature, and there are plenty of things were used to, there are also many quirks and ideas unique only to this world. Enough for it to feel fresh most of the time.  Its not perfect though (but close). There are limits to what you can do, although there is very high chance you'll be able to execute most plans you come up with. The pacing was a little weird as well - the 2nd area with Driftwood was just too huge and not particularly structured. They might have been aiming at more open feel after the initial island, but it just turned out to be tiring by the end of it, and I couldnt wait to get out of there. Im aware that if I wasnt a person hell bent on scouring every inch of the map, and doing absolutely everything, I might feel otherwise, but thats just the way I like to play, so that part didnt mesh well with my game style. I had to take a break a bit after that, but later areas, Nameless Isle and Arx were great again :)   Part of that issue might have been due to combat, there was just too much of it for my taste. The combat at first is quite confusing, since many useful skills are too spread out between different lines, and it introduces some new concepts like surfaces. Then you get the hang of it, and its fun for some time, and later o"

The plot is incoherent, and succedes in being boring even if you go out of your way to find and keep track of everything. The characters are broadly uninteresting and pointless to care about. Game is so easy that you'll fall asleep if you take the handful of meta abilities. If you refuse to, playing the game becomes about as fun as trying to suck the??????out of your own?????   Achievements in multiplayer do not work consistently. The game is full of coding errors to steal your turn out from under you like how cutscene transitions work.. or just whenever the game feels like it should consume all your AP. Hitboxes randomly glitch out, attacks phasing through enemies on occasion. Line of Sight system is a the mercy of halfassed collision boxes on the geometry. Either being too generous or many times bigger than the model at random.   The split armor system is the worst development decision I have ever seen in my life. Which is the root cause of many of the others.  Trying to play this single player is a completely soulless experience."

The game is still incredibly open-ended and allows for all sorts of emergent gameplay. The writing is better, with more developed companions and a more layered story. Combat is deeper, with the addition of physical and magic armor that prevent you from immediately CCing enemies at the start of a fight. Now you have to carefully choose who to focus down first while considering your own defenses. On Tactician difficulty, the AI is good at picking targets and countering your moves so you definitely need to think two steps ahead. Elevation is a significant factor in combat as well, with ranged attack damage, range and line of sight being affected. There's also a much wider variety of enemies and spells/abilities, along with an expanded crafting system. Finally, the game is huge. It's about twice as big as the first game and there's no filler. Every quest, combat encounter and dungeon is carefully crafted and rewarding to play.   The only flaw is the UI. Managing your inventory is pretty cumbersome. Part of the problem is that the game is technically playable with a single character and each character in the party is treated as a solo player, so there's no shared inventory. When you're trading with a merchant, you can only access one character's inventory at a time, making it difficult to compare item stats. Trading prices are also affected by character-specific traits, so you'll need to first move the items you want to sell to the character who will get the best prices. Also, the game doesn't do a good job of explaining the many status effects. Some are self-explanatory, like Bleeding or Burning. Others, like Suffocating or Deaf, are not. Basically, the only way to learn what these do is to apply them or have them applied in combat. Larian should learn from Obsidian here and provide tooltip explanations anywhere you see status effects mentioned.  Overall, a fantastic game that would be even better with a few UI improvements."

227,Shabby,165,9,3,2018-02-12,Not Recommended,111.3,"Cant recomend. While the first act is tight and well crafted, offering you some inetersting story bits as long as you are willing to search for them and have the right NPC for them. But to be honest the whole game goes down hill fast once you get to level 5-6 because some major things happen. Crafting becomes usless, you will never need to craft anything in the game (Except a rare potion if you are not running hydrosophist), nor can you upgrade your arms and armor anymore as you could in the first game. Now, lets encounter an interesting thing i found in this game near the end of the act 1. You will find and fight a particular npc, and i made sure he was dead, i killed him, made him explode in a burst of blood smoke and meat bits, as well as tearing off his face. Yet he apears alive and well a few seconds latter, while the NPC around it say: ""Yeah, you did not kill him, he is allive."" And once you kill him again the NPC go: ""Yeah... he escaped, his boddy disapeared."" At this point i realised that you cant kill any important NPC and nothing you say will influence the main story except at  particular key points. In another addition to problems of this game is: The tone is harsher, but it does not work for the story the game tells. Going in to minor spoilers the game deals with the questions of faith, trust, divinity (obviously) and use of mass weapons of destructions, bloodshed, racism, religious zelotry and just cruelty. I think you can see why the tone can be incosistent and why the grimer and darker tone does not work for the tail of Faith, Trust and Divinity. And the game really tries to keep hammering down the point that: ""THIS IS A GRIM WORLD, WE WANT TO BE LIKE DARK SOULS!"" But its more like salt and sanctuary, throwing strung up corpses and skeletons and other gory stuff to create an atmosphere. The perks got cut down and now there is way less of them and some of them are just pointless, like ice king and demon, or ambidextry and slingshot.  Persuasion boiled down from a little game of rock, paper, scissors in to a skill check that... granted, makes no god damn sense. If there is a persuaion event you will get dialogue options that will have [Strength], [Dexterity] or [Intelegence] or any other stat before them, and you know what? They might as well have removed those little stamps, because they do nothing, if you have 50 strength and the persuasion event requieres 1 persuasion and you have 0, you will loose. Some of them are imposible and some of them are an auto pass, and while it does make sense, it points to the fact that there is no need in having persuasion as your social stat, especially considering that you get so few points. Socail skills (or stats): The only ones you need are Lucky charm, Thievery and Loremaster. Everything else is usless, and not like it even matters, you can change your character stats any time you want once you get in to the second act. What else? What else? Ah, yes, the armor. Its an awfull idea, while the first game was more about resistance and chance, this game goes bananas and says: Its all or nothing! So you can get yourself stunned for 8 turns in a row and hate your life. Also there is... something going on with the game where you can get stunned or frozen out of nowhere. The quests are rather boring and there is not much way of completing them other then the single way it was ment to be finished. Some of them cant even be finished, for some reason. In addition i must add that there are major techincal problems like the game taking 5 GB of ram and dying, on the regular bases, stutters and freezes, and some times your saves might actually not save, so check for that twise, i lost about 4-5 hours of progress in a coop game because of that. The second act is a mess, its just a bunch of stuff thrown around with no direction, its like your high scool budy wants to create a DnD sandbox adventure, and does not make any hooks for quests, so you end up aimlesly wondering around and talking to NPC in search of a thing to do. Companions are wierd, while i have been playing a lone woolf with Ifan on my side i found that he takes my acts of friendship like an excuse to put something up his bumm. At one point we got in to a conversation at one of the ins, he got himself and my character a cup of ale (or beer, does not matter), and procided to make conversation, at one point he said: ""Its good to have you by my side"" or some such, and i decided to answer: ""I enjoy your company"", now i thought its going to be like: ""Yeah, its nice traveling with you, you are after all of great assist in battle and your sharp wits keep our spirits up during the travel"" Ifan took it as: ""You want smash?"" and procedeed to blush. I might add that i was playing a 2.4m male bright red lizzard. So the only one receaving smashing would be Ifan.  So far i got to the end of Act 1 and... i really cant recomend the game for any one looking for a good time with an RPG, i would rather sugest playing the first game and droping it half way thro. Thats the best time you are going to get with this series."

Absolutely nothing I've very played can top this game in its gravitas. The story is clever and riveting from the beginning to the end, and keeps the player rabidly invested in the development of both the characters and the state of the world. The story is supported masterfully by the (fully voice acted) dialogue, ambient music, and gorgeous art.   The combat in this game just... makes sense. Veterans of RPG games will have no trouble understanding the system, but even newcomers to the genre can pick it up in the space of a few battles. The game's combat continues to throw you curveballs in terms of player and enemy abilities, but they all fit snugly within the bounds of the overarching system. You'll feel like a strategist, unconsciously planning out the best ways to apply your characters' different abilities to best slay enemies with different armour types and quantities.  Divinity is an apt title for this franchise. The gameplay, story, and aesthetics are all worthy of that mantle. I could honestly see this game as a contender for best RPG of all time."

[Cat]: 'TIS A TERRIBLE DAY, INNIT? ? *shows dialogue options* Divinity: Original Sin 2 has reached new heights of what it is to be expected on huge Indie Games. Made by Larian Studios, it was able to level with AAA games that it even surpasses the standards, regardless of its flaws.  You'll play as your own character in the story, and embark on a journey towards the world of Rivellon as you find the answer to the cause of the Void's awakening. You could also play as one of the six main characters with their own unique story if character creation is not your thing.  Also, quicksaving before doing anything else is a must. Talk to someone, quicksave first. Interacting an item, quicksave first. Opening a door, quicksave. After an autosave, quicksave.  REVIEW The game is very similar to its previous title, Divinity: Original Sin (DOS1). There may be changes, but there's nothing too drastic as far as I've observed.   STORYDOS2 moved towards a more interesting Plot. While it still does have DOS1's lighthearted ""HaHa""s, the studio was able to put the humor at the right spot. In a way, they're able to make a decently captivating tale for an RPG. What's so interesting about the plot's flow is that the game doesn't make you feel like you need to save the world because when you want to go somewhere, doing so will progress your main story. The linearity is barely present that I didn't even know which quest I should keep my focus on my first playthrough.   It's quite unfortunate, for me at least, how the game treats the Party Interaction on the whole story as it progresses because it had less... interaction. Back in DOS1's party interaction, you're able to choose a dialogue for everyone. DOS2 removed that feature and only allows you to choose a dialogue for your main character only; however, in turn they added an Attitude system, so your party members and everyone else in the game have their own morals and beliefs. In the end, it sadly lowers the replayability. GAMEPLAYOn the matter of the game's Quest System, I become lost throughout my first playthrough. Given that most of your progress relates to the main story, a quest that I've ignored for an in-game day (since I'm focusing on a particular quest at that time) suddenly updates along with the quest I'm currently taking. There are some cases during an update to my current quest, a new quest opens up in my journal. In a long run, the quest log became flooded to a point that I don't know which quest would I continue.  The turn-based Combat System is really great. Given how there's hundreds of skills and hardly countable ways of killing an enemy, the fact that good positioning actually gives an advantage, it's hard to get bored of it. Unlike many turn-based games, the Original Sin series shines on how your surroundings affect you and your enemy's strategy. The lit torch stand, the oil puddle poured near an explosive barrel, the sea shore, everything is interactive. In DOS2, the height advantage was a great addition.  The game's Challenge is the one that sparks its replayability. It's not just how unfair some items/skills are, it's the moment when the AI actually knows how, where, and when to use the environment and situation to their advantage. Once you've come up with a different build, their playstyle changes. They are annoyingly smart that sometimes they're three turns ahead of you if you're not aware enough.  Carelessly set a trap mine near an enemy, one of them will then teleport you on top of it. Enemies even face behind a wall just so your Rogue character can't backstab him/her. Although, there is a time when a hazardous area is too wide, the AI keeps on walking around the said area until they die instead of just standing still. It has its awful moments sadly. AESTHETICSComparing the two of the series, DOS2 was able to utilize more graphical features which made it far more detailed than DOS1. It shifted from a cartoony colorful vibe into a more realistic and bleak environment. Even so, the Graphics were decent at best.   The Music score is an improvement from the previous title. Just comparing the two themes, you could say that they have more budget this time haha. It's interesting how you could select your character's instrument theme, so you could hear a particular instrument on certain occasions depending on what you chose for one of your characters. As much as how catchiness goes however, it's not as grand as what I always hear from Bioware and Bethesda games. For short, DOS2's music is ingenuinely good.  Sample OST I personally liked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxuC0i5S_LE For a game that lacks flashy CGI cinematics, they were able to compensate it with the expressive Voice Dialogues. You've gotta hand it to the voice actors and scriptwriters for making their characters and npcs feel alive. It's interesting how most of them have something to say inside and outside of the conversation. FEATURESFor a turn-based game, the Playability is good. Besides the 4 player multiplayer, there's couch co-op and controller support. The game is playable in any way but 3-4 splitscreen multiplayer, yet it's still rare to find such accessibility this time around in video games.  Game Master Mode is a cool feature that you can't believe it's included on the standard game. Though, I'm not fond of Dungeons and Dragons, it really seems that's what it's trying to make out of this game mode. In my case, this is a casual DnD that includes the game's character abilities and such. An interesting mode to say the least.  Arena Mode is a decent feature if you're up for some PvP duels. Besides the fact that you could play online, there's an offline mode called Hot Seat where you and your fellow players play in one device.  Lastly, this game has the Classic Edition (CE) which removes tons of new dialogues and enemy encounters along with the updated User Interface for controller users from the Definitive Edition.

Here, you will get truth.  Hard cold truth.  Allow me to put on my ""GIT GUD"" armor on.  Ok now that's on.    I resent having to ""study ahead"" for my fights, even on one step ahead of casual difficulty.   When I engage in a fight for the first time, 95% of the time, I get jacked, hard.  By the way second easist difficulty name escapes me.  The mechanics of this game are amazingly unforgiving.  Yes yes, youtube videos, walk throughs on character develpment, blahblahblah.  I love watching youtube videos of people with 45 strength or 50 finesse when I have 15 and maxxed out all I could.  I expect a challenge when I fight.  I don't expect to try moving the coffins over here and lead this one guy out alone, or telekinesis this over there to build a wall to prevent mobs that I have no previous knowledge of them being there in the first place.  Sun Tzu would have killed to have the preknowledge it takes to win some fights in this game.  I hear plenty of talk about how this is a herald back to the old gold box D&D games, or a reminder of how it used to be in D&D with a DM reading off the descriptions for the module some of us were playing on a Saturday night.  DM never let us look at the notes and see where the monsters were hanging, and what their hit points were.  At least, mine didn't.  Yours?  Battle won after the third youtube video watched, 2nd or 3rd hour reloading the game, treasure collected.  It seems... hollow.  Onto the next series of saving - reloading.  Bottom line, I like a challenge, not a flogging.  This is a flogging.  Unclear battle mechanics, and get ready to wear out your F5 key.  6/10 "

1773,Noobsauce,83,2,0,2018-02-18,Recommended,335,"Pros:  Amazing roleplaying/DnD feel. Interesting characters, witty writing, and I haven't played a game that left you this many choices since Fallout New Vegas (almost anyone can be killed at any time). Highly recommend playing one of the ""Origin"" players, or if not, at least having them as your party members, a lot of the great story telling revolves around them.  Combat system is fun and allows for a lot of theory crafting/playstyles, to the point where even people who dont' care about the RP aspect of it at all still enjoy this game. Few gripes with certain aspets but overall it feels interesting/diverse. Fights are HARD, even on normal difficulty, but far from unbeatable.   This game handles multiplayer in what is essentially a single player world better than any other game I've ever seen. The game is coded like an MMO, so you and your friends can travel hafl way across the world in a random pub and your friend can still play their game. Seemlessly allows you to hop in and out of someone's game too.  Cons:  Some weird quirks with combat that could be improved (fighting with characters while others are in dialogue, main attributes feeling uninterseting), but really this is just a tiny complaint.  In the mid part of the game it's easy to lose focus, it's so open world that you can get bogged with side quests and forget what you were supposed to be doing in the first place.  Crafting system/Inventory system feels a little meh. Crafting can honestly be 100% ignored so this  doesn't detract from the game too much, but organizing /sorting through your inventory can feel tedious at times."

It promises oldschool creativity, but only captures the frustration of having a poorly developed combat system. While the combat system becomes more intuitive as the session goes on, I don't think the fact that it becomes bareable after a lengthly attempt at the game should justify the system.   Graphics and voice acting are on point and the art style will make you wish that the actual game portion of the video game was more fun."

As someone who works full time, I don't have the time (or, honestly, the interest) in playing a game that requires me to play ALL THE TIME to keep up with everyone else. Adversely, I'm usually pretty bored with single player games.  I also hate turn-based games.  Despite that, I was browsing the most-purchased in the Steam store and decided on buying this game after reading the reviews.   This game took me about a month to complete, and I clocked in 75 hours. I can't even remember the last time a campaign took me more than 8 hours.... I actually was interested in what NPC's had to say, talked to everyone, opened every chest, etc. Not because I felt I had to, but because I really loved the game that much. Also, if I had played this game without looking up most of the quests online, it would've taken me at least double that time.  The combat was super fun, even though it was turn based. I was constantly looking for new spellbooks, planning out my rotations, etc.  It was also challenging - I really had to make sure my party was well-equipped and balanced in their abilities.  There were some fights I had to retry a few times, and it felt like more of a fun challenge than a tedious part of the gameplay.    After finishing the game, I'm going to go back and replay it a second time with a different strategy and a slightly higher difficulty.  I loved everything about this game, even though it's not my usual style of game at all - anyone who's on the fence, I definitely recommend it!"

I paid full price for this one, and I am very pleased with the purchase.  The application of turn-based combat mechanics to old-school RPG gameplay makes Divinity a very worthwhile experience. It's like Neverwinter Nights had a beautiful lovechild with Xcom. It's also a huge game with huge number of ways to play, and I particularly like that you can play it local-coop. My wife and I are always in the market for a good couch-coop game, and this one is spectacular.  My only complaint with the gameplay is that there is a LOT of inventory management required, at least if you want to i. have adequate gold and ii. don't want your inventory to look like a crazy bag lady got a hold of it. I've also found the game to be pretty buggy at times, though it's only actually crashed once in more than a hundred hours of gameplay."

46,Islendingen,320,11,0,2018-02-21,Not Recommended,48.2,"I loved D:OS so I picked this game up expecting something similar in way of feel and experience. At the start the feeling I got was kind of like that, but with characters that felt like they had more depth to them and a revamped combat system. My inital thought was ""I wonder how this will work out. Can't wait to see the full extent of it."" I felt like the first game needed an improvement on the combat system. I liked it, but at the same time it felt like it needed some improvements, something I hoped they had adressed in D:OS2.  What I met however was a combat system that, the further into the game I got, proved itself the most tedious gameplay I have ever experienced. The addition of armor wasn't much of a problem in the beginning. It just acted as a buffer to not go full CC at the start of combat. However the further I got the more armor the enemies got, and the more boring the game became for me. Having to spend 5-10 min just grinding down enemies armor hoping you can do enough dmg to their health before they use a spell or potion to buff their armor back up, feels like a bunch of kids screaming ""you can't hurt me because I got this special armor!"" As someone who really enjoyed playing a mage that could burn, freeze, charm or sleep enemies, I couldn't get over the way the armor makes every enemy immune to all this.  I tried to get over my feelings for quite some time, and I liked the rest of the game (the story, scenery, music and just random banter and funny stuff you encounter), but the combat system ruined the experience for me. That's why I would not recommend this game if you enjoyed the combat system in the first game at all."

I spent a lot of hours on this game, but I didn't finish it.  To me that's the ultimate cut off, if I grow tired of a game before actually completing it, I'm giving it a thumbs down.  I enjoyed Divinity 1 (and played the original Divine Divinity) so expected to like this game.  There were some improvements over Divinity 1.  The inventory system is more streamlined, you can look at all of your character's inventories in one big screen instead of having to swap between characters.  In addition, you can use an item or equip an item with any character from any inventory.  I also somewhat liked the storylines of the pregenerated characters better than in Divinity 1.  But honestly, other than that, I liked the first game much better.  Both games have an issue (at least this is a problem for me - others might not be bothered as much by it) that if you go the ""wrong direction"" you end up facing enemies that are too hard.  In several areas you end up having to test out different battles to see if they are doable at your level.  I have mixed feelings about this - it makes levelling feel meaningful but something like this feels more in line with a dark souls game than more of a standard RPG.  I don't particularly enjoy having to go back and see if I can do a fight yet 3 or 4 different times as I level up.  But as to specifics about Divinity 2 - to touch on my last point, the areas felt really unbalanced.  As I mentioned already, you have to test out battles in some areas to see if you can do them yet,  In others, not so much.  For example, Act II for me was a constant situation of trying to find the one area I could actually make progress on, since everything else was too hard.  Then Act III wasn't a problem at all, I never ran into a fight I couldn't handle.  Then Act IV (and this is the point that I just lost interest) there's a part where you get ambushed in several different spots by monsters that are higher level than my level as well as the level of everything else in the area.  Keep in mind I'd been attempting to complete every quest along the way, so I should have been at least close to the highest level I could have been at by that point.  I was also playing on normal difficulty and have a lot of experience playing these kinds of games (I know how to use terrain, split party, etc..).  I also disliked the change in how skills work from Divinity 1 to Divinity 2.  Divinity 1 had a Novice/Adept/Master system for learning skills.  Once raised your skill level to a certain point you could learn a certain amount of skills from each tier.  The higher level skills also had level reqs and had long cooldowns.  Divinity 2 changes all of that.  Instead it uses source points which are kind of like non regenerating mana points.  Starting with the mid level skills, all of the powerful skills require source points to cast, some as many as 3 points.  From a RPG standpoint that does make sense that as a Sourcerer you would need Source points to cast skills - however as a game mechanic I found it to be really annoying.  After each combat you basically have to either travel back to a place where you can refill Source, or cast a spell multiple times with each character out of combat to regain these points so that you can keep using these skills.  *And* in many cases these are the exact same skills (Arrow Spray for example) from Divinity 1 that didn't require Source then and in fact were used by your characters in that game who were Source HUNTERS - so after even a bit of thought, the whole concept that they are Sourcerer skills kind of falls apart.  The Divinity games utilize elemental combinations to create effects (fire, freezing, electricity, etc..) in combat.  Divinity 1 did a good job of this but this is another area in which Divinity 2 changed things for the worse in my opinion.  Div 1 had a good amount of abilities that caused elemental effects but it wasn't everything and it was relatively controllable.  Div 2 has so much that quite literally after almost every combat the entire area is just a giant lake of cursed fire.  It's not so much that this is deadly it's just not as clean of a system as in 1 where you could set certain areas on fire in a more controlled way.  In that game for example, you could create an area where enemies would have to cross that would quite often significantly damage them before they got to you.  This game, perhaps because it's so easy to just set everything on fire, the actual fire damage doesn't really feel significant and really makes the whole thing kind of pointless.  This game also introduces Magical and Physical Armor to the health system.  Basically each character and enemy has a certain amount of Magical and/or Physical armor.  Most attacks are considered one or the other type and will hit that type of armor first before they will damage the health of the target.  There are two reasons why I found this system to really not be an improvement.  First, a standard party will have a mix of damage.  I had a tank/melee fighter, a ranger and 2 wizards.  The wizards did almost exclusively magic damage and the other 2 did almost exclusively physical damage.  Most enemies have both physical and magical armor.  This creates a situation where you are almost always having to knock out *both* types of armor on enemies, or you have to split your damage to 2 different enemies which means you can't focus down anyone very fast.  In addition to this, almost all secondary effects (knockdown, stun, charm. etc..) don't work at all until you've broken through the type of armor that blocks them.  This made those effects much less useful than in Divinity 1 where you could immediately crowd control someone in a tough battle.  In Divinity 2 since you have to break through the armor first, by the point where you could CC someone, it's often almost as easy to just finish them off.  Making that whole aspect of combat (which was a big part of the first game) much less useful.  In the end, I got tired of continually having to reload because I stumbled upon something thrown in my path that was too hard, bored by the inability to use skills without having to constantly refill my source points and just lost interest overall.  I'm sure plenty of other people who aren't bothered as much by these mechanics would enjoy this game, but it wasn't for me.  "

There are many users experiencing problems like ""Connection to the Larian support server failed"" along with several others. I tried scouring the forums for fixes. After four different fix attempts and a reinstall, the game still didn't work. The message from the devs on this was that they were looking into it...a month ago. Also, they recommend disabling anti-virus. I know you can grant special access to specific programs. The way they put it out, it was as if you should shut off your anti-virus completely. Just seems as if they didn't really give the problem due consideration and doesn't inspire confidence that they'd respond to user feedback either. It appears that many folks don't have this problem, however; I saw quite a few others on the forums in the same situation I'm in.   Bottom Line: Unless you want to gamble with your time and money, I don't recommend this game. Save yourself a few wasted hours."

But i'm not gonna recommend it and here's why.  The game counters it's own logic. Tells you to do whatever you wants, put an emphasis on freedom, character creation, dialogue, roleplay, etc, but you must play EXACTLY like the developpers intended you to if you wanna succeed. That means, finishing as much quests as you can so your level is high enough for you to be able to win fights on your own terms. So the optional quests are in fact, mandatory. You don't like some quests ? Too bad, since you cannot grind because the mobs don't respawn. But that's not the whole story about quests. The maps are quite open, giving you the illusion of freedom, but when you discover a map for the first time, you'll realise that most of it is gated by high level mobs that are going to kill you outright if you engage combat against them, thus restricting the exploration the game strangely emphases, and forcing your hand into doing things in the exact order the devs wanted you to do them. If you try to do quest B before quest A, you will die because of how much a one or two level difference with your opponent means. That's not to mention the fact that some quests are gated behind a perk/stat/item requirment. It's like Cat Mario / Syobon Action, where you have levels loaded with traps and obstacles you can't possibly anticipate, so you finish them by dying on every single obstacle at least once and memorizing safe zones.  The combat system is also restricting, because of the way armor works, it's much more rewarding to set up all your characters into doing one type of damage (physical or magical) to finish fights quicker.  I wanted a wizard to support my knight but that would have been a bad idea. Because why would anyone lose time into emptying a full magical armor bar if the physical one has been grinded to zero through the physical attacks you already delivered ? Being able to do damage by mixing chemicals and using the environment is a good idea, the bad thing is that those chain-reactions are usually triggered early in the fight, be it by your own attacks or your opponent's, at a time where armors are not destroyed yet, thus nullifying many effects or debuffs they could create.  Nobody is sitting there, being like ""Omg this game is too hard, i can't advance !"" - people ARE advancing, but it is tedious and annoying. Not because it is ""omg, so oldschool, so hardcore"", but because the game fails to hold true to it's own principles and employs point-&-click adventure logic in many places. You are supposed to magically know how the devs wants you to approach a particular quest, area or fight. If you don't, you are going to fail, miss things, and die a lot. A good example of that would be Braccus pants. An item you can only find if your character is over a certain threshold in a certain stat, and make him interact with a particular item at a particular place, while nothing pointed that you should do that. There is a difference between not holding the player's hand and dumping them into a situation that cannot be managed unless you already have first hand experience or information.  So yeah, i wanted to love this game but it is simply not amusing. It's not a challenge in the sense that you have to improve your level of comprehension of mechanics that make sense, it's simply a matter of knowing things in advance. In Dark Souls, you can win fights on your own terms by, let's say, becoming very good at avoiding attacks and counter-attacking. Or you can be a god at min-maxing, setting up stats the right way to make a great build that's gonna make the game much easier. In DoS:2, you cannot win on your own terms. I should not have to steal every painting in the game to keep my economy flowing so i can buy gear to stay relevant in battle. I should not have to kill every non-quest related NPC so i can grind all the XP not to get crushed in battle. I should not have to back-stab bosses without talking to them and miss important story elements or sacrifice my amusement because of cheesy tactics being the only way to win some fights.  This ""You have to know it before you even attempt"" mechanic is not bad as is. I have no real problem with games that does that, however, i have one if they advertise themselves as putting the emphasis on player choice while it's clearly not how the game is designed to be played."

0,Zac,383,7,2,2018-02-26,Not Recommended,201.2,"I have never been more ambivalent about a game before in my life. I have never played a game with such amazing concepts and potential, squandered by fundamental failings of game design.  The fine first, second, and third acts, while plagued with the issues I am going to discuss, are not nearly as horrible as the absolutely baffling experience of act 4. All issues previously felt in the game are so excacerbated in act 4, that I thought I was playing an entirely different game.  1. The armor system incentivizes perversely unfun tactics. With the recent changes of taunt, they have thankfully recognized this. Nonetheless, it causes both the players and the AI to initially launch into DEFCON 1 tier nuclear exchange, with the victor emerging as the one to freeze, knockdown, or terrify (fittingly, the most terrifying effect constantly abused by the AI) their opponent. When the encounters start becoming quite difficult, this exchange can pretty much decide the outcome of the battle in 2 turns.  2. The AI in this game is awful. They are completely incapable of working to together and effectively chaining combos. So, in compensation, the developers have simply cheated ridiculous stats onto the AI, often allowing them 6 AP regen per turn, insane armor values, and a divinity level capability of using source. At one instance, a random AI sourcerer had an initiative of 50... why? It inexplicably had a base initiative of +20... If you encounter an enemy called 'nemisis,' evacuate to your nearest fallout shelter because they deserve the title of godwoken over all else.  3. Rapid descent into over-designed gimmick encounters, often with no communication of what to do. Act 4 is especially egregious about this. I have no idea why they decided endlessly respawning enemies, ambushes, and gimmick bosses  were good ways of designing a game, but it is not. It shows complete insecurity in their combat system that they needed to replace every regular fight with some poor attempt at twisting the formula. Ultimately, it either ends with the player figuring out the gimmick and beating the encounter easily, or a frustrating cycle of save cheesing until the correct tactic is found. Its like... the previous 3 courses of this game's meal was just a delicious italian dinner, and instead of desert being a logical extension of what came before it, its dog diarrhea plated to look like chocolate mousse... yeah... its unique, but its ????ing?????? Just like every late game fight in this game.  Unfortunately, the game's stellar writing was unable to save the experience for me. I honestly recommend turning on explorer mode if you do decide that is what you want to get out of this game."
80,NaniCat,124,29,8,2018-02-27,Not Recommended,264,"I've played this game a good bit, and while on some levels I enjoy it. I think the reality of it is that I WANT to enjoy it far more than I do. The game has a rich environment, and great game feel that takes me back to the 'good ole' days' of playing baldurs gate and icewind dale and the like, however... there's some seriously massive problems with the game; Namely, Balance and Diversity.  When I say Balance, the game has been scaled horribly, a good example is warfare, being... the end all be all for literally any physical damaging characters, INCLUDING necromancer. playing a rogue? max warfare, playing a ranger? yup... max warfare... All of this becomes even more problematic when you include issues with the other big problem; Armour and Resistances.  The twist of the knife is that they seperated armour into magic armour, and physical armour; meaning that enemies (and players) essentially have 3 health pools, while different effects are resisted by different armor pools, these pools must be diminished to get into the juicy meat of the quintessential problem. not only is magic simply inherently worse because of the otherwise RANDOM elemental resistances enemies have, meaning that your fire mage may end up useless in some situations, your melee and physical damage dealers will encounter almost no issues (only one is an otherwise exploitative style 'bug' (feature?) of a few key enemies using an evasive aura that gives them and all their allies a 90% chance to dodge, it's quite stupid).  So, this means two things, A. having a split damage type group means you're effectively doubling your enemies health/armour pools, and B. many builds are completely dysfunctional because of poor scaling mechanics and skill sets affecting your abilities in nonsense ways, The witch is a great example of this ( a starting character class that is little more than a noob trap) as daggers scale with finesse, necromancer abilities scale with intelligence, and all their physical damage scales with... warfare.   For the more than 200 hours i've played in this game, I can say I enjoyed some of the game, but I can also say that due to bugs, poor game design for multiplayer co-op (I laid on the ground dead due to a bug while the end of the game cutscene went for my friend and i got to see none of it, it was an absolutely awful experience). I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME, but sadly, it needs a serious rework of the fundamental principles that it's based on before it could potentially be any actual good."

Said DM really fell in love with the cosmology and deities section of the Dungeon Master's Guide as well as the idea of creating an epic, REALLY LONG arc where his players eventually achieve godhood. Mr. DM also put an awful lot of time into fleshing out his world and making sure you know that HIS elves are DIFFERENT (they EAT people and get their MEMORIES, see), though for some reason he decided to keep his dwarves Scottish.  This DM is not perfect and has his faults. For one, he really loves throwing environmental effects all over the battlefield to the point of it becoming annoying. Fire spreads 50 feet in an arc! Now ice shoots out over the fire! Now smoke and lighting and tentacles spread atop the fire and ice! Yeah! Near the end of the campaign, his planning starts to slip, both in combat design and in lore. For instance, he offers his players a variety of different endings to their grand adventure, but none of them are all that great, and one gets the feeling that he randomly chose the final boss by just flipping through the Monster Manual with the intent of picking a Challenge Rating 30 beastie just to tell his other DM friends that ""I PUT MY PLAYERS UP AGAINST THIS GUY ONCE AND THEY KIND OF SURVIVED!""   After playing for nearly 140 hours, though, none of his players can say it wasn't an epic time at the table. They'll probably be back for more.

44,Shard of Manus,41,75,1,2018-03-13,Recommended,177.4,"Divinity Original Sin 2 - Larian's second foray into the grand re-imagining of the Divinity universe, and one can only say... they really outdid themselves this time.   Larian Studios takes a bold step into the old RPG style that players were so enamoured by with the original Divine Divinity, only with all the polish of modern capabilities, and the extremely successful and informative release of Divinity Original Sin (and its Enhanced Edition) granting them insight into the necessary improvements that make DOS2 the absolute masterpiece that it is.   Players can be sure to find themselves trapped within this game for such lengths of time that the outside world shall begin to pass by unnoticed, as one becomes so transfixed with the beauty of Larian's latest release. Divinity Original Sin 2 is perhaps the most engaging, exciting, satisfying and well-designed Adventure RPG of the decade... and that is quite the title to fight for.   -----------------   The world of DOS2 is massive. Hours upon hours upon hours of dense, creative and unique content stacked together in this vibrant and stunning game world. Every location itself is chock full of fantastic characters, all fully voiced with quality acting, and each with a rich and realistic personality and story that drive the player's desire to uncover every ounce of their story and build upon the deep lore and sprawling history of the world of Divinity.   The main campaign spans four Acts, each filled to the brim with hours of non-linear content including side quests, treasure hunts, battles, secrets to be uncovered and more all with multiples ways to be completed and numerous outcomes - and with such immense amounts of freedom and player choice, the likes of which almost no modern game can compete with, there really is no dull moment in Divinity, and this game is a shining example of the effort and dedication Larian puts into their work.   -----------------   The combat of DOS2 has been revamped since the previous release, though maintaining much of what it once was. Divinity Original Sin 2, like its predecessor, adopts turn-based combat, and turns it into one of the most finely crafted and perfect editions of this style of combat to date. Every moment of battle is exciting and even for one such as I, whom rarely plays turn-based games, the combat was astoundingly well designed and thoroughly enjoyable.   Players command all manner of skills thanks to the diverse customisation options available and freedom of choice, with crafting bombs, traps, potions, poisons, arrows and much, much more, players will always find themselves with an array of tools with which to combat the enemy. No class is tied to any particular tree of skills, and one can mix and match as they see fit... provided they learn how to best use such abilities.   DOS2 encourages interactivity with the environment, and players have much freedom to use objects, terrain and combinations of attacks for devastating effects. If there is oil, set it ablaze. If there is water, freeze it so that your enemies slip. The combinations are many, and are far deeper and complex than just those above. This game holds some of the most complex and intriguing combat systems I know.   Combat is by no means forgiving, and the game boasts a variety of difficulty options that make enemies easier, or expand their skills sets and AI intelligence such as that they pose worthy adversaries to even well skilled players.   -----------------   Something brought to players for the first time in Divinity Original Sin makes its triumphant return in DOS2, and that is the wonderfully designed multiplayer aspect. Drop-in / drop-out co-op allows players to seamlessly enter the world of another player and join them on their journey... be they ally or foe.   The multiplayer system is beyond extensive, and to the delight of some players, and the woe of others, players can act as friend or foe on their journey - and betrayal is a sweet thing.   The absolute freedom of the multiplayer system does have its faults however, as playing with strangers can sometimes lead to them rushing through things, progressing without you or making choices that you didn't want to make. It is highly recommended that players save co-op until after their first playthrough, or only play with friends that one can communicate with easily and rely on. DOS2s world is too big and too grand to risk someone spoiling it for you.   However, in my experience, playing DOS2 with a friend or two (or 3) is an inimitable experience that all should try. Working together or against one another towards the finale of this game is thrilling beyond imagination.   -----------------   So, alongside the beautifully crafted world, intricate characters, massive freedom of choice, expansive customisation and awesome combat, Divinity Original Sin 2, much like other installments in the series, boasts an amazing soundtrack.   Composed by Borislav Slavov, DOS2s soundtrack combines epic scores, emotional pieces and the jovial warmth of tavern music in one of the best compositions of the year and even beyond, rivalling that of Hollow Knight, NieR: Automata and potentially even the Witcher 3.   With traditional styles of RPG music reminiscent of golden oldies, each with its own unique flair and spark, and returning tracks from other Divinity titles, the music of Larian's latest game is something no-one will not enjoy. Hours of beautiful tracks, some of which are placed so heart-wrenchingly well within the game world that you will no doubt be straight onto YouTube and listening to the whole lot for hours.   With everything else DOS2 has to offer, the Soundtrack really is the cherry on top, and it is something to behold.   -----------------   To summarise Divinity Original Sin 2 into one word, it would have to be... brave. Larian Studios started the development of this game precariously, via Kickstarter backing; and after the amazing success of Divinity Original Sin, they had certainly garnered enough interest to support their new installment. Their return to old school RPG styles was a risk that paid off... not because the style is popular, but because Larian took something good, and turned it into something beyond great.   DOS2 is, and will no doubt remain for some time, among my favourite games of all time. I have sunk so many hours into this game, through several playthroughs and still each new one is unique and engaging. Here is a timeless game. Play it, with all my heart, I tell you to play it."

I use no hyperbole when I say this is the best RPG I've played thus far.   Pros   Fantastic score. Whether it be running around Fort Joy, taking in the sights on the Lady Vengeance, or amid an intense battle, the music sticks with you all the way through. I've been listening to some tracks repeatedly since first hearing them.   One of the deepest RPGs in terms of choice. A task such as escaping an island ends up having a plethora of options for you to achieve your goal. Want to sneak through a secret dungeon guarded by fire slugs? Sure why not. Want to get out simply by taking a boat? Go for it! Oh what's that? You want to cheat the system and simply teleport yourself and party into various edges until you manage your way out? You got it!   Wonderfully engaging story; filled with plenty of characters that are hard to forget. Don't forget the pet pal perk to talk to all of those animals around you! (Beware, you will be sad a lot of times talking to them.) Off put by the concept of reading a ton of dialogue? (Why are you buying this...) then worry not! Every single character (and animal) is fully voiced with some amazing VO work. However, the story did let me down in a few small ways, but I'll get to that soon.   Mods mods mods! The community has been excellent at coming up with some very inventive and fun mods to use throughout your adventure. Anything from new classes, new spells, revamping certain systems, and if you're a glutton for punishment - mods that make the game even harder. Cons  Remember how I mentioned how amazing the story was? Yeah, well thats for the majority! As some others have mentioned, going into the final act and ending, there are some definite inconsistencies with the quality of writing and apparently attention to lore. (I've never played any other Divinity games;  I was unaware until doing further research.) For a game that boasts such a wide range of choices and how they really matter; the ending(s) seemed largely basic and almost unrelated to your adventures throughout the game.   Technical problems. Any game of this size will be bound to suffer from some technical issues, I completely get that. Overall, it was nothing major - apart from one game breaking bug I encountered causing some invisible enemies to 1 hit KO me, but luckily, I had a save from not long before that I managed to get back to and the problem seemed to have fixed itself. While the bugs weren't outright angering - in the final act I did find myself getting increasingly peeved by the buildup of several small bugs affecting my experience. At times enemies will take AGES to take their turn - leaving you to simply sit there and watch them and their idle animation until they finally realize they should be doing something.    Tech probs cont. The camera and reticule would at times completely spaz out and throw itself in a random direction and would continue to do so whenever trying to target certain areas or enemies. This may have been due to some mods interfering with the code, but at times my journal would be completely wiped of all data - leaving me to have to remember what quests I still needed to do.   Balance issues. Exploring the various locales sometimes leads you into areas where you are WOEFULLY unprepared or situations that unless you had prior knowledge, are borderline impossible to defeat. While it didn't bug me too much, I frequently encountered some dialogue/enemies that upon entering the fight would instant kill my party, use the same skill numerous times with seemingly no "
164,Olnia,129,7,3,2018-03-13,Not Recommended,71.5,"An honest review about Divinity: Original Sin 2.  Divinity 2 leaves me with bittersweet feelings about the future of storytelling in general for video games.   This game started off so amazingly well; the plot, gameplay and character detail in everything you did was what drew me into playing a top-down adventure RPG for hours a day.   In a time of completely over-the-top FPS games and reckless abandon-style ""story-driven"" RPGs about covert operation soldiers, as concieved by one completely insane Japanese man (ala Metal Gear Solid: 1-anything), this game is a breath of fresh air and the reason why I felt compelled to write a formal review for the first time ever.  The gameplay is top notch for a turn-based RPG; with tactics and interuption strategies taking precedent over gear investment and level-grinding.   This is truly the ""thinking man's RPG"", forcing players on higher difficulties to make careful decisions in almost every scenario.   Formulating balanced parties and covering individual weaknesses is key to success, as the game will take every chance to test your combat readiness.     The customization is very good; only lacking in some of the most abstract and long-term of considerations.   One such example is: min-maxing characters into specific roles essentially becomes non-existant after the second act of the game, as you find a way to alter and re-distribute character skill points into anything you like, at any time.   This really detracts from the overall committment I thought I was forced into making, as early on in the game I was carefully analyzing every level-up I recieved, so as to maximize my party's adaptability.     (SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARD)    That however, is only a formality when compared to the story and its ending: wow, I don't think I have ever seen such a great story completely destroyed by it's ending since the iconic Ultima series (ironic as I have compared this game series to our generation's Ultima).     The Plot starts off amazing; a quest to ascend and become gods, retaking a long-vacant, world-ruler throne as the new ascended Divine.    The notes of long-term D&D campaings called me into playing this game, as one of the atractions of playing D&D long-term is to eventually become a god of a particular focus and take up the responcibilities of said god.     This game has no intention of letting you rule anything.      I know I'm basically spoiling the ending for you, but this game was clearly rushed due to monetary restrictions.   The final act of the game, which should be the most diverse and spraling location of the entire world of Rivelon, is oddly boring and lacks any focused polish.   The endings of tag-line quests are scatter-shot in terms of satisfaction; some (mainly Lohse's quest) leave you feeling like something meaningful was acomplished and are now closer to your companion as a result, while others feel dull and rushed, making the entire story of traveling with this companion feel worthless.     The final ending: sucks.    It really sucks; leaving the players feel like they are in a rejected Highlander-style fan fiction, the ending boils down to convincing your companions to accept your divinity over theirs, overwise taking their heads in confrontation to prove that there can only be one.   While the final boss battle is epic and challenging, ultimately the choice boils down to several options that you don't care about and, quite frankly, do not represent the intentions of the players who invested almost a hundred hours into playing this game.   After everything I had learned from playing this game in its entirety; my ultimate decision to rule Rivelon was subverted by a speech desicion I had made two hours before the ending when I lied to someone to gain their favor, a decision which was made practically applicable over the course of the entire game and never punished me for making such a desicion.     While the game has its flaws (It has major flaws!!!) it is highly enjoyable to play alone or with friends in Multiplayer.   While I hate the ending that basically aborts all your work throughout the story, the game provides a combat/D&D replication system so addictive, that this is the first top-down RPG I have played in over a decade.   Ignoring the crappy ending to the story, this game is a great way to waste an entire week on the computer if you choose to get invested in its gameplay.  Thanks for reading"

Now I refeunded this game shortly after buying it and I should not have purchesed it at all in the first place, but, thats my fault. I STRONGLY encourage you you to do solid research on this game before purchasing it. I made the mistake of assuming it was going to be a dressed up diablo clone.

181,Texas Ranger,83,4,1,2018-03-14,Not Recommended,58.4,"Let's see, where do I start...  The controls are clunky. About a quarter of the time you don't click on what you want to click on. I've had characters run across the map instead of firing an arrow. This also applies to interacting with objects. Also, the inventory system is horrendous. Moving objects between characters is a complete pain, and you literally have to drag and drop if they're standing too close to each other (and the inventory screen 'conveniently' expands if you have lots of objects, so you might need to scroll between transfers). When trading, you can't key in the amount of cash you want to include in a trade so you're left with a scroll bar with ticks that are too large. Also, say you want to purchase an object for character 2, but character 1 is the one with the trading skills? If you change characters to take a look at their equipment, the trade closes.   It's buggy. I've had characters randomly lose the ability to talk to other characters - the dialogue boxes flicker on, then disappear, and you have to hunt for the latest save that isn't bugged.  It's slow. Like XCOM2, it wastes your time with pointless pauses between actions. A 'fight' can end up taking half an hour in the best case just because its so slow.  Lots of fake difficulty. There are plenty of fights where you simply can't plan ahead a turn or two, because some scripted event will take place. After you know it'll happen, you can exploit it and win. Typically, you're underpowered in fights, so its very luck dependent: if the AI 'decides' to focus your characters, you'll probably lose. Alternatively, if the enemy gets a few lucky rolls, it'll also wipe your party. And then you take another half hour for the fight because its so slow...  ""It's not hard. It's stupid."" Like flipping a coin until you get heads 100 times in a row is 'hard'."

It is really the exact same story with the factions just having different names. Graphically it is in no way a step up from Dragon Age 2, not even comparing to DA 3's graphics. Combat systems it is not even competitive with other RPG's with its faulty armor system. Patches tend to break more than they fix.. and tend to screw up save games.   This game does have some good aspects to it, the Origin characters and their individual stories are interesting enough. You are not bound to a specific class, giving you greater build freedom than in most other RPG's. The game is far from linear. And you can either kill anybody you want.. or be their errand boy/girl.   Recommend vs not recommend is not really fair.. I am not condemning the game. But at a purchase price of 45 USD, with the poor support you receive from Larian Studios.. your better off waiting on huge sale to purchase this game."

95,DD,64,9,2,2018-03-15,Not Recommended,426.7,"i played the former title, DOS EE for 570 hours in a row. That is the most enjoyable RPG i've ever played.  i started this DOS2 with very high expectation, but i'm dissapointed.  XP income is very restricted while you deaperately need appropriate level to win the battle. if you are underleveled, you can't kill just one enemy(not Boss) with your full four members in one round, while single enemy character(not Boss,again) easily kill your member in just one round. OK,OK, i know creative strategy and smart use of skills are needed to win the battle in this game. But it's almost impossible when you are underleveled in the first place.  My memorable first play stopped at the forced, scripted battle between 1st and 2nd chapter.i had to abandon the Save. In second play, i had to gather all the XPs available to win the coming forced battle.  i had to kill even the daramatically rescued NPCs after i get their thanks and quest XP rewards... when i left the first island, 80% of the population became corpse for my survival at the unavoidable battle. This is XP hunting slaughter, not role playing game...  Combat system is a total failure, i think. There're so many complicated debuff skills and terrain control skills, but NONE OF THEM WORKS AS LONG AS ENEMY HAS ARMOUR. And when you reduce their armour to zero, IT'S MUCH FASTER DIRECTLY ATTACK THEIR HP THAN WASTING YOUR ACTION FOR DEBUFFING.  There're so many skills and spells, but in combat all you have to do is same. Always attack with highest damage -expectable way.  In DOS EE, all combat are never the same depending on what tactics you selected. But in DOS2, all combat looks the same while selectable choices are too many. Far less enjoyable than the former title. For example, is there any meaning for two types of fire(normal and cursed) exists? While most enemy gets no damage with armour or elegantly teleport or fly to avoid them?  Many bugs still remain. You can recruit many NPCs to your mother ship for utility, but some of them never moves to your ship, just dissapear(fletcher and the salvaging boy ,for example)  Companion quest system is also annoying. When i talk to quest-related NPCs, companion A interrups to conversation and kill the NPC, so companion B's quest stops and can't be finished.(Sebile is the worst.she spoils the red lizard and Ifan's quests) Yes,it's avoidable through the dialogue IF YOU KNOW IT HAPPEN. Of course I didn't know it in my first play, so i had to abandone my play and load the data.What do you call it but annoying?  Crafting system is garbage. Don't bother to pick up and carry materials for crafting. You never use them. In DOS EE, crafted weapons are overpowered, i admit. But in DOS2, crafting has almost no purpose and meaning.Why goes extreme to extreme?  90% of the people in DOS2 prefer blunt weapons. You can get only hammer, mace, axes for your two-handed weapon expert. If you luckily find some, they are far too weaker than blunts. I WANT TO USE TWO-HANDED SWORD! WHY NOBODY SELLS THEM?  i hope DOS3 will be more evaluated and well-balanced one.  Oh, lastly to the players who has interest to this game via youtube or any oher movies. MOST OF THE FEATS INTRODUCED IN THEM OR WIKI NEVER AVAILABLE. Seems latest patch killed these super-play."

The first two acts are really fun- And then the third drops the ball so hard it deflates. I really, really want to love this game, but the truth is, there is a LOT of work still to be done. All the villains the game spends forever talking up are shallow and without any payoff- you hit them, they die, the end.   I could go in to greater detail here, but the most important fact I want to get across is I think this stuff can be fixed- with any luck, some extended addition will make the 3rd act playable, and let custom characters actully not miss out on chunks of the game.

Update after spending 70 hours in single player:  At some point around the 50 hour mark, the game started to give me errors while saving, though it would still save the game anyway. After that, my profile bugged out. Every time I booted the game, my profile name changed to Debug_Player_Profile_1 and the original profile was gone. The folder was still there, though. Copying saves to a new profile didn't work, and neither did the other solutions suggested in the Larian forums and Steam forums. The only solution I found was to back up my saves, wipe out the profile folder and make a new profile with the same name as the original, which the game suddenly recognized in the cloud and gave me my saves back. I managed to play for a few hours after that, but this morning there were no saves in the cloud anymore and the debug profile was back.   TLDR Broken game, stay away"

I realized this when I noticed it again in my library today and came to the conclusion that I probably would never finish it.  I quite like this game actually. It promises rich story and narrative directed by player choice and obviously falls flat just like every game that promises such, but I could have gotten past it. Obviously a game can't have total freedom, and to its credit, Divinity Original Sin 2 has more freedom than most RPGs in several ways that can create some good fun.  The combat is nice too, turn based so slow at times, but with an emphasis on the planning and spatial strategy which compliment the lack of intensity. Battles must be won with careful tactics and preparation as well as using the current status of the environment to your advantage. A rain spell can make the ground wet, a contamination spell can poison the water, any fire spell can ignite the poison, another rain spell can turn the fire into concealing steam clouds, a lightning spell can electrify the clouds, etc.  Mechanically the game is alright, though not above bouts of occasional ???????t when targeting and pathing and line of sight are concerned, but the narrative elements left me cold. Dialogue is a bit too ham for my taste and quality of writing is a few rungs lower than what I'd call acceptable, and it still ultimately trips over itself by promising too much freedom. By mimicking the style of tabletop as hard as it does it only shoots itself in the foot repeatedly when I keep thinking of things I ought to be able to do but the game engine won't let me.   A few examples jump to mind as particularly galling; near the start of the game a Bad Guy argues with a lady at the city gate and they give some exposition before the Bad Guy kills the lady and then leaves. It's possible to get into the town another way so the event doesn't trigger, and they stand there at the gate arguing basically forever until you come back. So it's possible to come back at a higher level once you've learned the spell that lets you teleport other people around. My first thought was to teleport the lady away so that the Bad Guy can't kill her, but the Bad Guy's attack apparently has infinite range, goes through walls, and doesn't require line of sight. One might suppose ""oh but clearly you're using an exploit if you get around this scripted event and try to come back to it later when you have a spell you shouldn't have."" But you'd be wrong, because it's possible to defeat the Bad Guy right there and she has dialogue for it and drops her super powered hammer, so obviously the designers intentionally made this possible but didn't think I'd try to save the doomed NPC.  I could list others, but really this isn't that big of a deal. For every time my friends and I got to say ""Man, they really should let us do this thing"" there were a good one or two times we got to say ""Boy I'm so glad they actually let us do this thing."" No, what made me put the game down was at the end of the first major chapter when I had the distinct displeasure of meeting Malady, an arrogant, boring, snotty and smug insufferable and invincible DMPC so obnoxious and poorly written that after being forced to spend the next hour of the game with her I could no longer bring myself to care what happens next in this story or to this world or to any of these other characters.   Every pretense the game had to offering me freedom was immediately shoved aside so the author's pet character could have the spotlight instead. An insurmountable problem appears (which I was well on my way to resolving on my own) and she insists we retreat because there's no way YOU could beat this enemy you silly little peasant, and I can't tell her to??????off and let me win this fight without her, she teleports us away and I can't call her out on it. She constantly acts completely bored with my saving the world from annihilation, she rubs it in my face how mysterious and wise she is like she has all the answers but won't tell me any of them, and if I even try to refuse to talk to her, she basically mind controls me into telling her what she wants to know. And of course, when I attack her, she just shrugs it off, turns invisible (preventing me from talking to her for a minute or two until she comes back, which stalls the game because talking to her is literally the only way to advance), and says ""Please, just don't"" like my attack that took off a third of her health in one hit somehow only bothered her as much as if I were a four year old kicking her in the back of the leg because obviously she's just so cool you guys. No other character has been invincible up to that point; you can kill shopkeepers, guards, random civilians, even the NPCs you can get to join your party if you talk to them, everybody you meet except for the children, which, fine, whatever, people get pissy if you let players kill children in your game I guess.  So naturally I immediately saved and quit and went to look up how to kill her and it looks like you can but only in a story cutscene somewhere so it's still on the author's terms and leads to a bad ending or something, and keeping her alive and talking to her a whole lot seems to be the only way to stop one of the recruitable NPCs who I kind of liked from dying later. Or something. I don't know the details of course, and I no longer care. I have the impression she would only get worse, and my involvement in the story would only decline as she took more and more center stage, because that's the kind of character she is, and even if I'm wrong about this it's already too late. Malady was such an awful and offensively trite character that she broke the spell, and my trust in the author is gone.  If you're some kind of deranged mutant who would like to explain to me why Malady is your waifu and are presumably someone who's never played Dungeons and Dragons with a crappy DM so you don't know how to spot one and haven't had the chance to ever feel that particular brand of hate and impotence, feel free to leave a comment and I will not read it."

If you love story driven rpgs where the world you roam gives you adventure at every turn - this game is for you.   Positives: The myraid of ways you can build a character. I opted for more of a ""Warden"" route and enjoyed the freedom of veering outside of the confines of the usually locked in advancement systems found elsewhere.  The NPCs and their contribution to nearly every scene as well as their own storylines. I will admit I got a mod to allow me to take all of them along. Not so that the game would be easier but rather so I could experience all of their storylines in one playthrough. I was not disappointed. Best character development I have seen in an rpg in a long long time.  How big and developed the world is. Nearly every corner has you encountering some mystery, npc, adventure, or clue. Sometimes it can even be a little overwhelming but with time and effort - you can start mapping out everything.  The combat system. The built upon the previous one and improved its flaws. In the original, I would grenade and area effect arrow the hell out of everything. Sometimes allowed me to breeze through fights that should have required strategy. This time out - there isn't any overt easy tactics. In quite a few fights, you have to bring your strategy A game or die repeatedly.  Negatives Some of the puzzles got too clever for themselves and go well outside of the established routines of how to solve them. While in some cases this worked well, there are quite a few that gave you no starting reference point of how to even begin to solve them. This can lead to quite a bit of frustration and then gets compounded with the occasional bug that pretty much leads to a roll back save to try a different approach just to avoid the bug.   Endings. Big fan of anime here so I understand the idea of endings that aren't exactly clean but damn... the one that takes care of the most things literally nullifies the entire purpose of the game.   I NEED some Malady DLC!   In any event, highly recommend this game. One of the best I have ever played.   "

First turn-based RPG I've played and each fight was really interesting, a bit like chess because you had to carefully use your turns or the game would kick your sweet patootie.  The biggest weakness for me was the game didn't seem to keep up with the changing context eg you may have completed a mission in a particular way and characters in the game would still be talking to you about it as if you hadn't done it yet.  This is probably because the game provides so much freedom that the devs couldn't possibly predict what every player might choose in every instance.  The final fight was a bit of a fizzer - I befriended the main villains so that they helped me fight the prime villain - so that ended him relatively quickly and then it was pretty much over - I didn't even have to kill the rest of them.  I don't really get the name of the game - the divnity bit is obvious but what was the original sin?  And how was this different from the first game which I didn't play?"

170,Herakilla,460,13,8,2018-03-30,Not Recommended,61.1,"I loved the first game and played that multiple times as well as the enhanced edition.  This game starts out great.  The changes they made to almost all of the core mechanics are awesome.  But these changes have some serious side effects.  The AI is essentially too smart is what it all boils down to.  For example. there is no point in having a tank in your party because every class has multiple teleports available to it so your tank just gets ignored.  They have a lot of armor and health but what good is that if the AI just completely ignores them and uses teleports to go after your healer and damage dealers. You might think you can defeat this with superior tactics but there are just so many teleports you really can't put the AI in a position where it is forced to attack your tank.  On top of that the AI gets much faster cooldowns on the same spells that you have.  Your ability to knock down a target will have a 3-4 turn cooldown.  That exact same ability in the hands of the AI has a 1 turn cooldown so it can be used every single turn allowing the AI to put your party members in stun locks very often.  Good luck if you run out of either physical or magical armor.  And to make matters even worse the game has horrific loading times and still suffers multiplayer connection issues.  Expect to spend at least 5 minutes just loading your save.  Then your friends have to spend at least the same amount of time loading when they connect to you.  Saving takes at least half a minute most of the time even on a good machine.  And party members get timed out very often which requires them to once again go through the long loading process when they reconnect.  Very frustrating to deal with.  Putting the game on an SSD doesn't seem to help very much which is embarassing.  There are a lot of small issues that add up to a tedious experience as well.  Persuasion system is a step back from the first game (and I wasn't the biggest fan of that either) due to cost of the stat.  There are many times when a quest or objective is completed but only one member in the party has knowledge of that fact even though all of the characters were present and involved every step of the way, rather immersion breaking.  The magic pockets feature is extremely picky and doesn't seem to work with quest items and even some keys.  The AI always has an abundance of action points enabling them to take 3+ attacks during their turns even after moving.  The world itself isn't designed well enough to guide the players on a linear path even though if you try to go outside the path you should be following you will get murdered."

72,Nogan,125,24,2,2018-04-02,Not Recommended,46.2,"I kept hearing this game being touted as the best RPG ever made, so I checked it out. Not to say that it's a bad game, because IT ISN'T, but I was disappointed. Seems that it was described that way by the sorts of people whose favorite aspect of ""RPGs"" is discovering new builds and squeezing the best possible numbers out of them. It actually functions very similarly to Skryrim in that way, as it exists as a sort of sandbox for players to experiment with builds while ignoring the story until they get bored and try a different one.  If you're looking for a game with a compelling story, I don't think you'll find it here. It's pretty forgettable and was obviously thrown in as an afterthought. Again, this is the sort of RPG built for metagamers. In the sake of allowing that openness, you aren't hampered in your endeavors by anything but the level of the enemies you encounter. For instance, Fort Joy is described as a ghetto where you're kept under thumb by a group of militant radicals, where the prisoners have set up their own gangs and attempt to run things under the radar. But you're never accosted by your jailors. You're never confronted by Gangs of New York inspired Griff. You just do your own thing and run around the fort like you own the place. It never imparts the sense of genuine strife.  If you're looking for a game with tight tactical combat, I don't think you'll find it here, either. Combat is turn based and off grid. Means characters have very little physical presence and everyone can just squeeze by each other. Also means that there's no real advantage to be gained from positioning. AoE spells fall where they may because everyone is rooted to the ground while its someone else's turn, and there aren't any good methods of herding or aggroing enemies to keep them still while your mage rains down powerful spells.  Speaking of spells, class abilities are pretty homogenized, so everybody gets powerful recovery, AoE, mobility, and debuffing options. Class identity has been sacrificed in the name of customization, which I'm sure many find appealing, though I personally find it detracts from the meat of the gameplay.  The last issues I have rest with itemization. All the equipment you find is based on item level, which is based on character level. The difference between items one level apart is significant. Equipment two or more levels below the current level of your character might as well not even exist. The damage you do and the damage you can take is almost entirely based on item level. It means that any equipment you find is going to be rendered useless in about an hour, which is frustrating. And more than that, the problem lies with ARMOR.  Armor is, by far, the single biggest issue with combat and levels in this game. Armor effectively stops characters from being effected by any number of the overpowered statuses. It stacks up and goes down like health as you do/take damage. Once you're armorless, you're defenseless against them. So why is this an issue? The amount of armor you can stack is heavily tied to the level of armor you're using. Because the level of armor the enemies use is tied to their level, it means that character level is the most important factor in deciding where you can go and what you can do. There's no cheating out unlikely victories against higher level encounters, because you have to smack each other until the armor goes away before you can actually influence combat in any reasonable way. This effectively means that the game holds your hand as it walks you to from encounter to encounter that you're currently allowed to beat. No strategy. No tactics. Just numbers.  All in all, it wasn't the sort of RPG that I was looking for. I don't think most of these points are negatives so much as they're descriptions of what to expect. The strategy you'll find in this game is derived from how you feel like building your character, rather than in the encounters themselves. Basically, it's ""do I want to make a stealth archer or tanky mage"" rather than ""there are multiple archers across that gap, how do I want to tackle this particular encounter"". I don't personally enjoy RPGs like that, so I didn't find a lot here that I cared for."

Ispecialy sence every thing has a teleport ability of some design, they will jump to them or jump away to much that your tank will be unable to do a damn thing.

That certainly goes to show something about the amount of content in this game, considering how many hours I've already played this game for. So far, I have a good grasp on what this game is like, so I'll give you a list of the good and bad.  Pros: Lots of content You have the option to do what quests you want to Quests have multiple ways of doing them Insane freedom is given in this game which I think RPGs tend to be lacking in (for story choices) Difficult fights that give a sense of achievement Variety of fights (no 2 fights are the same) The story Dialogue is all voice acted. Voice lines sound like there was a lot of thought put into each one. Dialogue for animals when you have pet pal This game achieves having a serious tone while having humor at the same time Descriptions for items are hilarious (ex. dismembered foot, ""All five toes, check! An attacked leg, Uhhhh..."" or when you click on a globe the narrator says, ""And you thought Rivellon was flat"") Insignificant NPCs still have voice lines, which really improves the immersion into the game You can steal whatever you want and kill whoever you want, however, there is an attitude system that punishes you for that Origin Characters in the game have interesting back stories The game allows you to have a romance with all the origin characters, including a ????ing skeleton, no more needs to be said. There are no traditional classes you are stuck to. You can mix and match whatever spells you want. For example, you could try going double shields with no weapon, and the spell ""shield throw."" I don't know why you would want to do it, but its possible The game is begging to be replayed with all the different builds on characters, origin character stories, and the ridiculous amount of choices you can make. The game has a tag system where your character earns tags through their actions, which gives you more dialogue options, and determines how npcs react to you. Elemental surfaces in combat are a very fun mechanic to work with. Races you pick in this game (Dwarf, Elf, Lizard, Human, and all the undead versions) all have unique abilities and tags unique to the races.  Cons: You can be thrown into a fight you don't expect (which can be also a pro depending on how you see it) Sometimes areas are high level to discourage you from going into them yet. This can get confusing when you don't know that there is another area with lower level enemies. You will use google at some point during this game. Some puzzles/ quests can be very difficult to figure out how to complete. Quicksave often, sometimes you might accidentally steal an item you didn't mean to if you click the wrong thing when moving. Devs, please just remove taunt entirely or change it. It's only one fight in the entire game so far that I've had to deal with this, but watching my character taken over by ai for a turn or two and using every scroll and source ability in my inventory is not an enjoyable game mechanic. Especially since it now pierces armor.  Overall, this is a great game that I would encourage you to give a try. It has some negatives, but they are definitely worth dealing with for the insane amount of positives the game has. The game has really good devs who seem to want to deliver a quality product, which they have. Out of all the RPGs I've tried, this is the best in my opinion."

Stat system with unique contributes to character design? Mucked up somehow by cheap builds and a dozen bad-build pit traps.  Relatively one-of-a-kind terrain manipulation? Almost all mid/end-game fights end up in one giant pool of cursed necrofire.  Everyone loves crafting systems! ..what am I saying? No one loves crafting systems, and this one ought been aborted at conception.  Level scaling is pretty awful. Very little difference in gear from 1-5, but by 14+, you want to repurchase all your gear every level.  Plenty of skills to go around and mesh and make weird combos. ..with too-long cooldowns and a Memory requirement that eats up half your stat allocation. Civil abilities that are damn near required to find quests don't come quickly enough. Talents are spiffy, but sparse and not applicable to some builds.  Loved the voiceover work. That's a plus. Shame about the WORLD THAT DESPERATELY WANTS TO DIE and is awash in /r/14anddeep moral greyness that presents the worst people being required to do quests for to get xp.   It started off so interesting, but fell flat. My recommendation, if you get this game, is to use the tools and editor to make adventures of your own, skills of your own, and have fun with it that way.

25,Nameless Voice,262,84,8,2018-04-07,Not Recommended,152.4,"Great worldbuilding, writing and attention to detail marred by bad and often frustrating game mechanics and poor design decisions.  I really enjoyed the first Divinity: Original Sin, so when the Kickstarter for this one came around, I backed it, expecting the game to be more of the same, but better. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out like that. Some apsects of the game are certainly improved over the previous one, but other areas feel like a step backwards instead.  Worldbuilding As we've come to expect from Larian games, it's clear that a lot of love went into crafting the world of Divinity: Original Sin 2. It is packed with small details; hidden corners, small side-quests, interesting NPCs, readables, and item descriptions. They also thought of almost everything, with the game often reacting to and acknowledging unusual or unexpected behaviours (such as defeating an enemy who is expected to be unbeatable at that point.)  The quests are usually well-written and the companion characters each have their own distinct personality and unique storyline, which adds a lot of depth to the game. The main story also has good writing, though the plot itself is a bit meandering and, without giving too much away, most of the game's endings don't really resolve many plot threads.  Mechanics Unfortunately, where Divinity: Original Sin 2 really starts to come apart is in its mechanics, and especially in the changes made to its mechanics since the original game.  Armour The main problem comes from the introduction of the new armour and status effect system. Every character has a value for physical and magical armour, which can be damaged by attacks of the appropriate type, and are generally immune to most status effects while their armour holds (with magical armour blocking magical-based statuses, such as Stunned, and physical armour blocking physical-bases statuses, such as Knocked Down.)  This does a number of things.  First of all, because attacks of one type do not affect the armour of the other type, the most effective party composition is one where all of the charaters deal the same type of damage. For example, if you have three physical and one magical damage dealer, then the mage will very often feel useless because she has to wear down the enemies' magical armour by herself before she is even able to deal any damage, while the three physical characters can help each other knock down their opponents' physical armour. She probably won't even bother attacking enemies because by the time she has worn through their magic armour on her own, her allies will probably have killed them already. That leaves the mage mostly relegated to a support / buff role.  Second, the fact that most elemental effects are blocked by magic armour relegates the first first game's unique elemental system to a much more minor role. Surfaces are mostly meaningless against enemies because they won't break through their magic armour, and the combination of elemental effects (such as water + lightning to stun) are also far less prominent when the game is all about breaking down opponents' armour.  Third, enemies tend to have a lot more armour than player characters (even more so on Tactician difficulty, which mostly just turns enemies into damage sponges), so that means that your team will be struggling to get through the enemy armour in order to apply some of your skills to them, while they will easy burn through your armour and apply their negative effects to you.  ItemsAnother problem is the item system. Items gain stats as you level up, and the rate of difference becomes exponential at later levels, so you have to constantly swap out your items for new ones to stay relevant, while  the randomly-selected item stats make it very hard to find a really good item even when it is the right level. You spend a lot of time comparing item statistics and swapping out loot, made more awkward by the fact that any items sold to merchants are randomly mixed in with their new items, making it almost impossible to find good items from anyone you've sold items to. By the final chapter, the stat escalation has become ridiculous, and for some reason the merchants don't even have much stock, so you'll almost never even find any decent items for sale.  You also can't get around the problem by using crafting, since the crafting system in DOS2 has been completely gutted. You can only craft the most basic of weapons, can no longer craft magic items, and can no longer upgrade your items throgh crafting (other than by using one fairly rare late-game item). For the most part, crafting is only useful for creating skill books, spell scrolls, and potions.  SkillsOn the plus side, the skill trees in DOS2 are very well crafted, with each having a plethora of unique and interesting skills in it.  You can play a viable character by specialising in any one (or mix) of those skill trees - though you are somewhat limited in your choice by the armour system and the desire to have only one damage type in your party.  Your characters can no longer use every skill that they know automatically - instead, they can only use skills which are memorised, and the number of spells that can be memorised at once is based on the new Memory stat. This helps prevent that problem in DOS1 where a character had multiple skillbars all full of different skills. There are also fewer skills which are very similar to each other.  The game also introduces Source Points. These are rare points that allow you to use powerful Source skills. Your characters all start off with 1 maximum source point, and can get up to 3 during the course of the story.  Because Source points are rare, especially in the earlier parts of the game (and the main method of acquiring them is kind of evil), they often feel ""too valuable to use"". The game introduces new ""blessed"" and ""cursed"" statuses, which affect surfaces in interesting ways (such as blessed water surfaces healing people standing on them.) Bless and curse also cancel each other out. Your characters gain the ability to bless surfaces fairly early on, but it uses a Source Point, making it incredibly costly to use. The enemy, on the other hand, have no shortage of Curse spells, which lead to two of the most annoying effects in the game - cursed blood (which is extremely common, as one of the most common enemy type bleeds it) makes anyone standing on it take damage from healing, and cursed ice surfaces have a random % chance of freezing anyone who walks over them.  What this means is that you are often fighting in frustrating combat situations where you either don't have access to some of your abilities (healing), or where you can randomly lose fights because of a % chance of being frozen solid. You can use Bless to remove these cursed surfaces, but that costs a rare Source point, and the enemy can often just cast more Curses (or just bleed cursed blood) to negate your use of that costly spell.  The most powerful skills in each tree are Source skills, which cost source points, and use 2 or 3 points of memory, so not only are they extremely expensive to cast, they also take up as much Memory as multiple other skills. This makes getting the highest skills in each tree extremely disappointing because you almost never get to use them and are probably better off not even bothering to memorise them and to instead use the slots for basic skills.  Overall the Source point system just makes any abilities that require it annoyingly costly to use, effectively removing some of your options for no particularly good reason, and doesn't really provide anything interesting or positive to the gameplay.  ConclusionDivinity: Original Sin 2 certainly isn't a bad game, but it's still disappointing compared to the first game. If you are on the fence about it, I would recommend waiting for further patches or an enhanced edition to hopefully fix some of its myriad flaws."

169,mattboesen,236,5,1,2018-04-09,Not Recommended,146.9,"A great game.  Visually stunning, RPG fabulous, plot and thinking excellent.  Except, the devs still haven't learned some basic 'niceties' of gameplay.  Take a look at...any other game of this turn-based AP genre, and you won't find a single one of these problems.  Graphics 9/10 Story and Lore 10/10 Character Complexity 9/10 Gameplay 1/10 Combat Rules 1/10  1. Don't let me shoot into the floor.  Stop me.  Don't make me waste the AP.  This is simple stuff guys.  Yes, I can see that it says my LOS is blocked, but then why allow me to click?  You've trapped the error, now do something with it for darn sake. 2. Why does line of sight NOT work for bad guys?  They have no line of sight rules at all.  Shoot through a floor, a rock, a ceiling, a wall, no problems.  Reciprocal line of sight is ignored, and enemies have no penalty for low height apparently.  The algorithm clearly has a trap in it that says ""ignore the LOS step if it is AI targetting player'.  This is a design choice you have consciously made.  This is an admission of guilt by the devs that they couldnt get it right in gameplay instead. 3. Don't make my toons walk through stuff on the floor if they can get around it easily.  Make it easy for me to avoid.  The most common path in this game appears to start with ""Make a u-turn at Alberquerque and folloow the Basingstoke Roundabout"". This, too, is simple stuff guys.  Oh, but the enemies avoid it, so there is sensible pathing programmed into the game.  So why the hell can't I use the same pathfinding algorithm?  Oh yeah, reasons. 4. In trade, let me sell stuff off differnt guys.  Don't make me move it all into one inventory first.  Simple improvement in quality of life for me.  You will spend an extraordinary quantity of time just screwing around with bags in this game for ... reasons. 5. Yes, I am covered in oil and slowed.  No, it is totally unecessary to make my toon walk like a cripple.  I get it.  He's slow.  Now hurry the hell up and let me play.  Sigh... 6. I hide my Rogue.  The combat starts.  My rogue goes last.  So much for 'sneak' attack.  Its alsmost like smart tactics lead to dumb results according to the rules they apply.  If you are keen to have innovative tactics, maybe make them rewarding. 7. Height line of sight is totally nuts.  There are places that can see everything, and be attacked from nowhere, but only if you are an AI.  For no reason at all.  In the Fort Joy arena, yes, the enemy platform is totally invulnerable, since I cannot see the floor even if it were in range.  That's just garbage.  Oh, and when I am there, I can see...well...pretty much nowhere. 8. Hiding behind a wall, on the other side of the battlefield - no problems!  Enemy will suddenly have one hundred AP to walk on over and kill you.  Don't worry, not a bug at all.  Nice, fair, even combat, with sensible rules.  I've seen toons walk thirty metres and then use two abilities, even though they used all their AP the turn before. 8. Basic bugs - ""Blinded was removed by Clear Minded"" followed immediately by being unable to shoot because I am Blinded.  Hahahahahahahahahaha. Ox dung. 9. Enemy uses four two-AP abilities in a turn, and moves as well.  Yeah...umm...say what?  There are simply so many things in the turn-based part of this game which are pointlessly tedious, and so many things that should have been found in playtest, that I wonder if about half of the gameplay is you fighting the interface and stupidity of the toons, or the devs themselves.  Yes, this is a game where you fight everyone but the enemy at times.  The rest of the game, still absolutely awesome.  The lore and concepts are great, the maps are fantastic, the humour even has some bite.  But the gameplay niceties are totally missing.  Just like last time around.  This is the same kludge of rubbish, clothed in a pretty suit."

I have 150 hours in game and that's just one playthrough with Fane on a tactician difficulty while trying my best to complete everything, discover all quests, secrets, achievements and locations.   I have started playing on release and finished the game on the latest patch and i can say that it remains one of the most bug ridden games i have ever encountered on par with Fallout and Elder Scrolls.   In every act there are numerous quests which do no close or register upon completion correctly. There are broken npc's which do not progress quests correctly or even board your ship when they supposed to. Broken items which do no have any description or can't be used or have broken interactions. Broken achievements. Missing sounds and dialogues. Dead npc's reappearing later on or being addressed is if they are alive or alive npc's appearing dead. Bugged, broken, missing, wrong - that's the current state of the game. Even one of the endings for Fane was broken which is simply unacceptable and should be the very least that they could've fixed by now. Not to mention chat which never worked since the release.    What's even worse is that every bug has been documented both on larian and steam forums, there are threads upon threads detailing and repeating almost all of the bugs i have encountered in the game and some of the threads are from 2016 and 2017.   While the game has amazing graphics, music, good story, a lot of choices, puzzles and genuinely addictive gameplay - the lack of QA is truly astonishing.   I realize that partially it's my own fault since im a completionist and prefer to explore every nook and cranny and up until the ending i was still going to write a positive review but when i was unable to use the ending that i wanted all along i decided that it was enough.

This is a good game with a bad UI (mouse and keyboard, or controller) that needs some help that mods can't seem to provide, and a structure that is perfectly opaque and relies on savescumming or wikis to push forward an inch at a time.  First the good: Once you understand combat, the game really opens up. Guides on character builds made this work for me. Once I let go of the urge to play without knowing anything, and bookmarked the wikis, I began to really enjoy myself. I got several hours in and I intended to keep playing. The atmosphere is solid. The voice acting is genuinely good. Big surprise! They spent real energy on building the world.  Then the standard: Game mechanics are fairly convoluted. Unwinnable fights await you in random areas that are apparently ""next"", so save scumming is a must. Without internet guidance, you might foolishly believe that a bad weapon is good. Some of this convolution gives way to depth as you learn and read online guides, but some remains. The leveling system is pretty cool, and the character build variety can make for a very interesting party. Although it seems unanimously true that a Lone Wolf is the best way to guarantee your victory, I think you would lose out a lot on the game, since the character interactions are pretty cool.  Finally, the interest-killingly bad: It takes more clicks than you can imagine just to sell all the junk in your inventory to a blacksmith. A blacksmith who wanders around her shop endlessly, and in trying to talk to her, you'll inadvertently steal her pliers, because they're the same button, which will cause her to dislike you permanently. I hope you saved before trying to talk to the blacksmith! Traveling around even on the first island takes a long time, and there is no real guidance. Once I scummed my way through the first boss and got to the second area, I realized this was going to be a pattern. I was tired of it immediately. Then I got into about 20 no-warning fights, where I effectively watched a cinematic of enemies popping into existence from somewhere, getting first initiative, and murdering my entire party in a single turn, and I completely lost interest. I don't think it should be my job to magically know where I can safely go next.  I hope development continues for this game. There's a lot of potential. Although this is the kind of game where spending your money on it makes the gaming ecosystem stronger, and it has a lot of truly unique strengths, I still can't recommend it."

The biggest issue with this system is you can't explore certain areas that you would like to go to or have a quest in that location because there is 4 or 5 enemies that are 1 level higher than you. That doesn't seem bad but the levels in this game are brutal. If you and your group are just 1 level below the enemy then the fights are near impossible. You also can't just go past the enemies because you are forced to fight, as soon as the enemy sees you. You are not able to run past them and the most you can do is walk away a certain distance and teleport to the nearest waypoint and when you go back you will still have to fight the enemies in that area but they start with all of their health. The fighting itself is very boring,when you and your group start a battle to actually hurt them you need to destroy their magic or physical armor or both, spending on what attacks you plan to use.

Excellence in story craft like this happens once a generation, so don't miss it. Also, whatever you do, DO NOT go for spoilers of any kind. Just take some time off work and play this game... trust me.  The only danger here is that after I finished the game, I kinda feel like I'm done with gaming.

It plays like a classic RPG with turn based combat, action economy, skills, spells, multiple ways to build your characters, even multi classing and having it have drop in drop out 4 player cooperative is a very nice feature, can even be modded to have larger parties though you will unbalance the game for yourself and disable achievements. The in game lore and stories play well from one arc to the next and the scenes in which they are set are beautiful.  My only complaints about this game would be the lack of interesting none human player races, though the lizard folk are really nicely designed.  The fact you can move far enough away from active combat (sometimes) to leave combat and thus get infinite and free action economy whilst the rest of your team is playing turn by turn."

483,Paddy Mayne,85,3,2,2018-04-26,Not Recommended,126,"Don't be beguiled by the large number of positive reviews! While there is a lot to admire about the size, content and look of the game the fundimentals are a mess and ridiculously unbalanced against the player. Forget thinking you have found a great new piece of armor or a splendid weapon that's perfect for you character, before long at least by the next level up it will be a vulnerability, stats too low yet barely worth selling. Every fight you are the underdog. Enemies, be they simple slugs to ghastly demons are vastly more powerful than you. It gets worse and worse as you move through the game as there is little consistency (in scale or the self contained universe) to the abilities and stats of enemy groups. There are few chances to adapt or plan unless you save every 10 seconds and replay every encounter over and over until maybe on some occasions you get a break. More and more its a case of flee or reload and avoid. My last encounter before I quit and wrote this review in utter frustration 2 of my party died in the first attack before I even got to have a turn. <Update just had a ONE hit party wipe out by goodness! ...whhhhaaaattt!> A fair and full review would need to be vastly longer than any here allows but in my personal opinion have now tried DOS 1 and 2 you best be aware its NOT D&D, its not Baulders Gate or Neverwinter or anything like.  You will quickly wonder why its goes from slow and ponderous especially in the first chapters of both games, to frequent gob-smacked rage in frustration at the perfidious onesided, almost solely armor based combat.  For a confused narrative very partially about stopping the use of magic its ironic even a slug knows more ridiculously wide-ranging spells than your party.  Occasionally my wannabe 'Gods' seemed to have powers to match their status. They could sometimes fight on an 'near' even basis, their stats miracoulsly creeping up to 'HALF' their opponents and given my careful planning and assessment. But then that was when I back-tracked to areas long by-passed or completed narrative-wise.   My advice: Only buy at a huge mark down, like 70%, or if you are a pedantic soul who spends hours studying stats and comparisions by your own work or using the (for this game) poor wikis and on line sources. Thats just me and I am in a minority.  Just try to be aware of what you are in for, the out pourings of admiration are I believe a product as much about the general state of PC gaming. I have bought it and will try hard to enjoy and play as much as I can, I don't like to waste money after all. It can be enjoyable and interesting and engaging but would I get my money back if I could ?... yes for both Divinity OS 1 and 2 and I wouldn't lie awake regretting it.  I am not a big fan of games that require you very often to leave the immersion to seek outside help with beating a game. To have work out what deals with a particular fundimental game mechanic with rarely any in game hints or advice sources.  Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen was an exception I enjoyed despite that.  DOS2 though I haven't bothered researching help much, it just doesn't seem worth the bother."

That is until I reached the Reaper's Coast. The difficulty spike is ????ing massive. I'm not talking about a little, I mean almost everywhere is a giant boss monster that can literally one shot your team with ease. The only method of killing them is to cheese them like throwing dozens of fire bombs to prevent regeneration, talking to them, then teleporting them to an extremely overpowered friendly NPC, survive waves of enemies so the portals finally dissapear while a character literally pours instant KO lava onto your characters, or somehow killing 6 wolves that give the already massive enemy a buff that increases almost every stat on almost every turn they get.   I grinded, and grinded, and grinded. I rebuilt my characters, I even got better gear, but these fights only introduce rage. As a Lone Wolf character, all these fights were impossible, since I could only have a max of two characters, including my own. I've gone through this game thus far using my wits, and patience. I've won fights that I was actually too low for, and even underequipped because I built my characters right. These fights threw all those under the bridge, it felt like all the time I've spent crafting them has gone to waste because of how ???????t they are."
771,Deebzy,69,No,0,2018-04-27,Not Recommended,17.4,"Serioues issues with the game, namely map bugs and quest updates. Stuck in fort joy and have done a bunch of side quests to ""Show me the way out of fort joy"" and my map has updated with zero, 0, nada way points or PoIs that show any story progession. Looked into it and basically had to resort to youtube and walk throughs in order to find things out which isnt what I paid for. Early combat is heavily squed to the side of the game and difficulty isnt really shifted in the right way imo. The main thing that was annoying was that the difficulty mod was a hard lesson as the intro level on the ship is long and boring after the first time you play through it.  I also have some heavy critisism for the enrionmental aspects of the combats. I understand that the creators were trying to have a heavy focus on positioning and AoE aspects of the game but litterally every fight has some kind of zone or area that will suddenly make the battle one sided, even oil throwing crocks for some odd reason that will ignite a torch nearby and nuke half the screen. Like I get it, you wanted something more than hack and slash and you wanted a cool new aspect to the rpg experience but every single freaking fight doesnt have to have archers shooting firebombs or fire cocktails or poison containers.   Camera controls are ???? and need a serious overhaul imo too. you can spin but there is no pitch and in order to see half the time i feel like i had to blind click into areas. Gets real annoying real fast especially compared to other games and in engines and other systems where pitch controls are included in a top down rpg setting. All in all Id say like a solid 4/10 needs some work and not worth 40$, glad i waited on buying it."
129,Dobermann,595,No,0,2018-04-28,Not Recommended,126.4,"Big fan of the first Original Sin. Had a lot of fun playing it through with two pads and split screen with a friend. This review is meant for fans of the first one and are looking more of the same. For those without Original Sin experience I can say I wouldn't recommend this game as a first Original Sin game.  So what has changed? Archery has been improved and is usefull in the beginning already. You have access to many skills that allow you to move full spell range from your enemies without any opportunity attacks to block you. Saddly, so has most of the enemy also. So you and your advesaries jump around a lot more than in the first one.  You have two different types of armor, physical and magical. Physical armor is meant to be removed before you are able to get health damage and extra effects like knockdown throuh. Same with magical armor and spell effects, just using different bar. This means you should use different damage on different enemies. It isn't challenging as much it is limiting.  A lot more different skills. Most of you won't be using at all. Not because they have far more useful counterparts, but also because you are introduced a memory slot system that only lets you learn a limited number of skills/spells. These can be changed out of battle, so with save/load scoutiing you can set them optimal before fight. So, not challenging, just limiting.  With creative usage of foliage and height differences your surroundings are much more lively than in the first one. Sadly I also found them more difficult to understand. Height differences should create tactical opportunities but they are lost because everyone jump around. Don't worry, the indicator is still the same white spot that you can't find in fiery surroundings.  You can't choose your fights as ambushes are used a lot. With save/load scouting and using indestructible foot high carpet rolls as barricades you might be able to capture a hint of the first ones strategical dimensions, but do note that enemy will jump around. Cities are not a safe zone. Game tries to irritate you into fight there propably even more than in the nature. Load will be used often. After you leave from first island, game will penalize you about loading with long load times. Don't dare to think what they would be without SSD.  You won't be using crafting much at anything. It has been downgraded close to zero from the first one forcing you to rely on drops and vendors with your gear.  Clear bugs that should not be in a finished product. ""Press B to end your turn"" indication is left to other players screen after battle. Game stops registering xbox controller that has been left unattended for a while. The quests also have a lot more unrefined feel to them compared to the first game.  The first Original Sin was difficult for us from time to time, but all in all it was rewarding. Can't say the same at all about the second one. A lot of clocked game time has been used looking at the same loading screen. Not just because of some difficult fights, but trying to realize if you were meant to fight with them at that point or at all as even your potential companions try pick a fight with you.  So, like I said earlier, I can't recommend this game to be the first Original Sin game. But I can't recommend it to be the second one either."

176,Rigel,170,14,0,2018-04-29,Not Recommended,22.1,"I'll be honest: For the life of me, I don't get why people love this game so much. Clearly they do.... I am very, very obviously in the minority so far as opinions go here. But I played the first few hours of the first game and despised it, and decided to try this one out because a bunch of friends wanted in on it and I heard they fixed a lot of the pacing issues from the first game.  It's a carbon copy of the first game, near as I can tell. Mistakes included. The game world is INCREDIBLY cluttered, full of items and backstories and details that are not and never will be important. It has a ton of mechanics, only a fracton of which ever seem even slightly important. It has a bunch of characters with complex backstories.... most of which don't matter in the slightest. Every fight is either way too easy or way too difficult with no middle ground.   A ton of backstory is thrown at you almost immediately, more than you can possibly take in quickly and requires you to either slow your pace to a crawl - which is DEATH in a multi-player RPG like this where everybody needs to be paying attention and equally invested in the story, lest someone get bored - OR, for you to just skim through it as quickly as possible and have no earthly idea what's going on. A character early on got killed in cold blood by another character; I had no idea who either one was, or why I was supposed to care, though I obviously was meant to.   The mechanics, as I mentioned, are often over-complicated and irrelevant. There are food items everywhere, and crafting components, but they hardly seem worth the effort, so why bother having them at all? They're just more noise. The graphics are detailed, but usually display a whole lot of nothing, so everything just winds up looking messy. The NPCs try to come across as endearingly fleshed out and bold, but they come across way too strong right out the gate -before you care enough about them to WANT to hear them ramble or listen to their backstories - so every time you open conversation with a new one you just kind of sigh and dig in for a few more minutes of dialogue from people you don't care about, concerning a subject which may or may not have any importance at all. It makes me want to not talk to anyone at all, which is BAD for an RPG like this. It comes across more as work than enjoyment.  Characters can stick together and listen in on each others' conversations.... but as mentioned, a lot of the time the discussions don't go anywhere at all, and you have to either carefully pace things so that everyone can hear and understand it, or else power through, either ignoring the plot elements or being forced to explain it to everyone later.  The game just has way, way, way too much going on. You would think that would be a good thing - more detail and more mechanics means more interesting and unique potential interactions, right? But instead, the game just feels ike an outing at the garbage dump - full of stuff, but the vast majority of it not even remotely worth your time. Having lots of content isn't bad, but the pacing here is just.... miserable. Stuff needs to be introduced to players gradually, in managable segments, and when we are appropriately invested in those elements.   As it was, I was bored out of my mind the entire time my group was playing last night. To be fair, I was the only one who felt that way. Everybody else seemed to be having a good time, and the rest of the internet seems to love this game too. But, for the life of me.... I don't know why.  "

Simply put it is a charming game with wonderful enviroment in a world that is deeper than one might think. It takes silly bit to far at times but never as far as lets say Borderlands 2 did which to me, ruined the whole game. Original Sin 2 is both a silly and grim story. The turnbased combat is excellent and it works so well with others. Prepare for a lot of backstabs if you play with nasty people! And prepare for twists.   There is not a better multiplayer RPG this side of Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2. The builds you can do are plenty and races bring their own special abilities, especially Elf and Undead have some unique mechanics, like eating body parts to gain memories of the dead and even abilities at times or Undead....being Undead.   There is at times some weird things. Like AI going nuts and doing not so optimal things or certain questlines not working correctly. RPGs with long questlines that the player sometimes managed to screw up by circumventing things by being cheesy is a classic thing in RPGs, The more advanced endings and options for a questline, the more keen to it breaking it is.   Beside these problems, Original Sin 2 is a excellent game, with nice character building, this is probably one of the strongest parts of the game! Just going nuts when it comes to builds. NPCs that are not so bad, Interesting characters and a developed world. Only thing I would want is a longer end act. The last settlement you are in could been a bit bigger to symbolize the size of it. For the next  game I hope to more of the same, even if it has to be crazy AI and questlines that is not always triggered in the correct way. I hope to see a Original Sin 3 in the coming years.  EDIT: I must point out that the issues could all stem from us taking breaks over a month at times which could off have broken things between patches. The game usually works very well otherwise."

Dumb game systems. Very unpolished, unclear, and unfair combat.  The whole beginning of the game has no linear movement. They want you to ""figure out"" that you can't do that quest yet by dying or failing it and come back later. Every fight you are outnumbered and overpowered. Dumb system.  This game purely likes to waste your time and make your life more difficult, when it could make more sense.  WAY OVERRATED  No refund either.

Pros:  + Huge amount of content. + Options to customize the initial class of all the members of your party + Main story is interesting, and there are some side plots which deserve attention + Very good for hardcore RPG players  Cons: - Performance issues: be ready for long loading times, and fps drops whenever there are many enemies on screen, or fire. There's one place in the game where, if you decide to go to combat (there's a non-violent solution), it becomes just unplayable - Random encounters and combats: some of your team members will do your best to provoke the wrong people at the wrong time and wrong level - 'Fake open world' and excessive trial-and-error: the world is huge, but a lot of time is wasted iterating across the map until you find those missions you can actually do, which brings me to the next point - Progression system: there's a huge gap between a level and the next. If you are level 17, and your enemy 18, it's virtually impossible to win (unless it is a 4 vs 1 situation). Those differences are also reflected in the equipment you wear. Also, the game obbliges you to do many side quests which are irrelevant, or where the amount of XP is maximized only when you behave in a certain way. - Buggy: some items may not work as expected, some quests will not be updated/closed. It feels rushed, and I really hope they release a 'Definitive Edition' as they did with the first one - Clunky crafting system (does anyone even bother to craft?) and persuasion system (some un-persuadable enemies will give you dialogues with persuasion checks... what's the point?)  This is personal: - I am not a fan of the dual armor system, given that magic armor builds on top of the enemies elemental resistances. I think it is an unnecessary complexity which gives you additional headaches when balancing your team between physical and magical"

This game is utterly amazing, that is not to say there are negatives (I will have a bullet point pros con list at the bottom of this review), but it did not take long for me to think of this game as one of my favorite RPG games ever made. I think of this game as a modern day baulders gate. It has great story, its sound tracks are amazing, combat is diverse and enjoyable. Multiplayer was done Superbly.  Now if you are thinking about getting this game, a here are a few things you should know before purchase. Combat is turnbased, if you do not like turnbased games you may not like this games (especially because it is not a cheap game). DO NOT play honor mode if you have yet to beat the game yet (its a mode that if your party all dies your ONLY save gets deleted, and the fights are at the hardest difficulty level), the triggers for this are NOT common, however there are traps that will instantly kill folk around them, Which I walked into all of them. Restarting your entire game because of a trap like that will drive you insane.    Agian I played back closer to release but, when I played there were a fair amount of bugs in the game. This game easily makes up for it, but the bugs do exsist. At certian points in the game you may be unsure what quest you should do next. (Now if you are playing normal mode this may not affect you like it did me, because I was playing a harder difficulty setting, and I needed ot make sure I was not fighting things higher level than my self) Because if you plan to follow the monster levels and have them be equal to yours, it requires you to jump around the map alot finding out what quest areas are your level (unless of course you look up a guide, i would advise agianst that).  The 2nd act? (third map its a island), I was not too fond of this area, and I think it will most likely be most peoples least favorite spot, there are some dry moments, just take it slow and get through it this game has some really cool suprises for you.  Also dont take lone wolf as a perk unless you want to ruin the game, its the closest thing to a cheat code in that game I know of, you can pretty much breeze through the game on hardest difficulty if you use it.   TLDR: Pros Cons List.  Pros -Great Story -Great Music -Well Balanced Combat / Enjoyable Combat -Cool Cast of characters -Good leveling system -Good multiplayer Setup -Waypoint system making map travel easier  Cons -Quest order can be confusing at times -Island map is a little dry at times  if you saw a video of this game, and liked the top down aesthetic, and understand this is a RPG, I would 10/10 rate this game for you, you should buy and play it you wont regret it."

81,Kasarian,233,3,1,2018-05-08,Not Recommended,21.6,"This is another ""wish there was neutral button"" review. It's also going to compare this game to the first one alot.  Pros: -Story telling (mainly sidequests) and interactions in the team you assemble (and personal quests of 6 premade characters) are SO much better than in first game, there are a lot of quests and less generic npc's but... -Both character creator and later thanks to readily available respec option you can build any character you want, in this aspect the game is bit more open minded than first one but... -Visually the game is pretty, same with music though...  Cons: -... that same storytelling has pacing problems. There are 5 chapters and with ending of 4th act it suddenly dies in my opinion. SPOILER It's typical ""you almost got the objective of the story to be snatched from your hands"" and you're thrown into another bug map with urgency that world is going to hell... but at the same take your time and go about exploring another map. -...but while you have a lot of leeway on how to build your character (and 3 companions)  I simply hate, HATE how suddenly Abilities were separated into Combat and Civil with points to the second being scarcely given out so you can't really have a Civily oriented character (and how Persuation is absolutely NEEDED for any interesting outcome) and Combat abilities being such a god damn MESS that your character you want to build for SCOUNDREL will be better off first  maxing out WARFRARE to deal more damage... (not to mention choosing perk, something I couldn't wait for in first game,  is just choosing an option which does NOT suck) -Combat and overall difficulty is a f***ing joke, not even taking in to the account the bonuses/debuffs to health/armor they present. As an example: In 5th act there is a small boss fight with one character specific quest, there is the boss and 6'ish minions Explorer - my level 20 characters equipped fully with Divines and Unique items steamrolled the fight so hard it's not even funny, abilities of enemies were hardly used and they just walked up to me to get themselves killed. Classic - By the time it my 1st character could move 1 character was already dead, one was about to join him and other 2 were heavily debuffed... There is a difference between AI is braindead  at half health and AI is going to bury you under the amount of debuffs and status effects before it's your turn. But maybe it's just me. -Item generator in this game is absolute garbage. If you don't fancy multiclassing your party (which the game actively encourages to the point it feels you're being pushed into it) finding ANYTHING that will suit your characters build is a god damn MIRACLE, oh and that nice item you DID find/buy? You throw it out the bloody window cause next level it is GARBAGE and crafting is... just there. I think this game has one ot THE worst item scalings I EVER played. -Ending is trash. It's on the level of pre-dlc Mass Effect 3 to me with an added option that no matter what you do everybody is ????ed (Rivellon) or your companions/npc are ?????? unhappy about your choice (and it's presented in a way as if it's your fault and you should've chosen better...) not to mention a lot of last fight reveals (the fight itself is  pure ???????tery) are just a joke...   TL;DR - game in MY opinion upgrades a lot of stuff upon first game but simply f***s up the stuff that was actually pretty good in first one. If you have a question about something this review didn't cover or want to expand comment, also this is my marginal opinion so take it with a grain of salt."
122,Maud'Dib,15,3,0,2018-05-08,Not Recommended,62.3,"I was really disappointed with this game. I really wanted to like it, but my frustration came down to 2 issues:  1) Randomness of elemental surfaces  This is supposed to be a strategic, tactical game, but the experience is completely marred by the randomness of the elemental surfaces. You can carefully position units and use spells to create surfaces only to have enemies randomly drop cursed surfaces that overwrite everything else are very difficult to remove.  Overall, it's difficult to prepare for a battle or try various tactics when the surfaces are so random and difficult to control. The game designers seem to love the surfaces mechanic to the extend that the entire battle system practically revolves around it, and I found it kind of boring and frustratingly unpredictable.  2) Strange difficulty settings  The game is either way too easy or way too hard. I've read interviews with the devs saying they want the game to be hardok, then why did you provide difficulty settings at all? It seems like hedging on their design. if they want this to be a difficult game, that would be fine and I'd know it's probably not for me. Difficulty settings imply I should be able to tailor the experience, and that option really isn't there. It's either brutally difficult or so easy that every enemy dies in a single hit.  I want some challenge, but I have a limited amount of time to play games and I don't want to spend 2 hours reattempting the same battle. On the other hand, the easiest difficulty setting makes the game so easy it's not really even enjoyable (it's so easy I'd rather just read a book).  Overall, I was either frustrated or bored. "

However, I wish Larian had put as much effort into making it RUN STABLE. The game crashes about every half hour, this makes the game almost unplayable.  Buying this game is a little like buying a shiny, charming car which will (with high probability) only drive for 30 consecutive minutes and then you have to restart it. On top of all, even the crash reporter crashes with a useless error message. To me that technical sloppiness indicates that the devs have put all their work in the looks and not the overall experience.  Finally, I think it's a PITY that such a nice, enjoyable game is ruined by the seeming unwillingness of the devs to make IT RUN STABLE."

For me, a well-written plot is just as important as good quality gameplay (at least for RPGs).  The player character's allies seemed unlikable and weren't fun to be with.  That and the world of the game doesn't seem interesting or even all that unique.   I've heard that the ending is pretty bad, but I couldn't even get to it.  Not that it's too hard, I had to stop because the game world made me very depressed.  I've played bleak games before, but in those games I could always make some sort of change for the better.  The gameplay was good, but the story made this unenjoyable.   I regret buying this.  It surprises me to see how many people like this game.  I'm not entirely sure why I feel so horrible when I play or even think about this game, but I am sure that I don't like it.

And my god, those NPCs.  In addition to having the game's premades shoved into your face, as party members there are no less than three snooty, arrogant noble types (out of the five or six party members I've come across). Even the others started grating on me.  There's a massive mechanics/story disconnect with the party members, as well. Each one comes with their own well-traveled backstory. It's an RPG, so that's par for the course. But don't tell me this 10,000 year old sorcerer will gladly start picking locks if I ask him nicely when we meet. If you're so proud of your characters, game, at least have the confidence to give them a defined skillset.  And as an aside, the game made a huge deal about me starting as undead, and that it would be a more difficult experience. Apparently, that means 'always wearing a hat.' The fact that every potential party member was 100% cool with it from the word go also robbed it of any story impact it might have had.  Ultimately, I play RPGs for interesting characters and story. The story didn't grip me, and the characters, well...  Combat was okay."

The quote-on-quote moral choices you make don't seem impactful at all when this narrative is driven forward no matter what. The dialogue, which is besides the combat the bread and butter of the game, gets extremely preachy and tiresome very quickly.

16,Vancrist,143,40,6,2018-05-14,Not Recommended,117.4,"I'm going to start with the positive. Character creation is awesome and fun. Character progression is awesome and fun. Being able to return to your 'base' and respec is super cool incase you get bored and just don't like the direction you went in several levels ago.   Now for the bad   The first 1/4 of this game is super fun. I loved it. I thought it was awesome.....then I got to act two. It starts going down hill there...by act three its starting to go down hill faster and faster....act four it just crashes into the ground and burrows in deep. The farther you get in the game it seems like the less the devs actually tried. The story is interesting but also convuluted and can be at times kinda hard to follow. There are several factions and you have a very goldfish like relationship with them that doesn't make sense. One moment a faction is trying to turn you into a mindless zombie and the next moment...you are...doing quest....for them....becasue they are good now?  The combat becomes a mess. The way the system works is that you have physical armor and magical armor. CC abilities have absolutely no effect unless the armor type they coorispond to is depleted form your target. This isn't a problem early game when targets don't have that much armor but late mid game to late game....don't plan on using CC any time soon...unless that CC is provoke which is devestating when your enemies use it but worthless when you use it. Let me explain:  So provoke is an AOE that works even if the targets of it are full armor. When you use this on enemies most of the time they were just auto attack the person who uses it. When the enemies use it on you, however, all of your characters will blow all your important cooldowns, use all your limited resources, and waste all your consumables. All those super hard to make/get potions you were saving? they will just start spam drinking them like they were water. That ability that refreshes your cooldowns at the cost of source? (source being a limited resource for casting certain spells). Welp, you just used it even though its round 1 and you have nothing on cooldown....killer.  Charm is also another absolutely worthless effect when you use it but super devestating effect when the enemy uses it. The spell charm is worthless because it costs so many actions a turn to use and at best the enemy will auto attack ONCE and then pass turn. At worse the enemy will just reposition themselves so when the charm wears off they have a prime spot for destroying you. When you get charmed, however, prepare to watch your characters blow all your cooldowns and go balls to the wall on your teammates with no restraint. Its just not fun. Its not fun at all.  So initiative is based off your initiative score and your wits stat. Loading points into wits I could still never get first go in any fight. At least 1 (most of the time 2) enemies always went before me and since the game always makes you group up in a tight square at the start of every fight that is enough for those enemies to just unload AOEs on your entire party and leave you nearly dead if not dead. NPCs will always also have more action points than you. I've counted spells and checked AP costs and yea, most of them start fights with 6 AP which is 2 more than you which is a whole nother spell most of the time. Being how most of the time the enemies will out number you by at least 1 if not 2 (in some cases much more) this makes fights nerve wracking messes.   The final boss fight in this game is a trainwreck. I can't go into detail about how screwed up it is because its just that screwed up. Again, outnumbered by NPCs that are stronger than you and have initiative over you even though you are the one who starts the fight. Its actually two fights in one and it goes immediately into the second fight after the first fight so any downed party members are gone and health totals/armor totals remain what they were before but its a new fight so of course the enemy gets initative over you to spam AOE on you in this barely living state.....there are also other problems with this fight that I won't go into because they spoil story things but needless to say...its not fun.  A lot of the quests just end. A lot of them are very buggy and end without telling you they are over so they are in your log indefinately. Some of them end bcause you did something that failed the quest HOWEVER the game doesn't tell you that you failed....they just remain in your log unfinished. A lot of the quests just have no direction and you are are supposed to make leaps in logic that are just nonsensical unless you read it from an online guide. The farther you get in the game the worse this problem becomes. By act 4 just don't bother with the quests because they are just aweful messes.   Crafting.....is aweful in this game. Complete crap. Its like they started it, got about 30% of it done, then called it a day. The only thing you will ever really craft are potions, arrows, runes. I mean, you might craft food to to an extent, the grenades really aren't worth making, weapons and armor you can craft are jokes and not funny ones. You can craft spell books but chances are it would just be less of a head ache to buy them most of the time. Most of the stuff you'll be crafting you'll be looking up the recepies online for them because chances are you won't find them in game or at least not before they become to weak to bother with. Its just frustrating.   Gear: This is another big point. The loot you get seems to just suck more and more the farther in the game you get. What ever random system generates what stats gear have is dumb. Most of the time you get combinations that just don't really benefit anyone. about 95% of the loot drops i got were so so for 2-3 of the people in my party but not exactly great for any of them. Like, when it comes to magic certain schools compliment each other and certain schools kinda contrast. Water and air go together well because water leaves pools and puddles behind and lightning from air can apply shock through the puddles. Earth and fire work out because earth tends to leave behind oil or poison which is combustable when you mix it with fire. So its head scratching that most of the items you get are something like ""This armor require a high finesse score to wear (not int which is what mages mostly build) but doesn't have any scoundrel like boons on it...insteal it gives you plusses to opposing magic schools like +2 to air and +2 to earth.....because those stats just work out so well with each other. Now I know with the customizable options you can very easily have a character with points in all of these for one reason or another but they wouldn't be your main focus nor what you would want on their gear. And even when you get to level 21 the game will still insist on giving you crappy level 16-18 gear that just makes you sigh and shake your head.  The worse part about all of this is that at the end of the game it just seems so small and empty.  The first two acts do take some time to get through but the third and fourth act are probably shorter than the first act even when you combine the two. The game just gets weaker and weaker and weaker which is unfortunate. There is also a finite amount of xp you can ultimately get. Once you clear out an area its cleared out for good. I guess that is fine but ultimately it makes the fights limited and such which may not have been a bad thing being how the combat system gets worse the farther in the game you go.   I have started a new game several times to try out different combinations. I find myself getting past the first act though and then I just stop caring after that. I know that its just downhill from there."
23,Tom Sawyer,496,104,8,2018-05-14,Not Recommended,229.5,"Pros:+ Story is better than in 1 + Combat is mostly pleasant + Dialogues are voiced  Cons:- Bugs, bugs and more bugs - Multiplayer is an afterthought - Armor system - A certain patch practically ruined combat  In-depth:I want to say that I love this game, but it is a horrible, abusive, love-hate relationship. I'm very curious, how many people that leave positive reviews finished this game. Because the further you go, the worse it gets.  But let's start with the beginning. The first 1/4 of this game is amazing. It has huge variety in the ways you can do your quests, very few bugs, pretty good story all-around. This part of the game deserves all the praise Divinity gets. The next 1/2 of this game is... kinda meh. The worst part about it is the sheer amount of unfinished, unsatisfying side-quests. Quests that can be failed simply because there is no ""let's talk about it later"" option in the dialogue for you to think things through. Quests that fail without any warning if you go through other quests before finishing them. Plus, the sheer amount of crowd-control your enemies get at this point, combined with crappy loot you probably still have makes combat much less fun. And finally, the last 1/4 of this game is honestly just a buggy mess. Including the final battle, which is the most frustrating thing I've ever encountered in this game. Without spoiling anything, there is a place during the final battle, that literally just has invisible walls on the field. It makes no sense and ruins your ability to position yourself without teleport. And if you do teleport, you can cheese your way out of this fight by teleporting to the other side of the invisible wall while enemies run around. This is dumb. Combine it with the fact that some enemies can one-shot you (and I'm talking about normal difficulty here, btw), the character animations bug out, enemies get stuck in the columns etc.  And while we are on the topic of endgame, let me talk about multiplayer quickly. You know, in the first one both characters had something to say in the dialogue and any player could sway the NPC his way. Well, not here. If you are talking to somebody, the other players have absolutely 0 control over how the dialogue goes. They can pick a comment after it, like ""yeah, I support you"" or ""nah, I don't agree"", but that doesn't make any difference. There is no morality or stat changes based on it, and of course anyone has to live with the choices you've made.  So, what does it have to do with endgame? Well, over the course of our multiplayer game, I was tasked with talking to most NPC, because I had the best stats for it... except before the final fight, where despite me coming to the NPC we needed to talk to, they started talking to the other player (and trust me, we tried to force them to talk to me, reloading multiple times to try and engage them differently). However, while talking to that player (who was playing a male character), the NPC constantly addressed him as a female (and I was playing one). This seriously ruined any immersion we had left after numerous bugs and broken quests we encountered on the way there.  There are a few other fantastic examples of quests that frustrated us a lot, but I can not talk about them without spoilers, so... spoilers (skip it if you don't want any). So, there's a quest about a wedding. The groom is being an ??????? who wants bride's riches but she doesn't know about it. You can find his diary where he explains all his plans. Can you give it to her? Nope. Can you give it to her parents? Nope. You can, however, confront him about it. Ok. Let's talk. He tells you that he wants your help in killing the bride's father. If you say no... that's it. The quest doesn't finish, but you can do absolutely nothing else. If you talk to father - nothing, bride - nothing. If you talk to the groom again... nothing. You can't change your mind to progress this quest. Turns out, the way you finish it is - accept the murder and then go about betraying the groom if you want. Yay... variety... *facepalm*  There is another quest that involves a person who killed his master. You can figure it out by talking to master's spirit. And the person himself is sitting in the tavern, talking about how he loves the stew a lot. You can promise his master's spirit to deal with him. Logically, the first thing that we thought about is - poison the stew. Right? Makes sense? You can do it in the crafting menu, you can give him the stew. Great? Not great. It has absolutely no effect on him. Attacking him is also a bad idea, because it turns everybody in the town hostile to you. Turns out, you MUST find a special poison that is not lethal, but will make him run to the toilet where you'll deal with him. And that's the ONLY solution.  What the ?????  Moving on. Here's how crowd control works in this game. Every character and enemy has physical armor and magical armor. Until this armor is 0, no crowd control of appropriate type works on them. You can love this system or hate it, doesn't matter, it's how it works. Or at least it is how it used to work until one patch changed the single crowd control spell. The spell is ""Provoke"". And it does what you may expect, taunts the target so it automatically attacks the one who used it. And it ignores armor. Now, imagine that the enemy taunted your whole party, and you are now stuck watching them fight automatically. And you could not prevent it. Sounds like fun to you yet? Wait, there's more. Normally, in RPG ""taunt"" skills make your characters use auto attacks and that's it. Which sure, can be annoying for mages, but it doesn't ruin the combat completely. But no, not in Divinity. Here, the taunted character not only uses skills (which, I remind you, go on lengthy cooldowns and can cost ""source"" which is a semi-limited resource), but also uses items from your inventory. Your rare and expensive potions, grenades, magical arrows, scrolls. My character ate all my tea leaves which I was saving for the final battle and drank the super limited quest potion that, again, I was saving for the occasion, after which she used some of my best skills randomly (it's AI, it is stupid), and when I finally got control back, I had a mage with all the skills on cooldown, all my rare items used, and nothing to do but auto attack or reload the save... Who the ???? thought this was a good idea? Oh, and to add insult to injury, my character's summon used to have ""provoke"" by default as well. Guess what, after the patch, they removed it. Great job, guys, great job...    Overall, this game is fine. It has nice tactical combat (minus Provoke), mostly interesting dialogue (at least for the one who initiates it), and it looks very good with it's various elemental effects and armors. But this game is just that - ok. It doesn't deserve any GOTY titles, it doesn't deserve all the praise it gets. It's not some RPG messiah. It's buggy, it has horrible balance issues, it is a fairly bad experience for your multiplayer partners (or for you, whoever doesn't get to experience dialogues), it has tons of unfinished quests or quests that just don't make any sense. The more you play this game, the more it feels like early access that needs a lot of polish to be good. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it patched in a very long time (2 months at the time of this review), it seems like the developers decided that it's ""good enough, whatever"".  Well it's not.

While the game is evidently made by talented people with passion for their work, I did not enjoy it much. Audio/visual side of things, this game is gorgeous, and combat is fun and engaging, but can get a little tedious. Voice acting top notch. But the game on whole is a slow slog, with the most cliched high fantasy setting and dull story. Ye that allows for some funny scenarios, but it's not at all immersive and the world/map is so condensed and level scaled, that is similar to MMORPG only 50 times smaller. I mean you happen upon a ravaged caravan, and have to bring news to city guard 20 meters away, it's all silly, like they could not hear or see giant voidwoken worms attacking it. They should just do more maps and let them breathe a little and not filled them to the total brim with quest/secrets/enemies etc. Would improve exploring/adventure vibe. Item management is hellish and there is just so much fluff that gets in the way of doing the fun stuff."

You search it up and you will find things everywhere like ""best pc game of 2017"", ""best RPG ever"", ""best game XXX've ever played"".

379,Clown Baby,304,4,1,2018-05-18,Not Recommended,27.9,"Sorry guys, I don't see why this game is so well loved or recieved.  The balance is horrible. Magic is pretty much worthless, except necromancy, which takes the entire game and runs it over. Play melee, bows (which do the exact same thing as magic), and necromancy or die. Don't like it? That sucks. It's not like it's impossible with other builds, but you will have a frustrating time, I promise you. You WILL find fights that you're not allowed to escape from that WILL kill you, completely randomly, which is where resurrection scrolls come in, and they get their own section later.  The story is well written, but horribly paced. Prepare for loooong swathes of gameplay with very little story actually going on, as you jump from sidequest to sidequest, using an interface that was apparently designed by a man with his head stuck in a filing cabinet. After 20 hours, I really just found myself not caring about the overarching plot. I kind of liked my party members, but their sidequests take just as long to get going as everything else. It's a lot of ""I think we'll find this guy is Crapville"", but Crapville is three acts and 30 hours away.  But by far the worst design decision are the resurrection scrolls. This game kind of has perma-death, but not really. Rather than killing a character and making you get a new one, your character dies, becomes locked in your party, and this ghost...soul thing hovers in place until you can bring them back with a scroll. Don't have one? That sucks, go craft one. The things to craft them are totally random drops? Oh, then you're up a creek without a paddle, my friend. You cannot dismiss a dead party member to replace them, and you can't do anything about them if you can't get a scroll. This means that, best case scenario, if you don't have a scroll, prepare to go walk to town, talk to everyone to buy one, then walk allllll the way back.   Why not just have a priest in town to bring your character back for the same cost as the scroll? If you want to punish me for messing up, that's fine, good on you, but this can render the game unwinnable, especially if your healer goes down and you can't pick them back up. A game mechanic that encourages me to savescum over and over again until I either get RNGesus to not kill my squishy mage before I can move or quit is NOT good game design. It's frustrating, easily avoidable horsecrap.  The environments look fantastic, easily AAA quality, and the voice acting is nice, but the gameplay is a complete mess. After nearly 30 hours of play, I'm just done. I'm sick of hoarding scrolls for no reason. I'm sick of being bored because necromancer is the only way to play. I'm sick of the plot going at a snail's pace. I just can't do it. This game feels like it was made 20 years ago, and that's not a good thing. Stuff like this isn't in RPGs anymore for a reason.  Say ""git gud"" all you want, it's doesn't help. The game isn't about getting good. I never felt like I was learning the combat or different strategies. In fact, I felt like I was actively punished for saying ""maybe I shouldn't rely on this all the time"", because then I'd have to buy a dozen skillbooks to be brought up to speed in a skill that I hadn't used.  I don't get it. I don't understand the love, I don't understand the fun that can be derived from this. This is an uphill slog against archaic game mechanics masquarading as challenging gameplay, rather than anything meaningful."

36,Emperor Gandhi,281,137,2,2018-05-20,Recommended,104.4,"Like my reviews? Go follow my Curator page.   As a younger gamer, I never got to experience games like Diablo 2 or Baldur's Gate in their prime, and by the time I was old enough to understand and appreciate the RPG genre, the gaming industry moved onto 3D, first/third-person RPGs like Fallout 3 and Oblivion. Eventually, CRPGs made a comeback, and I jumped onto that hype train only to be pretty disappointed. As other CRPGs haven't quite hit the spot for me, I saw this game get released on Steam and chose not to buy it because I thought I'd be underwhelmed yet again.  That was a huge mistake. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 suffers from some very serious flaws, the game's strengths are done so well that the fairly popular claim that this game is one of the ""best RPGs of all time"" is completely justified.  Graphics As was the case with the first game, the visuals are surprisingly pretty. Even though the overall tone of this game is rather dark (especially compared to D:OS 1) it still retains some of the first game's light-hearted charm and this can be reflected in the bright, cartoony visuals. The main characters are all interesting and unique visually, and the character creation system itself is incredibly deep from an appearance standpoint. Aside from some occasional frame drops, the game is pretty impressive visually.  Gameplay Divinity: Original Sin 2's biggest strength, one that makes it one of the all-time greats, is its incredible amount of player choice. This is reflected in almost every aspect of the game. The addition of physical and magic armor means that you're going to need to think a little bit more when it comes to party composition and prioritizing targets, while simply stunlocking an enemy to death isn't as effective now. On top of this, with the sheer amount of skills in the game, there are so many different ways to approach a situation. For example, you could hack away at a troll, or you could turn him into a chicken and teleport him into a pit of lava. Or, you could summon a monster (one that's just as large as that troll) on top of a fire, causing the monster to be infused with fire, and have the two duke it out with each other. The variety in skills adds so much depth to the already refined turn-based combat mechanics of the first game. While some skills and talents are better than others, the classes overall are pretty fairly balanced and offer you a lot of wiggle room to make your characters more well-rounded, and the weaker skills/talents are still playable at least. The game is also difficult, but it very rarely felt unfair. Even then, thanks to the incredible amount of choice in this game, you can easily exploit these unfair fights. Where the game falls flat gameplay-wise, however, is the final boss. Without going into spoilers, it takes the biggest strengths of this game and throws them out the window, turning into an absolute mess where you barely get to do anything. Overall though, aside from the final boss, everything in the gameplay department is perfect. The combat mechanics are deep and incredibly fun, the game overall is mostly fairly balanced, the armor system makes the game more interesting, and the sheer amount of choice makes just about anything possible. The gameplay alone makes this game worthwhile at full price, and the enhanced edition should (hopefully) make it even better.  Story Unfortunately, on the other end of the spectrum, the weakest part of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is its story. While the writing is good and the pacing starts off fairly consistent, this all goes out the window for the last third of the game. From the big climax in Act 3 and onward, the pacing goes all over the place. Act 3 as a whole is over extremely quickly, while Act 4 is drawn out some more but still fairly easy to blow through. As mentioned before, the final boss takes the biggest strengths and throws them out the window, and this includes the writing. As an example of this, one of my party members told my character that he would support me no matter what decision I made, only to get mad at me for choosing something he apparently didn't support. This happened over the span of about 30 seconds, and I'm not exaggerating that either. All of the character development of your party members is thrown aside for some reason, and it makes the finale that much more frustrating. On top of this, none of the endings are satisfying. While I understand the approach they tried to take, the drop in quality of the writing made all of them feel stupid and nullified all the progress you made in the game. However, everything else is great. Fort Joy was brilliant, and I loved watching the island slowly open up for you to explore as you escaped it. Driftwood, while definitely a lot slower paced, was filled to the brim with entertaining quests and the classic D:OS charm. Plus, the amount of player choice is also reflected here. You can talk your way out of a situation in a wide variety of different ways, and your decisions do have weight to them. Overall, while the first two acts of the game are incredible, the last two are not as great and will likely leave you disappointed.  Audio Remember how I said that almost everything in this game could be changed by the player? Well I wasn't kidding. You can choose your character's instrument, which plays during the battle (to the music) when you kill an enemy. I also personally find it pretty impressive how much of this game is voice acted. With the exception of a few conversations, almost everything has competent voice acting. Another pleasant suprise was how much I enjoyed the soundtrack. While I liked the first game's music, not much stuck out for me aside from the classic tavern music and the main menu theme. In this game, however, I found myself humming along to music like the Lady Vengeance theme and the tavern battle theme. While neither of these things are major highlights to the game, they're both done very well and do make the experience significantly more entertaining as a result.  Replayability As choice is this game's biggest strength, the replayability for D:OS 2 is very high, moreso than most other RPGs in my opinion. There's no way you can see or do everything in a single playthorugh, plus the party member quests are entertaining enough that you'll probably want to see them through for every character. Plus, with the inclusion of the excellent Game Master mode, even if you don't do multiple playthroughs of the game, you'll be spending hours on top of hours in this game. There's so many different combinations of classes and skills that experimenting is incredibly fun, and so you'll definitely have a lot of motivation to play through the game again.  Verdict To conclude, while Divinity: Original Sin 2 suffers from things like frame drops and an incredibly weak finale, the game's strengths overshadow its weaknesses so much that I still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might even be remotely interested. People weren't kidding, this truly is one of the best RPG games ever made, and the enhanced edition has the potential to make it the best.

75,Kabooozie,15,4,1,2018-05-20,Not Recommended,90.2,"I enjoyed this game for about 100 hours, so it's hard to say I can't recommend it. It has many pros: -clever writing -great narration -a truly D&D experience where your abilities can interact with the world in interesting and unexpected ways -some truly difficult, satisfying combat  But. The game is imbalanced, and drags on way too long. There are intense difficulty spikes even on normal diffuculty where, despite being overleveled, encounters feel unfair. This happens especially at the beginning if you don't know exactly what order to do quests to gain XP. I once fought some level 2 frogs for an hour and a half and didn't get anything. Many of the systems are just obtuse and outdated. This game does not subscribe to modern, streamlined, meaningful design. There is so much of the game that just wastes your time."

1459,pH. mmSNAKE,372,2,0,2018-05-21,Recommended,362.6,"Good part of a year passed before I decided to write this up. I have been playing since release but I haven't felt I played the game enough for reasons I'll outline. This is a crpg developed by Larian, sequal to Divinity Original Sin. Overall this sort of title is specific, however if you like rpg games like this, the kind that take long hours to beat, have extensive skill mechanics and build possibilities then look no further, the game delivers in spades.  The overall gameplay format is that you control up to four characters.  You move and explore in real time, but combat is turn based. Much like Divinity Original Sin. However there are important mechanics that change the game up a lot. First every piece of gear will have armor it provides. There are two kinds of armor, physical and magic. While you have armor value you are immune to almost every CC effect spells and skills can do to you, once that armor is depleated your HP will take damage and you will be succeptible to crowd controlling effects. This goes naturally for enemies as well. So the tactical portion of this combat relies around you managing armor of enemies and stopping them from getting a turn if you can. Sure eventually you can build your character/s that you outright kill anything that moves in a turn, however, majority of the game this will not be the case.  Combat in general is fairly involved. You have MANY skills to choose from, considerably more than last game. Each of the 'schools' have ineractions which may not be straight forward. Warfare school boosts ALL physical damage, that includes any and all spells which deal physical damage (like necromancy, reactive armor, polymorph etc). You have your basic attributes, you have talents and you have your non combat civil abilities and racial benefits. Everything you pick will affect how you play and solve problems. Civil abilities offer you a huge variety in how to solve problems. Stealing items, persuading people, sneaking around, being better at bartering and so forth. Most quests usually have multiple ways to tackle them. Don't have any lockpicks or keys for a door? Blow it up. You can't persuade a guy to give you an item? Steal it, or kill him and take it off his corpse. And so forth. While it isn't as diverse and brazen as say Fallout 2, it still offers a good variety of things you can do and how you go about it. Even the origin tags like Scholar, Outlaw or Mystic will benefit you to solve some quests. Most things in this game have some sort of purpose. Being undead means poison heals you, but healing magic hurts you, it also may have poor response from people when you talk to them without a mask or helm.  Now you can play either solo or co-op. I played mostly co-op, until I decided to have a solo campaign much later. When you create a character you can create an unique generic no background character OR you can pick one of the six scripted origin characters. Those characters have their own quest lines (along the main one) and they are recognised in the world. They have more interaction and give overall a better more diverse and interactive experience than if you just play with custom characters. My first co-op game we all made a custom character. That was a mistake. Custom character has one good boon though and that it gets an unique ability called Dome of Protection, and that skill is incredibly useful for majority of the game. Other than that if you don't pick origin characters you miss a lot of interaction with some of the best quests in the game.   Story wise the base main story is average. It's your standard ""i need to become a god to save the world"" quest. Some silly twists along the way but nothing really deviates from this. However interacting with the world and doing various side quests that give the game character is where its strengths lie. It isn't as well fleshed out as say Witcher 3, but it's pretty close. Your experience also may depend on the companions you pick, you may not like some but may love others, as the ones you don't pick won't be present much in the game. Also don't worry about missing the story with the first game. There are only a few amount of cameos. Mostly the game is very far apart.  Pacing and Balance? Well this is where the game hits a snag a bit. Pacing is off. Act 1 is difficult because you don't have many skills to work with and it feels like a LONG tutorial. Act 2 is absolutely massive, consists of bulk of the game, and it's easily the game's strongest point. Act 3 then deviates from the whole experience by being extremely short, in general lacking substance, quests and just??????to do and explore. Act 4 to me was great because it was finale for many storylines you started even in act 1, plus most of the fights in this act are damn fun, both because you grew nearly crazy in power and because opponents you face are on the level you expect them to be.  Balance wise well depends. If you are the kind of person who will sit down and learn the ins and outs of the game you will probably CRUSH this game once you get a grasp of your builds. Difficulty in first act and some of the second act is mostly due to lacking options and source skills, but once you start getting source skills you can build some obscenely powerful character. To me that's fine...this is a game where you are trying to ascend to godhood afterall. Just be warned, some builds are absolutely disgusting how powerful they are, if you look them up or figure it out. There are also various I would say exploits. Where due to how transition from real time into turn based can be abused, as well as some skills that just take advantage of the AI. Still there is plenty of tactical thinking, but once you start getting up in the levels and you know what you are doing, tactics will be replaced with you leaving mutilated corpses and craters behind you.  Is it worth the money? Abolutely. I bought this game on full price and haven't regreted it one second. It is much like Witcher 3, where you have a ton of content and plenty of replayability. This game is LONG so take that into consideration. It's fairly normal for your campaign to last you 70-100 hours if not more, especially if playing with others. Be aware that in august Larian will be releasing Definitive Edition, which will be a separate entry in steam BUT if you own this game before it is released you will get it for free (much like Enhanced Edition with previous game). The new edition will be adding lots of new content including rework of Act 3 (which to me is a big plus) as well as balncing changes and so forth. If you are tight on time and know you won't have a chance to play more than one campaign in  a long amount of time, then you might consider waiting until august to play but you might buy it now or on discount (since you will get DE anyway). If you like these sorts of games, chances are this will bring a huge smile to your face and you will end up enjoying it, solo or with other people. Larian created a superior sequal, in many ways. I eagerly wait to see their future efforts."

But several things hinder it to reach its full potential: Some combat skills take ages to be cast, which after the xth time gets really annoying. The charmed/taunted/maddened stats are horrific, because then the computer takes over your character and starts using random consumables like ????????. In the combat there are often bugs, where it shows you that a spell is going to hit, but it just hits some random object or surface and gets blocked. The game takes ages to load. I know this is partly because of my system, but my main point here is, that in coop, the host needs to load the game and then invite other players, which in turn need to load again. A looby would have been nice here. There are often bugs when loading the game. There are often bugs while saving the game in coop, which kicks your fellow players (I suspect this only occurs on low end host systems).  This is a game, which makes me love and hate it at the same time. I'd really like to play through it a 2nd time, but because of all these above mentioned points I don't know.

14,Naharri,136,14,0,2018-05-22,Not Recommended,158.8,"So far, this game has two modes for me.  Absolutely amazing, and utter disaster. For the section of the game, I found that approaches to quests and combat to be interested and quite varried.  I could fight or talk my way out of most encounters or approach a with a different tactic if I lost the first time.  Most quests offered many different ways to complete their object.  For example, the first Major quest is escaping from the ""bad guys,"" and I can think of at least 5 different ways to do so. Combat was similiar, only in two or three fights did I have to start the fight over to change my positioning or spells/equipment to beat the monster.  However, this all changed when i got to the second area of the game.  So many times i have to restart fights to preposition characters or switch gear/spells just so that i can beat the encounter.  Many quests started having only one or two options, many times being fight or pass the skill check, which seems to stem from 1 talent, regardless of which skill is being utilized.  Most monsters hit for double the damage my characters do at the same level, which wouldn't be much of an issue, if they didn't already have more health, armor, magic armor, and seemingly more action points than my own.    While I did enjoy the beginning of this game, it quickly devolved into a gear/level check that unless i constantly reoutfitted every character ever level or two, at no small cost of gold and time (and a hint of luck that vendors had what i needed), being taken out of the immersion by having to exploit knowledge of fights that were coming up, or reloading multiple times to reposition characters to fight the ambush and not have everyone crowd controlled on the first turn.    While it started Very interesting and full of choice, this game quickly fell into frustation of reloading and prepositioning for most fights that might have been difficult or facerolling over those that weren't.  Add into the mix having to utilize specific methods of fighting or cheesing fights just got old quickly."

Pros: + Pleasant artstyle and shaders. + Dialogue between playable characters themselves and NPCs are interesting and engaging. + Crisp sound-effects and battle animations. + Mix-&-match freely with abilities (not locked to starter class).  Cons: - Very unbalanced encounters. - Game mechanics forces you to stack one damage type and play heavily on meta-knowledge. - Resurrection is not possible without scrolls, no option to raise the dead after combat or by holy building in towns. - Teleportation skills sometimes breaks the game. - Loot is boring and uninspired. - Crafting is cluttered and needlessly obscuring.  Now into a bit of the nitty-gritty parts. The game has good visual quality, decent voice acting (with the exception of the created character's voices) and allows for varied characterisation with the mix-&-match style of abilities. These aspects combined makes for a more natural character progression and development as the story unfolds.  Later on, when combat becomes more of a focus, the problems are quickly apparent. I understand the idea behind having a physical armor pool and magical armor pool to block each type of damage/status effects. The inherent problem with this design is that it forces the player to put all damage into one type to overcome only one armor type. With some simple math many players, including me, have concluded that a full physical party is the dominant setup, leaving one member as a hybrid for times when enemies have no magical armor and can be slowed down with one spell. However, physical abilities are more reliable to disable and lockdown multiple enemies over magical abilities.  A downside of having a pure magic caster are surfaces, which is one of the selling points this game has. Yes, you can use wet surfaces to your advantage but that is a double-edged sword. Because this game's very heavy usage of reposition abilities, the crowd of enemies you want to affect with Shocking will most likely affect your party members too. This is because of the AI scripting which makes enemies dogpile onto your weakest character (this makes a tanking build virtually useless since enemies can simply teleport past your tank, making attacks of opportunity useless) and even run through Attacks of Opportunity or burning surfaces to secure a kill.  Every encounter fought will almost always start with your party bunched up and vulnerable to splash damage. If you try to split up your party you might find the other members being outside combat and ending up dead last in initiative when you walk them into the combat zone and all enemies are free to act first. You may find yourself wander into an empty valley when an encounter springs up and the enemy are already in perfect positions (split up on both sides and on top of high ground too high to teleport to from bottom level). While creatures with height advantage gains damage bonuses and vice versa, this causes a significant disadvantage which you constantly have to meta-game around by re-entering combat (fleeing or quick loading) and remember the enemy positioning so you can setup a counter.  Take all of this into account and one hard-counter strategy is nearly required and that is Teleportation or Nether Swap. These spells are not bound to the rules of armor and can be used on almost anyone, meaning you can pull a boss away from its minions and dogpile the boss before the minions catch up. You may also teleport ranged enemies down from their perches and hopefully manage to dogpile them before they teleport back up in sequence.  My final straw was when I entered an area at Level 10 where I needed a quest item. Taking this quest item and leaving meant a multitude of creatures (6 + 1 ""Elite"" version) appearing and acting almost immediately. We were of equal level, they had relatively low health, no physical armor nor magic armor and could be brought down with one Whirlwind of my Fighter. Taking that group down caused a duplicate group to appear on the opposite side of the room (contextually) and the Elite, which was left alive, cast a resurrection spell which brought all dead enemies back to 50% health and first in initiative order. They start with 5 action points (as they can move and attack twice) and deal about 170 damage per hit. Now we fight a group of 12 + 2 Elites and all of them act before my entire party and to make matters worse, there are a total creature count of 24 + 2 Elite in that same room.  Running this encounter in a D&D Challenge Rating calculator using 24 monsters CR 6 (as they are easier to kill) and 2 Elites CR 8 (one by itself poses not much of a threat) comes up to an encounter challenge rating of 30 (meaning your party need to be at level 30 for this battle to be at equal difficulty). Obviously these systems are very different in mechanics, but the encounter scaling works fairly similarly. This calculation discounts any abilities to resurrect creatures. This game is an unbalanced mess of 'you vs the system', with extensive need of immersion-breaking meta-knowledge to overcome its artificial difficulty.  All of these aspects creates an incredibly frustrating and unintuitive playing experience where you are required to:  Stack one damage type with multiple ranged characters.  Have multiple teleportation abilities (for yourself and enemies)  Constantly chase after enemies who teleport around to catch them.  Struggle against the unintuitive targeting system (I have missed attacks when the attack-line targeted the floor and not the enemy my cursor pointed at).  Fight a system which clearly is designed against you:  Enemies have consumables, but cannot be stolen nor looted if killed prior to using them.  Mindless creatures (zombies & constructs) intelligently navigates, with perfect calculation, where to walk through a sea of fire and survive with single digit hitpoints when it would otherwise kill them if they walked as expected.   Enemy ranged attackers have longer range than your characters on equal elevation.  Lack of spell restrictions. E.g. an enemy who can summon a creature, which can summon another creature, which can summon another creature, ad nauseam.   Enemy mass-resurrection spells places their revived creatures after the reviver in initiative. A trial & error mentality of encounter designs. (discover the encounter, lose from overwhelming odds and retry, specificly to counter the enemy setup).   Yes, I know games need to be challenging.  That being said, when you are required to stack certain abilities/playstyles and know what abilities and enemy placements are going to be, before engaging an encounter, to have a fighting chance.. You have failed as a dungeon master and a designer."

Unfortunately combat, even on the easiest setting, is like pulling teeth. Using the environment to your advantage is supposed to be an awesome mechanic but late game everything is cursed which hurts you but never your enemies. You can dispell it at great cost but it doesn't matter because the next time an enemy bleeds everything is cursed again. You constantly lose control of your party members to effects and when the AI controls your party it always does the dumbest possible thing.  To make things worse the AI moves at a snails pace in combat meaning their turns take too long. When facing a large number of enemies I often just alt tab and look at imgur for three to four minutes and even then sometimes the AI still hasn't finished there turn.  If you love stories than you might like this but if you are anything like me, the combat and power crawl ruins any fun you might have."

47,Jimmy_Carter,218,3,0,2018-05-25,Not Recommended,175.8,"I think Steam probably needs a neutral option for reviews, this game being a prime reason why. The game was a solid experience through most of it, but faltered a bit in the last chapter. Throughout the first 3 chapters, I was so engrossed in the game that I tried to complete every single side quest. For the most part, I found the combat fun, inuitive and satisfying. However, as I said, the last chapter slows down a bit, and the ending... well without spoiling anything... it leaves a lot to be desired. I can see what the devs were going for with the ending, but it made me feel like most of the stuff I did was for nothing. On top of that, there are a number of other problems that got on my nerves throughout my playthrough(s). On a number of occassions, your characters are forced into unescapable dialogue, and the character that enters said dialogue is just the one that happens to be closest to the NPC. As a result of this, on several occassions I had to reload a save as options were locked off for me, because the character that was forced into the dialogue did not have the prerequisite persuasion skill or tags. Another major issue is that I found the game was somewhat linear, although it presents itself as open-world. Many of the encounters will be impossible until you reach a certain level, and as a result, I found myself having to ascertain a particular order in which to play the encounters, so that I wouldn't get trashed, and in my opinion, those defeats before I ascertained the order was not due to my skill level as at the point that I attempted them, my characters could barely make a dent into the enemy's armour or health. I also dislike the dev's decision to make you stuck with a set of companions. I would have liked to switch out my companions at will, instead of having to make my choice and go through the rest of the game with it. I didn't really have too many issues with bugs, but there were a few here and there. On top of that, the game has you go through questlines, and jump through hoops, only to find that no matter what you do, everything you did was pointless. One particular instance was a side quest during the final chapter. After going through several difficult encounters, because I didn't have a specific companion in my party, I could not continue the questline, and no matter what I did, the quest automatically failed. For the most part, the armour visuals in the game were not to my taste. I found many of them too exaggerated, especially the higher end ones, and felt that they felt out of place with the game's tone. A number of other reviews have suggested multiple playthroughs, but I wouldn't suggest that. I played through it a second time andI felt that the story mode didn't have much more to offer after a single playthrough, as the results and quests played out the same, and the only difference would be something along the lines of a three sentence difference. And it appears to me that the major consequences all stem from the mass effect 3-esque decision you make at the game's end. I'm sure the game master mode would be a lot of fun, if I could find 3 other people willing to buy a $55 game. Also, you'll find yourself at a disadvantage if you create your own character, as much of the content revolves around using one of the characters the game has picked for you. If you do, you'll miss out on a number of quests and events in the game, making the experience less enjoyable.   Ultimately, if you ignore the ending, and you are willing to deal with a lot of the problems present in the game, I would buy it on sale. But if you don't want to put in hours after hours just for a major disappointing at the end, I would spend your money elsewhere."

I've never felt so conflicted on my feelings and my ""yes or no"" answer but right now i really can't suggest anyone buy this game.  Why? Well.. it's kind of not finished. Sure you have an ending but... if you're a ""normal gamer"" then you're not going to get to it due to horrific game design that seemed to be untested.  Simply put, the first act is pretty ""okay"" it's fairly balanced but a little dull due to lacking abilities that are interesting. Then act 2 is pretty open, there is a lot hidden and a lot going on, the theme of the game shines. You get new skills, story development and a fairly (most the time) balanced game. Act 3 then becomes oddly rushed.. with underwhelming endings to story arch and bizarrely easy fights. It's not the worst thing ever but it did make me feel a little concerned the game was losing direction.  Then i hit act 4.... oh boy... act 4... i.. i'm not too sure how to describe the car wreck that is act 4. Simply put, you start act 4 at level 19. The bosses and most of the enemies are level 20, which doesn't seem like a big deal... until you realize that the difference between that 1 level in gear is around... 200-300%. Yes... your items double/tripple in effectiveness from a single level. Unfortunately... you can't hit 20 without doing a number of quests in act 4... which results bosses just instantly killing your entire party in a single shot. I had a look online to see what the MLG pro gamers had for advice. The answers? Pretty much abuse flaws in the AI or bad balancing that helps you. There's no actual fair way to play act 4, you're supposed to abuse the game in order to progress. It's not something i want to do because i just don't think that's very fun.  Act 4 simply isn't anywhere near finished or even tested. Not only is the balance an utter mess, but so are the quests. Gone are your multiple options and dialogue with other npc's about your situation. Everything becomes a very finite line you MUST follow. A guy who got married on this exact day wants you to murder his new father in law, the ONLY way to finish it is to do it. Not tell his wife, not to get the local ""police"" involved, not even to mention why in his basement is effectively 30000 tonnes of this worlds equivalent of nukes. Just no, you're selling a product as if finished when it's clearly not. When act 4 is cleaned i will happily change my review.  And yes i know, people will tell me to git gud in response."

199,Aisukurimu,24,12,0,2018-05-30,Recommended,595.9,"In short, this is a game of high replayability with an immensely immersive world.    Quests Quests are in one way or another, interrelated to each other, they are not shallow ""fetch quests"" and each one actually reflects a little bit about the world of Rivellon. Players are not required to complete quests in any certain ways as each path you take is considered progression towards the ultimate goal. There are also  multiple ways to approach a single quest, whether it is to be a righteous individual and not ask for reward; to be a villain who only cares for your own self interest; or having to choose between two evils knowing either choice will have undesirable sacrifices. You could encourage a man to not dwell on pursuing vengeance and be merciful, perhaps that man will not stray from his righteous path, but he might  lose something/someone else .    Gameplay In terms of gameplay, I was initially not a fan of turn-based combat, which is largely what this game is about. I was more accustomed to ARPG-like combat as seen in Diablo 3. However, I allow myself to give this game a try despite my dislike of turn-based combat. It was a good decision as I later found myself so engaged by the turn-based combat in this game. Combat in this game has  great depth due to abilities being able to interact with the game environment, like creating chain explosions by casting fire on a poison/oil surface; or electrocuting an enemy and stunning him because you've already pre-casted a water surface beneath him. What's more amazing is that the  combat AI also make use of these mechanics! The combat has great potential for a highly strategic approach and it is very satisfying to see your strategies in effect. After multiple playthroughs, I realised that there are so many possible approaches to a single fight, and sometimes one mistake is all it takes to bring the player down from an advantageous position that could ultimately mean deaths of characters or even defeat of the whole party (The combat AI is no joke on higher difficulties, really smart and makes really calculated moves, which made the game more fun for me).    General experience In terms of the general RPG experience, personally I think the game has a  good amount of both combat and dialogues/stories. Dialogues are fully voiced and occasionally amusing. NPCs' responses in dialogue actually depend on players' races. There are also ""tags"" which can be selected when creating a custom character, these  tags allow you to do certain things that other tags cannot. For example, a character with a Scholar tag can interpret ancient tomes and gain knowledge from it; whereas a character with a Mystic tag is able to use their own sheer will to repel evil presence possessing innocent people to attack travellers. There are also ""Origin"" characters, which are essentially characters that already have their own backgrounds in the world of Rivellon and by playing as them/recruiting them as companions, you gain access to their own quests that might sometimes  intertwine with other Origin characters' quests.    Conclusion These are my personal views on what makes this game great for me. There are more exciting features that this game has which I don't think a single review can contain. If you like RPG games that leaves you an empty space after completing it, this is one such game. And the price tag is definitely modest for a game this big."

While it is technically true the game is filled with customization options, story, branching choices, etc. it quickly overwhelms and loses the player. The game basically diahreas features all over the player for the first few hours of play time. At this point you may be wondering to yourself, this game sounds great what is this idiot complaining about? Aren't gamers always complaining about linearity and lack of features in RPGs? The problem with Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of quantity over quality. Despite the truly impressive amount of features in the game, I could not escape the feeling that they were all undeveloped and paper thin. It is hard to notice because the game is just so vast but it merely hides its complete lack of depth and structure with its sheer volume of things to do. Also, the writing is bad. Like, really, really bad. 75% of it sounds like it was written by a DnD rookie trying too hard to be a dungeon master. I felt a mix of embarrassment and insult at certain dialogue trees which you will quickly find for yourself. The game just could not grab me in the first critical 10 hours of the game. Worth mentioning is the multiplayer feature which is actually kinda cool. If you have a group of (patient, open minded) friends that like playing DnD type games, this game is for you. That being said, my friends and I tried it and lasted only an hour before we broke the game out of impatience and frustration to progress quicker.  I could not get into this game at all. It slogs along, compensates for meaningful depth with a plethora of skin-deep content, and the first few hours of the game are so slow, so ungripping, I lost all interest. Maybe you think the lack of structure and hand holding is a good thing. Maybe the concept of a game stuffed with as many ridiculous features you could think of appeals to you. Maybe the game is better if you can get further in, but you'd be a much more forgiving man than I."

33,No Karma,57,6,1,2018-06-02,Not Recommended,81.1,"**Spoilers Ahead** I was hoping this game would be a successor to Baldur's Gate series but I am really disappointed in the battle mechanics.  I wanted to really like this game and do really like the story.  It plays like the Baldurs Gate series game in scope and detail.  The first Act is good but you can see the lack of AI tactics in the game at the start.  Enemies always have more armor and always have initiative.  Your characters always start out grouped together, making it easy for enemies to utilize mass damage abilities.  Additionally, in later acts enemies always spam with charm or Necrofire (fire with curse) before you get to do anything as they, again, always have initiative.  After Act III the game isnt fun anymore.  Other reviewers saying the game is easy or you really need to use tactics really do not understand what tactics mean.  The tactics dont change if every single battle starts with you losing initiative and being spammed with the same two spells over again.  The only way to counter this is to spam the same two spells back at the enemy.  This is not tactics, its just rinse and repeat game play. As to the professional reviews, thanks for reviewing only the first Act and not the entire game.  Cause if you did, you would be frustrated by the battle mechanics as everyone else who has attempted to complete the story.  The end game Acts are the most frustrating of all, as you are supposed to be this all powerful chosen one only to have every enemy be more powerful then your god like characters.  I can see the main protagonists as being the same or slightly more powerful then your characters, thus presenting a challenge.  However, even the supporting peon characters have more (sometimes double) the armor and power as your characters.  This is even if you have artifact equipment and 15+ skill in your primary abilities.  I would not have purchased this game knowing the AI was so bad and bugs still werent fixed as of June 2018.

20,Zant,142,139,15,2018-06-03,Recommended,175.7,"I cannot recommend this game enough. It is an RPG that breaks the boundaries of what you perceive an RPG to be. Every problem or puzzle has what feels like more solutions than you can conceive of. Original Sin 2 rewards clever thinking, tactics, and the role-playing itself over all else. Stat building and creating the ""perfect character"" is always a fun aspect of CRPGs but I'd say it's not the main focus here. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of numbers and plenty to min-max, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much damage you do if you're not in combat, and the game truly shines when you can avoid it.  Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is fantastic. You can control all of your (up to 4) party members individually outside of combat and prepare the upcoming battlefield to your liking assuming you have the drop on your opponents. Place your archers up top, give your wizards ample space, have clean terrain for your warriors, e.t.c. However, when you find yourself able to circumvent combat, you'll be rewarded with a level of satisfaction very rare in games these days.  It constantly feels like Original Sin 2 almost dares you to break the game's boundaries. It challenges you to out-think the developers. Everything matters in this game. I'll leave you with an anecdote:  As I explored, searching for a quest target, I came upon a ruin. I saw a passage through, but in between it and myself were a few foes I was most certainly not equipped to handle at my current level. In other games I'd probably have left and came back later when I was a higher level, but not here. I navigated around the edges of the NPCs' detection radius in stealth with each of my characters individually until I found a minuscule spot I could teleport to that would get me past my foes. It was certainly inconvenient, but it worked - I painstakingly teleported each of my characters in turn to that one spot only to realize the one doing the teleporting was stuck below; the one casting the spell is unable to use it on themselves. After some hard thought I realized I could place the teleportation artifact close enough for my previously transported characters to grab. I then used it to pull my last hero past the baddies. I exhaled a sigh of relief and then panned the camera to see I had just come face-to-face with the very character I had been trying to track down. I was positively oozing with smugness."

I love the story and I love this game, it's soo much fun to play, but jeez. The first two acts were fine, crashed every once in a while but not we're on act four and literally every time he saves the game freezes and it says ""Error: Connection to host lost""  It's too annoying to give this game a positive.   EDIT: If you plan on playing this game alone its fine, loads of fun and I would strongly recommend it.  Also apparently it crashes only while someone is engaged in something, be looting, talking, whatever. We turned off autosave because it would crash at the beginning of every autosaved fight and now we're saving only when we are standing still for like 10 seconds.  Act one was perfectly fine and had no issues, act two crashed very rarely, act three it got quite common and annoying and act four it was just every save, and he saves the game A LOT. It quickly became annoying and having to be reinvited to the game every 2 minutes made it game breaking for both of us."

106,Sgt. Steak,122,79,5,2018-06-11,Recommended,147.6,"ForenoteI apologize if this review doesn't appear as crisp as others on this page, as I don't write them often. That said, I feel this is one that absolutely warrants doing so. I'll attempt to spare you copious amounts of gushing in favor of clearer, more concise points as I go, though you should be aware that I've always had a weakness for games like this. Your mileage, as it will in all things, may vary.   Positives Craftsmanship: Excellent! Clear attention to detail and passion funneled into worldbuilding. There is a lot to see, hear and learn in Rivellon, and you'd be amazed at where and from whom this knowledge comes from.   Character depth: Glaringly flawed in some areas, but otherwise great! Whether pre-built avatars or enlisted as companions in the game itself, the game's cast of characters is unique and brimming with their own motives, thoughts and ideas. Likewise, those you do take with you aren't just along for the ride, and will actively attempt to make an impact on your adventure.  Nuance and Build Variety: Excellent! Anything is possible (within some very loose limitations) provided you're willing to work to put it together.  Gameplay: Good! Turn-based strategy type combat similar in nature to XCOM, with some departures in the form of such things as character-specific initiative. Larian's systems have a few issues, though, and a fair number of them can be really, really frustrating to deal with.  Story: Great! Not the most amazing story I've experienced, but definitely worth the time. It doesn't pull punches, and if nothing else, it is profoundly immersive.  Graphics: Excellent! Far above and beyond what is often expected of this genre, and despite the abundance of particle effects and bodies on screen, it runs smoothly to boot.  Soundtrack: Fair! Nothing to write home about, sadly. It can absolutely set up a mood, but it never struck me as anything I'd carry with me beyond the game itself. Negatives Equality of Companion Storytelling: Not every character was written equal, and it shows. Some have little to no impact on the story overall, while others quite literally change the perspective of everything going on. Taking those that land in the former category invariably trades interesting character dialogue, interations and bonding for what has the potential to be some of the more interesting tid-bits about the lore, important figures and what-not.  Gameplay: Inconsistent autosave mechanic makes it easy to lose hours of progress if you're not particular about saving over and over again. Items acquired during that lost time are not guaranteed to exist upon a reload, nor will they have the same stats as the game rerolls everything you do not presently own each time you reload. Initiative can be annoying and it creates opportunities for more powerful enemies to murder a member or members of your party before you can even act, if you aren't careful.  'Endgame': I feel no shame in admitting Divinity's stronger moments are in its first half, where you're getting to know the world and the people you're traveling with. A lot of crazy, fantastical things happen, but it all serves to further motivate you to seek out the real and honest truth. Sadly, however, a lot of the payoff isn't quite as stellar as I was hoping it'd be. In an effort to keep from spoiling anything, I'll clip this bullet with: Some of the final decisions can feel a little forced, and as resolutions approach, it becomes painfully obvious that, as above, not all companions and characters were written equal. Overall Divinity, in spite of what are ostensibly minor flaws (with the exception of some of the story-related notes), is a game that I wholeheartedly reccomend if you're a fan of the top-down dungeon crawler/RPG style of game. It has a lot of heart, and the world is very well put together. While there are some inconsistencies, some painfully overt 'nyah nyah' moments with the game's villains, and a general undertone of slight predictability to its story, it pulled me in and got me hooked on all the little details it had to offer. My only major gripe from a roleplaying standpoint is how... well, for lack of a better word, weak some of the resolutions are. At best, it can feel a little forced and at worst, some of the endings to several of the arcs in my playthroughs struck me as outright betrayals of everything that had been built up. In an effort to avoid spoilers (beyond what little I already have), this is something best experienced and decided in person.   As for gameplay, Divinity offers a rather open-ended system that can be tweaked and paired in a vast number of ways. It helps keep combat engaging, and it offers a great deal of replayability, as there are always new ways to try tackling different situations. That said, it has some very serious flaws that I found somewhat stifling, not the least of which being encounters with tougher enemies with a party that wasn't solidly invested in high initiative scores. Others, such as strange inconsistencies with line of sight, action points and other integral mechanics were certainly noticeable, but hardly game-breaking. Not much of a change from the first game there, I'm afraid.  In all, I'd rate this a 4/5. I would have been comfortable paying more than its asking price for the experience I got."

163,linkerError,832,3,1,2018-06-18,Not Recommended,8.2,"tl;dr: you already know whether or not you want to buy this.  A few improvements to the original, but still makes all the same mistakes as the original did. If you liked the original, by all means, take the dive. But if you found the original frustrating, boring or hated the scavenger-hunt style of quest design, you will find nothing has changed. Expect lots of vague objectives and wandering around aimlessly for hours at a time whilst waiting to stumble on the solution to quests. Saving and reloading the game is the primary progression mechanic and the enemies in this game will routinely wipe you out instantly on anything but the easiest difficulty setting.   I recommend you avoid this game unless you're personally pretty sure you'll like it. It is meant for a certain type of gamer (ones pejoratively dubbed 'The Commentocracy' by game critic Jim Sterling) and I am not one of them. That said, it's likely everyday folks might eke out some extra enjoyment from the excellent co-op mode, which is the only feature that makes these games worth buying imho -- having a friend along dulls the impact of the terrible design issues the rest of the game has. Or maybe misery loves company.  Despite having everything going for it in practically every other way, the godawful quest design turns what would otherwise be an exceptional PC RPG into a miserable slog. Avoid unless you think you can cope with these issues."

Here's mine: Beautiful game with a lot of potential for modders. Most of the game I was annoyed and waited when the fun part starts and it never did. Story and it's ending was not interesting, Lohse was the only one that made me emotional (mostly because of the song), everything else was somewhat basic and hollow. It was just my own expectations but I waited there to be good humor like in D:OS 1. There was nothing funny in this game, lots of intestines and exploded monsters on the streets at the end and no one even joked about the ""gore"".   Spirit vision should be 'on' most of the time or you'll miss a lot of information, even necessary. Crafting was dull,??????loads of material but nothing else useful but scrolls and basic potions to do. Runes that enhance your armor/weapons can be placed only to some specific pieces and that pretty much settles what you are going to wear. Also most of the usefull or even moderately powerfull stuff to craft is available just in the last chapter because of drops, and it would not have been OP to have them earlier since the crucial drops are rare anyway.   Combat was boring and annoying and the best way (sometimes the only way) was to cheese the battle, even at the normal difficulty. Doesn't really make you feel that you ""git gud"". Also it became obvious very fast that when you see 4 enemies in the area, there will be at least 8 of them in the battle EVERYTIME.   I hated the physical+magical armor pools logic; if enemy has even 1 point of phys armor left, ie. knock down automatically fails and when there is none, it always succeeds, that system felt ""cheap"". Some sidequest lines seemed unfinished and left holes to the story (of course they were the ones that were interesting IMO). Skills felt very much the same no matter what skill line it was from; same??????in different package.   I think the biggest problem all in all was that there was too much of everything and nothing was made well enough, like an unfortunate compromise. I guess it's good/ok for most of the people but I'm not gonna play it again, in comparison D:OS 1 is now third time under completion. But hey!

These Origin characters can be your party members throughout the game, so I found it more insteresting to have my main character be self made.  The game really has a tabletop RPG (like Dungeons & Dragons) feel to it. You can really choose how you want to play. In most games, if you want to be a Jack of all Trades, you're a master of none. In this game, you're a master of all. Because the more skills you combine, the better results you get. For example, if you choose to be a Sorcerer, you can combine water with lightning or with ice. If you first use a water spell, the ice or lightning spell will have a greater effect on the enemy. You will be well rewarded for creativity.  It also has a tactical turn-based combat system. Even movement and placement is key in combat, as well as your (combination of) skills of course. It can take a little while to get used to, but damn, the combat is awesome. It's not like other normal turn-based game, where you obviously have a best skill to use every turn. It really requires tactical thinking, and it feels really rewarding if your plan worked in combat.  The roleplaying aspect is wonderful. Not everything has to be solved my combat. There are always multiple ways to solve things, even in side quests. Not only does your background matter, but also your race. Every background and race have multiple and different roleplaying options, even for the Origin characters, who also have unique dialouge options. Oh, and yes, there are romance options in the game as well.  The goal is to become a God, literally, but the biggest accomplishment is the journey. Yes, this sounds cliche, but you will really feel this after completing this game. Are you satisfied with the choices you made, to become a God? Maybe you can't even become a God, because of the choices you made. After completing this game, it really made me think twice about the choices I made in my journey and it's really magnificent if a game can do that for me.  I'm really grateful for completing this game. It was a wonderful experience and it has so much to offer, even compared to other modern RPGs nowadays. I really recommend this game if you like RPGs or games with tactical combat. Also worth noting: Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition will launch in August and is free for all owners of this game. So even if you're waiting for the that, get this one now and you'll receive the Definitive Edition later, for free!"

18,Bee,131,104,9,2018-06-24,Recommended,436.2,"After hitting over 400 hours in Divinity: Original Sin 2, I feel like I can finally review it in full depth.  The game is spectacular. It was everything I wanted from Original Sin and then more.   The quests are in-depth, and you feel the consequences of your character/race choices on top of the dialogue you pick. I've played four full playthroughs, and each one I was still finding things I had missed (and I'm sure I will find more in my next one). The story is just fantastic, I couldn't ask for more from a storyline. The game makes you want to read every little lore book and just learn more and more about anything and everything going on. And if you're an Original Sin fan, there's little pieces of lore left around everywhere for you to prick your ears up at and get excited about (and then some!).   Then there's the combat. It's fantastic. It's incredibly strategic in every aspect. Your first playthrough on Tactician will give you some good laughs at some of the difficulty you need to face and work around (this is a good thing! My boyfriend and I faced some extremely hilarious moments of trying to figure out a fight and failing miserably when we were learning the game, it was amazing fun). And then you enter the realm of searching out perfect gear, perfect min-maxing, perfect stats, and perfect combat. That, in itself, is the most enjoyable aspect of the combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2. You can hop from easier combat to the most intense combat the game offers, and it's all fun. I recently finished my solo Honour Mode, and it was definitely hard and an adventure and left me sitting during quite a few fights thinking out beforehand how I was going to handle them because even the smallest mistake can mess you up. I can go on and on about how amazing the combat is, but you really just need to delve into it yourself to truly see how remarkable it is. I can't find anything I enjoy as much as D:OS2's combat system anywhere else.  If you're looking for a game to literally lose yourself in for long periods of time, or to even play casually in your free time, this is definitely my go-to. This is just a masterpiece of a game, it's every fantasy and rpg player's dream come true. And did I mention the co-op is incredibly fun? Really, it's just a stunning piece of art.  Now, I have a great many pros for D:OS2, but I do have a few cons, and these are entirely subjective, and my own personal opinion.  I really don't enjoy the four-man party system. For someone like me, it's way too overwhelming managing four characters at all times, and I just don't like it. Because some best in slot gear pieces are unique and you won't find ANYTHING else with their bonuses on in the game (Second Skin, ihu), you're just sacrificing too much playing a full four-man. But that's from a min-maxing perspective, and probably not that important to others. The second part of why I don't like the four-man parties is because once you get a taste of the solid power of a Lone Wolf character, you really can't ever go back. Now this can be a good or bad thing. It gives the game a lot of replayable value, I'm about to hit my 5th playthrough and I'm finally needing to stray away from my babe Sebille ( ): ), which pushes me to pick other players to experience their stories.   With all that being said, this is definitely a game I recommend anyone to buy. It's amazing in every aspect. I absolutely cannot wait until the Definitive Edition either. And big, big props to Larian Studios for their choice to give the buyers of D:OS2 the Definitive Edition for free. Incredible company who listens to their audience. I can't wait to see what future games come!"

70,Skarn,397,55,7,2018-06-24,Not Recommended,121,"This review contains spoilers.  I'm an avid BD / IWD fan so i was excited for Divinity 2, after beating it, I can say that divinity has elements of a great game but has many fundamental problems that destroy the experience for a typical player, I played this game with my other half and I'd highly recommend not playing this game with more then a single player, I'll get into why later in my review.  Lets start with what makes divinity good: the story, lore, characters are all very rich, there is a lot to explore, every NPC is fully voiced and the world is beautifully crafted. There is a delight in finding hidden goodies and being rewarded for really taking your time to search through each area.   Divinity excels in and out of combat, and the first 2 parts (islands) of the game are a masterpiece. Fights are balanced and your party feels like they are able to handle most encounters without the game ever feeling unfair. There is fun to be had everywhere, NPCS are interesting to talk to and there are many off the beaten path quests that will make you laugh out loud, make you feel genuine sadness and sometimes infuriate you at a game character. Last but not least is the puzzle elements, there are some great small puzzles to be done as well as a handful larger puzzles that make you feel great for solving them.  As the first 2 parts (islands) are so well crafted it makes the cracks in the second 2 parts (islands) that much more obvious. The third part of the game is very story-lite and feels like filler, it was extremely tedious with some key story characters thrown in for good measure to make the story tick along. Combat for the first time in the game was incrediablely easy, there were no challenging fights and nothing that tested our group of merry adventurers, which was different to the first 2 parts. It's important to note that part 3 is filler for a point later.  Despite the above, the third part of the game is mediocre/boring but still playable. The fourth part of the game is however a train wreck. Many of the quests are linear, with no objective thinking, fights are not balanced with many ""HAH GOTCHA"" mechanics put in place, only a select few standout puzzles (which were all too common in part 2) and quite frankly there are so many things trying to happen at once that it's a bit of a mess.   The story in part 4 falls apart with so many elements chucked in place that the finale of the game for me personally was A) ruined and B) hollow, part 4 of the game suffers from filler content like in part 3, but to the extent that nothing is interesting, as a player I stopped caring about the objective i was being set because the game was throwing the kitchen sink at me, so much of the content had felt ham-fisted and boring compared to the finesse of part 2 that I'd lost all emotional investment in the game that the first two parts had worked so hard to build. The game had simply gone on to long for me to care anymore, it would of benefited from removing part 3, and overhauling part 4 to be better paced and run a longer length to create a grand finale.   Part 4 also suffers from the ham-fistedness in the difficulty department with fights ranging from silly easy to ""cheese""to beat for a party that was not power gamed on NORMAL difficulty. The final fight of the game, I had to make a different choice simply because 1 of the 2 options was ridiculously hard, just because the game would 1 shot party members 2 levels higher despite my party being okay through most other fights (other then a few that were obviously overtuned, I'm looking at you doctor.)  The above is further made worse with the biggest problem of all: This game is a buggy mess.  I understand that nothing works 100% of the time, sometimes a game crashes, sometimes a quest is bugged. This wasn't the case for me throughout Divinity 2, about half way through part 2 of the game, every time I played, I ran into one of the many bug related issues listed below, shattering my immersion and often garnering my frustration at the game.  Bug 1: Save games lagging & causing the game to crash for either myself or other player. Divinity 2 has a limit on how many saves it can create, eventually causing the game to have immense lag, you have to fix this by managing your saves... why? I'm not here to manage save game files, I'm here to hammer the quick save button incase one of the many quests bug out.. which leads me to....  Bug 2: Quest bugs, this happened so many times where a quest wouldn't trigger or close or have part X fire properly, meaning time would be wasted online to find a workaround or whether I could continue on with the game, I ended part 2 of the game with 4 side-quests still open because they simply ""didn't close"".  Bug 3: *MAJOR SPOILER*: Cutscenes don't work in multiplayer, the final cutscene of the game was not shown to me because I did not ascend, so whilst the other player got to see the cut scene we'd played over 100 hours for, i was left on the ship twiddling my thumbs waiting, RUINED the ending of the game for me, I've never been angrier at a bug.  Bug 4: Inventory becomming locked, so many times this happened, where the main characters inventory would lock and no longer allow me to access it, forcing a game restart, frustrating as the game takes 2 minutes to load, and a further 2 minutes to get the other player in, this happened every playthrough in part 4.  Bug 5: Non-party leader members don't integrate into story, probably the most immersion destroying bug is that during the game, some party members will ""step"" into the spotlight to have their say should the party leader let them, but the second players characters never do this other than in moments for those character core quest lines. Player ones ifan would constantly step in and dialogue but player twos red prince and beast would never interject in a conversation and thus felt like tag alongs rather than party members.  Bug 6: Spells not working, sometimes spells would not hit their target despite a clear arch to hit an enemy, often this would been we'd need to target a different body part or some such, without the character or target moving.. ridiuclous.   In summary, Divinity 2 has great elements but I think it's unfinished and very rushed in areas, it's in dire need of bug fixing and re-writes, I wanted to love this game but I couldn't be happier that I've beaten it so I can see the back of it, a frustrating experience in the end and a wasted potential for something that could stand shoulder to shoulder with the old greats."
246,Rassy,162,8,4,2018-06-24,Not Recommended,176.4,"Divinity is a fantastic game, but I can't give it a positive rating after the??????hand I was dealt in the final section of the campaign...    The ending was completely rubbish in a multiplayer situation    The game was amazing right through, I played it through with one of my mates and we went straight through the entirety of Arx with no issues.  Only main issue I can see with the game is that many puzzles and sections of the gameplay felt as though they weren't fluid and extremely unintuitive. Many sections required me to browse the wiki pages as I spent ages puzzling over them and couldn't figure it out at all.   ALONG WITH THIS    The journel was pretty unhelpful and didnt tell us how to complete issues. I'm not asking to be handed puzzle answers but having nothing to go on makes the whole situation drawn out and irritating to complete   Rescuing Arhu was a piece of??????mission, he spawned in extremely weakened and then was focused by Kemm and immediately killed, saving him was a nearly unatainable achievement.   Now...with my nitpicking aside...for the finale.   The ending obviously results in one of you ascending to divinity, however for multiplayer at least the ending is disappointing, not everyone is a loner who plays with 3 bots for a 100 hour campaign -_-  We spent forever fighting Braccus Rex and then we were treated to a tasty 1v1 where who ever got the first turn won. My friend won the fight due to turn based inconsitency and ascended.   As the loser, you are stuck on the sidelines. I didn't even get to watch the ????ing cutscene for ascension, I was just teleported to the lady vengeance and expected to twiddle my thumbs while the other gets to watch. It sounds nitpicky but when you have spent ages working through a long?????campaign you need payoff of some sort. I got nothing, no cutscene or anything.   The entire game rested on a fight that lasted 10 seconds and went to whoever got the first turn. That is stupid and I cant accept how brief it was.   Its a fantastic game but for multiplayer there are changes that need to be made to the final fight. It was a serious buzzkill."
409,Hagaroth,10,9,3,2018-06-24,Not Recommended,49.7,"So after about 40+ hours in a single playthrough of this game I got to the end and just quit. This was a slow build up to me quitting that started with the end of Stage 1 of the game. At the end of stage 1 it turned out that I had missed about 5-7 quests and 2 party members that I did not know existed or could have even been party members. So I had 2 less options in party members right off the bat. This is because in this game you have to go through the grueling task of talking to every single character, read every single book, click every single opbest that can be clicked, and read through every single piece of dialogue. However, doing all of those things is not rewarding at all. It's not like there are 5 objects to click and 1 of them leads to a quest. No, there are 100 objects to click and 1 leads to a quest, or rather a single part of a 20 long chain of quest updates before you can actually finish 1 quest.  The dialogue in this game is highly acclaimed by a lot of people as being in depth and complex, but it is not. Everything you say comes down to light side or dark side and there is no in-between. I started out the game reading every single line of dialogue and carefully considering every choice I made, until I found out that simply mashing 1 did the exact same thing 99% of the time that I wanted to do anyways.  Combat is slow and there is no way to speed it up. It is also boring because while the game's creators boast that there are so many skill options and build options (which to their credit there is), only about 3 are viable. I started the game on the middle difficulty and lost the second fight of the game 3 times. That should not be possible. So then I went to Google and found out that apparently I chose the weakest build. Yay! After getting the right build (and scaling down the difficulty to the lowest setting) I found out that combat was a simple ""if A, then B"" and then you win. Not very strategic. Even on the lowest difficulty though I found some fights taking over an hour to do, most of that time being spent watching the enemy move slowly and casting animations. Even if you love this combat style, it is so slow you will come to hate it.  Exploration is a must in this game, but it becomes really tedious. The quest updates are unhelpful and vague. Not even Morrowind vague like ""go southeast and the object is in the Cave of Whatever"". It is more like ""Huh, the object isn't here, we will have to find it."" Great, where do I start to look for it? Everywhere, is the game's response. Go everywhere, talk to literally everyone, and after 3 hours of that you just might find it, or Google it. I started the game loving the exploration, and ended it by just Googling everything because 40+ hours in a single gameplay, the vast majority of it was running around the same area I had been in before trying to figure out where to go next. That is where your time will go. Not exploring the wonderful world they made for you, but running around bored out of your mind because you just want to finish the quest and move on. This occurs for the main quests too, not just side quests. The side quests range from super easy to get through, with flags on the map telling you where to go, to forget trying to figure it out and just Google it.  Play time is boasted as 100+ hours of gameplay. Not really. If the game was as simple to follow as Skyrim and the combat about as quick, the game would be about 20 hours long. Instead of it being like that they make things purposefully difficult to find and follow and get through so that you have to spend more time. It didn't make the game richer for me at all, just boring.  Quests get worse and worse as the game goes on. All of the great stuff that you can do and how seemingly innocuous things lead to big quests are literally at the start of the game. That is because each quest has progression points until you finally finish it. That is all well and good at the start of the game where there are 3-5 things to do to finish a quest, but after the first stage of the game it becomes like 10-20 things you need to do to finish 1 quest, and each section of the game has 10 quests. The quests are also set up like the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Do A, which leads to B, and so on until you are done. However, unlike Witcher, doing A gives you no clues at all as to what B is. So each quest takes forever and a day to do, unless you just Google it, but then all of the fun of figuring it out is gone, but if you do try to figure it out it takes so long that it isn't fun anyways anymore.  Puzzles are scattered throughout the game, but they are Skyrim levels of ""Just Google it"". Basically the puzzles go ""hey, guess the 5 letter combination,"" so you try 1 combination, die, reset, try another, die, reset, rinse and repeat. Fun.  Story. The story is the same as every Elder Scrolls game, and Elder Scrolls does it better. Seriously, without posting spoilers, it is literally the exact same thing.  Overall I got so bored with the game that I just wanted to finish it. I got to the end, Googled what I had to do after 5 hours of running around, and found out that it was so tedious and downright stupid that I just called it quits."

257,Andijvie,32,2,0,2018-06-28,Not Recommended,299.4,"I've played and loved every title of the Divinity series so far and I've done so since the beginning. This is the first title that I didn't enjoy and didn't even finish. Why?  - The story and the characters are dull and too serious. It's lost it's sense of humor, making it just another fantasy RPG.  - It's too easy, even on the hardest difficulty.  - The elements are unbalanced. Water + aero is way way way more powerfull then fire + earth/poison. And physical damage is even more OP. A ""jack-of-all-traits-master-of-none""team just doesn't work here. This takes away variety in combat, making every fight feel exactly the same as the previous one. - Inventory management is a pain. - Lizards don't fit in as humanoid characters. I enjoyed playing undead though! - [FIXED] The final act is just plain boring. I couldn't finish it. Fortunately they're redoing the whole act in the DE.  - No Bellegar!!!!  (apart from a small reference on the starter island) and where are Zandalor, ZixZax and others? Only a companion from the previous game makes an appearance, but he's not very iconic to the series.   I wouldn't recommend this version of the game, but I have high hopes for the DE. I'll give that one another go and hopefully I'll find the immersion I'm looking for. :)  EDIT: Unfortunately DE didn't deliver what I had hoped to get from it. Technically they didn't fix any of the things that bothered me for pc and the combat is still imbalanced. I did start a new playthrough in DE, but didn't make it past half of Act 2. This means I haven't experienced the revamped final act, so I can't review that. One positive: they did make the story a lot smoother and they added a handy tutorial."

Everywhere I go there are elemental barrels - most of which seem to just happen to be where combat can trigger.  A giant crocodile can flick it's tail - throw some elemental thing at you (whatever it is), hit a barrel and suddenly your party explodes into flame.  A massive part of this game appears to be to show off the whole earth, wind, fire, etc - everywhere you go, fire, shock, poison, acid, oil, whatever.  Rinse and repeat - elemental rock, paper, scissors."

So is it good? That is the Question.    That all depends on what games you like to play.  On one hand its a third person RPG game that works on a lot of levels. It has serveral races and abilites etc. It has some depth of story and even characters that are good enough. On the other hand it is a game that heavily requires on the scroll of internet to get to the next part. The game designers have mistaken hard puzzles for just general player confusion. They put in completly random things that no normal player would ever guess so often you are left wondering what do I do next?? This is especially evident in the latter part of the game.   My other complaint would be that while you are allowed to make any character you want, unless you take the stats that make your chracter super uber powered you will never get anywhere in the game without cheating. Maybe this is just a weakness on my part for not having played Divinty 1? But still it goes against the entire RPG system they have created and allow you to use.     So if its on sale maybe? if not I think I would have to reccomend you pass this one up."

In this game you will spend A LOTS of hours playing, trying, retrying, reading, discovering, stealing, hating some npcs, you will find some very nice plots.  The gameplay is really fluid, even for those whom dont like turned based games, you adapt with the system of fight in a time of an eye blink.   I need to say, GET THIS GAME, mainly if you are tha kind of player who likes the lore, believe me, this game have and awesome lore rich in details, i really wish they made another Divinty, surelly me and my friends would pre-buy.

489,The Edge of the Map,134,3,1,2018-07-01,Not Recommended,32.7,"Don't get me wrong the game is not bad and I'm not desperate for my money back. However, I can't reccomend this game when there are alternatives much cheaper and about the same quality,   First off it's very difficult for a new player. The game punishes you hard for things you couldn't be expected to know. For example there's an item you need to pick up right at the begining which is really easy to miss. I restarted 3 times and missed it every time. I only found out about it later when reading a guide.  Most importantly is the combat system. There's a lot of variety of things you can do. The big problem is the armor system. It makes having a mixed party of magic and physical damage much harder than having all physical or all magical. The fights are really hard. The enemies don't seem to scale very well but as soon as you get to the next level they become extremely easy. For example the first boss I spent 3 hours trying to beat at level 3, he was able to one shot my characters. I gave up, left and came back as soon as I hit level 4 and did it first time, easily. As I progressed the fights again became unwinnable to the point that I had to lower the difficulty level, something I never do. With the difficulty level changed the fights were then all far too easy. So the difficulty is either near impossible or no challenge at all.  If I could get a refund I would choose to take it but I'm not desperate. The game isn't bad but it's nowhere near the amount of hype it has got. I haven enjoyed it less than Dragon Age origins which is much cheaper."

Outside the bugs, that stop the progress of the game, the game itself has many moments in which you find yourself googling every next step as there's no logical conclusion to make.  Some videos for problems you'll find online have 100k+ views so it's just accepted that parts of this game are trial and error without much reasoning.   Going to try to get as far as I can into the game but with the bugs I doubt I make it much further, I'll probably have to kill a few key characters simply because they are bugged out and hope for the best.

287,Sgt. McSergeantface,85,9,1,2018-07-04,Recommended,237,"Why exactly you are reading reviews for Divinity: Original Sin 2? I doubt you were just browsing store. You were looking for RPG, dont you? Or maybe youve heard somewhere about this phenomenal game and just checking out. Or maybe you dont actually trust this unstoppable hype train, do you?      TL; DR. Buy. Play. Replay. Get Enhanced for free. Replay.     Well, every praised thing you might have heard about this outstanding game is 100% true. My life is now divided into before and after Divinity: Original Sin 2.   Larian Studios - creators of Divinity - is company of people, that actually works with players and for players. I will remind you, it is an indie project financed on a crowdfunding platform. Game has inherited all the best parts from previous instance. However, it is an understatement to tell that OS2 improved things. Sequel has added so much more, it has surpassed every existing game and doubled, tripled the level of todays RPGs, adding everything we didnt dare to dream about.   We want to choose playable races! - Ok, heres four. And you can make a playable undead character. We want more companions! - Fine. And they are living humans - play with three of your friends.   We want more magic and perks! - Here 4 more skill schools and mix them up to unlock more perks. We want to make love to our party members! - No problem. You also can punch em in a face anytime. We want personal quests! - Welcome playable characters with prewritten origins and their own story arc. We want more stories! - Heres Game Master mode and dedicated modding support.   Everyone knows, how much time it takes sometimes to create your character: skills, abilities, talents, etc. Eventually it took me twice as much, because I just couldnt stop admiring visual design of characters, feasting my eyes while scrolling different races and skill presets, to see as characters model switches his looks. In addition to looks and technical part of your avatar, there are two notable things in character creation. First, if you build your own character (not pre-created), you can add some personality traits, which together with race will reflect on your social interactions (i.e. dialog options). Second, choose one of four musical instruments - games musical score will dynamically change leading instrument, when your character does something awesome. Imagine epic cello or bansuri solo when your hero is unleashing some hell on pity enemies! More to this: do not bother with perfect build, try fresh ideas, experiments and bold choices - Divinity will allow you to change your specs midgame numerous times if you think youve messed up.   Combat system maybe the one thing that has changed heavily in sequel, a lot of things were reconsidered. For me personally it was hard to get used to changes right after first game, but in hours Ive found it even more satisfying. However, keep in mind that straightforward face punching still not the option. Tactics has moved into third dimension - do not underestimate high ground. And of course, dont forget to utilize everything you can reach, thats including you pockets and your surroundings. Found yourself standing fenced in a fire - use water barrel to extinguish it or bless fire and stand your fight in cleansing flames. Got bullied by a brute - teleport yourself out, or teleport enemys sorryeeeeeon lava. Some of most efficient tactics are those that not first come to mind.   Plot isnt connected to Original Sin. Sequel is provided with its own overarching narrative and several personal story arcs of origin characters (which also serve as companions) and particular factions. Everything is interconnected in some complicated manner, it was the reason of bugs and some general frustration, because one path leads to impasse on other story thread (fixed by further patching). However, game doesnt hold your hand and never questions your approach to advance the story. E.g., first thing you are tasked with after tutorial section - get out of concentration camp, and then you can look for someone to help you with this, help others for info on how to get out, murder your way out, lie your way out, or fly away, if you have the ability, without even meeting anyone. Plot progression is not just 3-4 options, but absolutely non-linear. Basically, you can roam where the wind blows the whole game, you will always find yourself on a right path.   World of Rivellon has changed. At first, after whole shiny hunky-dory previous game, it was tough to find yourself in a place that is harsh, cruel and mean as Wild West. People will lie to you, use you, and you absolutely will find yourself in"

While this made the fights easy-peasy (which also means they didnt give that satisfying sense of achievement each time), the story kept the play time enjoyable. I always looked forward to returning to it. If you want truly difficult, there is that option, too, and you can browse through the other reviews to get a sense of folks experience with it.  I also enjoyed customizing (and re-customizing) my characters abilities. The game is good enough that it opens a way to re-do your character as often as youd like fairly early on. This remains convenient throughout the rest of the game. So, I never felt like I had to agonize over a decision. I could always try some ability or characteristic choice and change it later if it wasnt working out.  I found it to be a great casual game!"

The story is, well, ahem, there. Did I mention the voice acting and the optio-... I did, huh? Anyway, it's all fine for the first few hours. You're exploring, the world is vastly, um, vast. The characters plentiful.   But then ""Your enemies are more powerful than you. Consider fleeing."" happens. A lot. This is a direct qoute of the game's interface, which actually and directly *tells* you that the given area/encounter/fight/building/quest/blahblah/yaddayadda will get long, tiresome and frustrating. And man, does it happen often. On CLASSIC friggin difficulty. Get ready to be OHK'd a lot. Every 'boss' encounter is a few levels above you, unless you grind every single quest.  And here lies the conundrum (wrappen in an enigma (wrapped in a pastry (wrapped in a 'whyohwhy'))). Theenemies  world may be open, but your choices are *not*. Want to ventrue this way, on a whim carry-me-game-world-oh-you-open-and-free-beast-you? Nope, enemies outlevel you, you die. Want to skip running every errand in this town and continue your oh-so-mother-of-all-epicness-epic-quest? Nope, you have to talk to everything and do everyone (err, or the other way around). Because at level 10, enemies level 12 spell doom (with a capital D, capital O, capital YOUWANTMORE?). This happens constantly, meaning that for every larger fight you need a plan, a trick, a five-barrels-of-cursed-oil-in-your-inventory contingency.  It just gets tiresome.  If you have the 10 hours a day to spend on a video game, good for you, have fun. If you don't, you'll be playing this for weeks, one fight at a time, getting smashed by a 1000HP-250DMG-per-hit-voidwoken vs your 100-armor crew.  There's still a complex, large, ambitious, no-hand-holding-making-you-think game under the 5-boss-fights-per-area aggravation.

Enemies will often have more health or armor than their level or stats should allow and will often get advantages such as extra AP and impossible ability cooldowns. this gets really annoying when you watch an enemy run at your mage from 30 feet away before attacking them three times (at 2 AP cost each). This scenario isn't even uncommon. What's worse is when the game spawns extra enemies in mid-battle. This wouldn't be a problem if there were any warning that this was going to happen but that's never the case because the game will often spawn in several enemies at a time and give them each a turn immediately. This can happen multiple times per battle meaning that, completely out of your control, a bunch of enemies spawned in and nuked you. This leads many fights to feel like the Braccus Rex fight from the first game, not hard but stupidly unfair for no good reason. I imagine this was the developers way to try and combat save scumming but what ends up happening is you need to save scum more simply because the game expects you to know in advance what its going to do. This gets so bad that I've seen entire fights go by without even moving: The enemy will get first turn, summon baddies and stun the entire party, making you helpless as the others pick you off one by one. This is bad fight design.  All in all, I like this game but am extremely disappointed in the way its encounters were designed. I don't want fights to be easy but I want to know that the enemies are playing by the same rules I'm confined to or at least similar ones."
192,Szkeptik,216,7,4,2018-07-16,Not Recommended,54,"As awesome as most of this game is I just can't recommend it because of the all-over-the-place difficulty it has. I play it on ""Classic"" difficulty (I guess it's supposed to be ""normal""). You might have a completely fun and interesting fight in one room, then move to the next and find yourself facing enemies with 3x more health and 2x more damage than your party have. They will often move first as well, and by the time the turn comes to you, your party is at half health and crippled/blinded/etc. I don't know if the devs intended these fights as a deterrant from higher level areas, but there's no indication that you are coming up against and unbeatable foe.   Not to mention a bunch of times the enemies will teleport in from nowhere with a proximity trigger like mechanism, so you can't even sneak up on them or know what you will be facing until you walk right into it. Even if you can somehow beat them, you can't do it immeadiately, but only after a couple of reloads when you already know exactly where they will spawn and what abilities they will use.  My personal assessment is that the level design was kind of sloppy when determining level progression and opponent difficulty. It's like you are always a level too low to face the next challenge and have to constantly backtrack to try and find some better gear or farm more XP in previous areas so you can progress.  I read that the solution is to itemise well, but the drops and market items are random, so you may or may not get the good stuff early. And if you don't you might as well start anew or reload some older save and try again because you will not be able to take on key fights. It reminds me a bit of the HoMM games where even on moderate difficulties you basically had to play a perfect game to have a shot at beating the AI.  All in all, unless you are some veteran RPG fan I'd definitely wait for a discount."

I used cheat engine in some parts --it doesnt contain spoilers, obviously-- Remember that in all my playthrough I looked forward to use the least ressurect spells that I could, because they are pretty expensive to buy and steal. This is very important on the criticism that I have  The story seems to be nice and it revives aspects and character from the first game (which is not required to play in order to understand this one), and certain things that bothered me in the first still continues on this game, like the little lore things being only explained by the books, traps in ridiculous places (like under a sinked boat. A sinked boat&.) and the unclearance of ---certain--- quests, I say it cause the first game didnt give you at all, sometimes you selected any random dialogue cause you get bored by the voice of the character, the way she speaks or even cause she speaks too much and even tho you can still do it, the journal and the map helps much more  The skills are better to learn, requiring you to just level up your memory in the attributes menu instead of levelling a skill to its maximum to find out that you can only learn 3 master skills like in the first game. Also, there is no distinction over the rank of a skill, a skill is just a skill like its supposed to be.  The traits are now a dialogue option, but you dont get them so easy and as far as I played I only get hero, not even giving me bonuses for my conducts  The beginning of the game leaves you stranded on the island youre supposed to get with only the items of the class that you chose, and it stays like that for pretty much the rest of the day. And I mean it, at the end of the day (if you get immersed in the history and the dialogues) you will find yourself wearing the same clothes, cause is hard as hell to get money to buy things for your characters and you only start getting things after lvl 5 or so. But dont think my complains make no sense, cause it takes some time for you to get there and actually nice items are only in act 2 forward   You got to choose neo, rather this armor go to this fighter or this knight. At the end of the day someone is going to die anyway&. Jokes on you for buying resurrect scrolls!  Oh but I can pickpocket No. just, no. you can only pickpocket NPCs once for character. I couldnt find a reason for that cause you can get high amount of money in late game, which translating is about 15 hours to 30, if you dont take a thievery skill right at the start youre eeeeed up, the next point in civil abilities will be only at level 2 (it means a simple fight at the beach), then 6 or something. If you want a thief in your crew be sure to skip all combats as soon as you get to the island and ask Sebille to join you (at the south, right before the sand next to the doctor)  If you pickpocket someone to get items at the beginning, you wont be able to do it again for the rest of the game with the character chosen. This game is all about choices, a full dps character? A dirty thief? A support mage? A tanker? Should I get this skillbook that my party really need or this chest armor that my warrior need in order to keep eeeeees away from the source of damage? Cause I dont only have WHEIGHT limitations over what I can steal, I also have VALUE AT THE SAME TIME. Of course it upgrades, but till that point is 20 hours of pain in theeeeeeand in the back until you dont even need to pickpocket anymore    Thats why I dont used to pickpocket resurrect scrolls  But why all of this items matter? I can be polite and educated, and thus, avoiding battles! Youll have to battle sometime. And the battle changed for worse, much much worse  DOS 2 adopted a system which you need to be pretty much a NUKE in order to crowd control or even kill someone.  You have armors now, which means that you can get a battering ram in your face and not get knocked down (if it dont break through you armor) and you can walk in fire without get burned, sounds good enough, right?

1137,Dr. Vodka,54,No,0,2018-07-19,Not Recommended,200.7,"I do not like it for a number of reasons despite having invested 200-ish hours into it.  To start off I generally don't like companion-oriented gameplay where you're given a few characters and expected to be overly attached to them. I seriously find them impossible to care about, why should I be interested in these people? A lot of characters feel contrived and unbelievable as-well, especially the dwarves and their Scottishness for some reason (I've been to Scotland and it feels extremely unnatural for everybody to have shrunken by two to three feet since my last visit).  There's too much exposition given to things and people and dialogue that I have to wade through, which is equally as brain-numbingly horrible. It wouldn't be so bad if I found the lore captivating in the slightest, but the game is littered with fantasy cliches. As-in not the occasional elf/dwarf/orc/whatever sprinkled about, it's built on everybody being a human or elf or dwarf or lizard and the protagonist being a chosen one and the world being threatened at the hands of darkness monsters.  Conversation is mildly fun but if you've not got persuasion you're basically doomed, and you can only really specialise in one thing (including persuasion) unless you want to be totally incompetent. It also becomes boring rather fast, despite the unique tags and whatevers.  Similarly, the idea of the Divine Order being horrible and depraved below the surface is unique, but it's rubbed in so utterly thick my brain just sighs and goes ""Yes, I know they're turning people into mindless husks, yes they're horrible and callous, yessir, yes anything you say"" whenever the fact decides to violently club itself back into obviousness as you see Divine Order Depravity No. 8000.  It's as though the game itself is conscious of its sheer mundanity. I hit the ancient civilisation bit and the architecture is literally geometrical, as though to say ""????, I can't be bothered to make any more countryside/forest/castle/tavern/dungeon anymore, why don't I just throw in a few granite shapes in a vaguely mystical looking fashion?"". The landscapes in-game are like what you'd get if you sampled British countryside in the middle of nowhere and injected a lot of rocks and wood and boats and Medieval-ish things.  You have to trudge through the borescape via teleportation and agonisingly light-paced jogging. Peering down on your little avatar. It's about as riveting as it sounds.  Then, there's combat! I advise you never attempt Lone Wolf (I.E. soloing) unless you truly want to multiply the tedium and horrific feeling of time-wasting emptiness tenfold. That is seriously not fun.  While I admire the tactical aspect of combat quite a lot, you will inevitably end up using your same strategy every time on a given character (to name a few of mine I have 'Dipping People in Oil and then Setting Them on Fire', 'Staying Invisible and then Teleporting Behind Somebody before Violently Gutting Them into a Bleeding Chicken with Ruptured Tendons before Turning Invisible Again' and 'Angrily Battering Somebody until you can Knock Them Over a Lot and Possibly Turn Them into a Chicken As-Well'). It becomes quite repetitive and dulls the planning aspect a fair bit, although I admit it can be rather fun, just not when it's tedious and long-winded.  There are hints of clicheness however, as I've found (personally) that a lot of abilities are rather common elemental things (fire/water, lightning, what have you) and you have generic ranger/assassin/warlord archetypes. I don't mind this however because it makes up for it with the more unique trees like Scoundrel, Necromancer and Polymorph (edgy choices I know, but I am somewhat fond of them), though I wish games would come up with more original ideas for magical abilities.  Overall, Divinity just feels like a very dull, empty and artificial experience that I am remorseful to have spent so much time on. Regardless though, I have enjoyed playing it with my brother. My main complaint is that it is too generic thematically, progress is too long and artifically stretched out, there are a lot of recycled assets and overall that it just doesn't have any spark or appeal that makes it feel special and like a lovely experience.  I have no clue why the game is held in such high regard, perhaps nowadays if a game is deemed functional and able to ram as many mechanical and thematic cliches into one bundle it makes for a revolutionary experience.  Either way, I think I would find performing violent dentistry on myself with an oversized cleaver for several hours more unique, imaginitive, fun and enlightening than every single hour that I've spent on Divinity."

The gaming industry has been lacking super high-quality AAA games that simply tried to create the best possible game in its respective genre - without trying hard to cash-grab and overly cut costs where you really shouldnt. The reception of Witcher 3 simply showed how starved consumers are for such quality-games.  Divinity Original Sin 2...  The game looks absolutely gorgeous. Stunning islands, stunning characters, amazing colors - a feast for the eye.  The universe the developers created is interesting and overall excellent and suits the genre perfectly by adding that extra touch of insanity and therefore supporting player-choices which, quite frankly, are going to be insane more often than not.  The ""R"" in RPG? Delivered.  Replayability - The game often delivers a lot of significant choices how you can influence the world around you and a ton of ways to solve (or terribly mess up) the things you encounter.  Innovation - Modding-support needs to be counted for this one. You can create adventures, mod the base game and even have a complete game-master mode. Features like crafting are an interesting touch for such a game, but can be entirely ignored if youre not into that. Spoiler, if you havent watched the trailer yet:  You can speak with animals, if you pick a trait for that. That's absolutely incredible. Animals simply connect to us on a whole different level. Who wouldnt be touched by some poor, sad puppy eyes, even if its just a game?  The ground-effect based combat is also a nice touch with several connections to that.  The game is fully voiced and even has a narrator. If you really listen closely you can hear that not every voice actor was perfect, but come on, the game is fully voiced and I'm really nitpicky here. Can't hire the best voice actors for a thousand characters and have all of them perform on the same level.  I've got to criticise though that the multiplayer does not have a multiplayer-dialogue function. What I mean by that is that the first player who clicks on the NPC gets to do all the talking without the input of the others. Sure, you can punch each other in Teamspeak and start complaining about choices, but that's no fun. There's a PvP function in the game, but I dont really feel like that's the thing I'd like end up with when I start up a >Coop< session. There should be something like dice-rolls and whoever gets the highest rng, gets to say his line. Something like SWOTOR?.

99,przemekk834a,101,32,11,2018-07-30,Not Recommended,384.7,"Well, after playing this game a lot I decided to write a review (although I do not usually do it) and give it negative score, although I must admit that it's maybe a bit too harsh. This game has its qualities. Especially on the arts side (music, graphics, the world design, etc. ) it's simply marvelous. It also has deep, complex combat system, that in theory looks awesome. But not in practice -- more on this below.  Many criticisms of this game boil down to simple statement: Explorer mode is much too easy, but Classic mode is way too hard. There is a lack of ""sweet spot"" in difficulty between the two. But I do not think this is really the problem. I've beaten it at Classic and got as much fun as frustration and annoyance during that. So there isn't a problem with difficulty, but rather irritating game design mistakes the developers made. A few examples:  - The AI cheats and certain mechanics are unfair. For example, there is a Charm spell which makes enemies to fight on your side for short time - but enemies also can use it on you. When enemy charms you, AI takes away the control from you over your character but if you charm the enemy, the game will not give you the control over them. And the AI behavior differs. Charmed enemy characters frequently just skip turns or flee, while your characters will either attack your party, or senselessly waste your resources (potions, scrolls, SP). This is obvious cheating. Similar problem is with Taunt ability.  - The game tries extremely hard to be ""physical"" in restricting your casting and ranged abilities. The target must be in sight, the path must not be interrupted, etc. This looks cool on paper, but really leads only to some tedious gameplay. Isometric perspective is not convenient to judge spatial relations like this with required precision and you constantly are forced to adjust your position by trial and error - but every movement costs action points. So you must frequently save and reload if movement result is not right. Basically the only effect on gameplay of this ""cool mechanics"" is forcing save/reload scumming. ""The Pawn"" talent fixes it, but consumes one talent slot which are very few. This should be enabled by default. In addition to the above, terrain navmeshes are buggy and often the game thinks the path is blocked although visually it is not.   - This game loves to give unpleasant surprises to the player. A conversation with some innocently looking NPC often leads to a fight with half dozen guys who appear just out of nowhere. Solution - save, reload, cheese. Position your team away, send one to talk, during conversation teleport him back, finish conversation - now you have fight started on your terms. Definitely doable but extremely anticlimatic and immersion breaking.  - Teleportation is OP and too easily spammable. This leads to irritating situations when you waste time to position tactically your team, but enemy AI just decides to spam Nether Swap / Teleportation and shuffle you around so that you are in deep sh*t again.   - So called ""diablo loot system"" with gear leveling - everyone seems to hate it but game devs still push it into their games with no reason. Forces you to replace your gear every level or two. No way to upgrade.  - Not much sense of progress of your characters. You level up, but meet higher level enemies constantly and you are always a pushover, unless you find adequate gear for your level. Source magic is totally underwhelming - except ""Dome of protection"" and some high-tier spells that you can get only near the end. You never feel like a powerful Sourcerer you're supposed to be, but just some weakling trying to survive.  - Too hard, unbalanced fights are being offset by cheesy countermeasures like ""Dome of protection"" mentioned above or resurrection during battle. Resurrection scrolls are prohibitively expensive in the beginning and very cheap near the end. You can easily stock up on dozens of them and with help of ""Morning person"" talent make yourself almost immortal.   - Many UI problems and omissions. Movement of your team during map exploration is terribly slow - there is no ""fast mode"" like in PoE games. Chaining / unchaining by dragging portraits is awkward - having a ""chain/unchain all"" button would be nice, but there is no one. Inventory management sucks (as in all games in this genre), with so much gear management required it is a major hassle. Lack of ""sneak/unsneak all"" command. Edge panning is triggered even when you are using scrollbar in the inventory. No way to list inventory by name (how the hell that blackroot plant looked like?).   - In a game which forces you to save scum and reload all the time, you will often see the loading screen. In in this case it is absolutely terrible. Even longer than in PoE, and although does not appear during map exploration (full map is loaded), frequent reloading due to trial & error gameplay will make you hate the loading screen very quickly.  I could list a lot more issues, in fact there are tens of them and this review would be very long. Each of them separately is not that big, but as a whole they generate a lot of annoyance and you start to lose patience after a while. And this game is very long. Normally that would be a good thing. Content creators did a fantastic job, preparing so much amazing content. This game is worth its price just because of that. But what is the use of it all if playing the game gets frustrating and tiresome after some time spent with it?  So why am I NOT recommending this game? Because it stole away lots of hours of my time, but did not give me as much fun and satisfaction as I hoped for. I kept playing because I was hoping that the game would get better at later stage, or maybe after leveling up or respecing the team (I experimented a lot). But it never did really."

The game is amazing until you get to the end. The game all of a sudden wants to throw weird puzzle mechanics that just don't fit with the flow of the game. They are also really annoying. Some boss fights don't follow the combat mechanics but yet your party does. The bosses do like 10 things at once and get back all of their AP (action points) on their next turn. If you played it on lone wolf, then you are able to do it too, but reccommended for advance players. My last warning before you buy this beautiful game is that the game still has bugs in it. There are many quest that can glitch out resulting in you not getting the xp or the award for completing the quest. There is a large list of them and you can google them when the time comes. I only had the one quest bug on me when i played through the game. Others had at least 10 + quest bug out for them. Worth it to the very end."
35,Riptide,57,248,8,2018-08-04,Recommended,195.5,"After playing this game for a few weeks, I can say that DOS2 has replaced Skyrim as my all time favorite RPG. It's that good.  Pros: Voice acting, graphics, ""turn based"" combat, immersion factors all get a solid 10. I haven't finished the game, but so far the story is interesting, and even if the story ending stinks, it still has that draw you in factor. As for re-playability, it's already apparent to me that I'll have to play it again with the other available characters so I can experience their stories. There is the main story line, and each of the 5 pre-created characters have their own stories. I chose to create my own character, which means I have 3 of the 5 available pre-created characters as my compatriots, each with their own stories to be completed. With my current playthough, I'm not going to know how Sebille or Lohse's stories finish out. They're not in my party so, I gotta play again with them to find out how their stories end.  An EXTREMELY well crafted RPG. This one is a clear and unmistakable winner. Kudos to Larian for self-publishing to avoid the pressure to release the game before they completed what they intended the game to be. You guys got it correct.  Although I'm not a fan of third person, overlooking the party, view point games (I prefer first person... eyeballs forward),  this one succeeds in grasping my attention and refusing to let it go. I'm drawn in, focused, worried, and sssso happy when a fight is over and all the characters under my control are still alive, I'm almost bouncing up and down in my seat ready for the loot.   It's a blast to play!   The only downside I've felt so far - and it's not really terrible - is inventory management. There's a load of stats, and as with any RPG, we all want all the stats to be as high as possible. Well, it ain't gonna happen. There's the agonizing struggle around applying the puny number of level up points to a plethora of possibilities. And, the loot that's uncovered has a variety of statistical applications that can be distributed to... well... do I want this? Who best to give it to? Arrrrgh! I like those extra points with that, but this one has these two stats.... which one to choose? Maybe I could give it to this character... but then I lose those stats. Grrrrr! Maybe I should keep it for later on? No. Maybe I'll just sell it. No... should I wait? Maybe it'll be useful in this situation? What... ever.... should.... I... do??? **blank it*** I'll just sell it. No, I'll keep it for later. ARRRGH!!!  It's involved, at times frustrating, and can be overly time consuming. There's so many items that can enhance a variety of disparet statistics, it can be overwhelming. It's like a 20 page menu of delicious food at a great restaraunt to a starving man. I WANT IT ALL!!!  I've always been of the opinion that less is more. This game does not embrace that. There's a lot of items, that do a lot of different things, and I've probably spent more time trying to figure out who should get what, for the maximum impact, than I've spent exploring.  I'm not really unhappy about that though. For me, it's at most a minor annoyance. There is a crafting mechanism that I could take a deep dive into, which some people will do because they like exploring that type of mystery. Me? I try not to be an item hoarding ?????, but ultimately I lose out on certain discoveries. But hey, it's all good y'know? I may miss out on a side quest here or there, but there's too much other content to discover so even though I've ""broken"" a few side quests so far, I've forgotten about them so I just press onward with the quests that are currently before me.  Let me put it this way: Inventory management can be tedious, but if you ""explore"" it, certain items can open additional quests. Sheesh! As if there wasn't enough to do already!  Oh, and if you put a point into Pet Pal, you can talk to the animals. Which open up probably a few dozen side quests to have fun with. I mean, why wouldn't you? There's only a hundred quests along the way, so why not open up a few dozen more??? Awww... go on! You got the time!  This game is easily worth the current price of around $40. My favorite gaming experiences have been with RPG's, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now my favorite of all time.  Well done Larian!"
329,johnqwilson,60,2,0,2018-08-04,Not Recommended,123.3,"I really wanted to like this game. I love Divinity: Original Sin--the original. Not the Enhanced Edition, but the original was 10/10 for me.And I do grant that D:OS 2 is beautiful, has a very wide variety of interesting skills, great skill combination possibilities, and it is obvious this was a massive effort to put together.  But.   There are four problems I have with this game:  1 is the lack of crafting. In D:OS original, most of my end crafted equipment was superior to any dropped item. My craftworks didn't have all of the properties of top drops, but for what I wanted to do, my crafted equipment fit my strategy. Life was good. In D:OS 2, crafting is useless. Why bother stockpiling loot? Crafting is one of the joys of any D&D Style game, and it is sorely missing here.  2 is that combat is boring. D:OS 2 suffers from the same problem as Dragon Age II. The only way to get through toughest tier combat is to play each battle multiple times, memorize the spots where enemies spawn, and position in advance accordingly. Or, watch a video that shows spawn points and positional tactics for that battle. This is a horrible approach to combat. D:OS original had some very tough fights that required real strategy to survive. D:OS 2 requires no strategy, just watch a video for each fight, position as the video does, use the same spells, and the fight becomes almost too easy.   3 is the insane power spike of each level. A level 16 fight is impossible for a level 15 party, and piece of cake for a level 17 party. This makes the game too linear, with little freedom to explore, and the only real way to tell the right order to do things is...watch walkthrough videos! In D:OS original, I rather liked having my lvl 6 party take on lvl 8 char-boned archers. In D:OS 2, this is not possible. Your level provides huge differences in base stats, the stats of any equipment you buy, etc. It's too much.  4 is the lack of any engaging story. D:OS 2's story feels like an afterthought. In D:OS original, there was real character development, truly original twists and turns, and I was left with an inspired fantasy of something that felt like it could have really happened. D:OS original had a Silmarillion-esque quality about it, or the AD&D descriptions of the nine hells and seven heavens. D:OS was interesting reading/watching on its own right, to really contemplate an alternate theory of cosmology and the universe. D:OS 2 tries to copy the same story pattern, but there's nothing really interesting about it. D:OS 2's story ""reads"" like a typical Choose Your Own Adventure book.   So...there you go. I almost feel bad, because a lot of people put a lot of time into this. But most of what made the first game special, is missing in this. Spell combinations is probably the most interesting thing about D:OS 2, and it really is impressive. But for me, that's not enough."
96,"Sir Kirby, the Radio Pheasant",105,39,2,2018-08-05,Recommended,187.2,"This game is as close to 10/10 as possible: There are plenty of encounters that play off each other, and impact that can be had from simple interactions you might not think much of. The amount of interplay from this game is absolutely amazing, and I'm almost certain you can have hundreds of hours and still miss some really small nuanced things in the game.  I came into this game never having played the first, and I still absolutely loved it. Single player is completely awesome, even if a bit more work, but if you have a group of friends to play this with? All the more awesome.  The following review is spoken without ever touching modding, or anything beyond the base campaign.  Some complaints that you should be on the lookout for: -Grasping the spell interactions can be a bit steep when starting out for mages. (For instance, you may poison your undead tank to heal them, and then hit them with a spell called Fortify which can remove your heal) -Sometimes, you can be roped into conversation with a character who isn't your pursuasion char, and then be forced to spill spaghetti and rope your team into a fight -Line of sight will 9 times out of 10 kill you, and you can only cry a single tear as the NPC sometimes snipes you through solid walls -Spell mileage will vary greatly from the player to the computer (a charmed/taunted npc may cheese out their turn, where you will seemingly always be forced to do something absolutely silly and try to kill yourself) -Whenever your characters are charmed/taunted, they *will* absolutely destroy your inventory full of consumables (though they will *always* use your rain scrolls first) -In later levels, with lots of particle effects and interactions, the computer may take quite a bit of time in deciding their turns -Sometimes, depending on how good your computer is, you can have a very unstable game -Some playstyles aren't quite viable. (For instance, a battle mage is ""possible"", but not really ideal, as you end up splitting damage over physical/magical resistance, which makes Crowd Control nigh impossible, as the real damage from physical/magical spells comes out when you are hitting their Hit Points directly) -Spirit vision (a thing that lets you talk with ghosts) is great from a lore perspective, but it can be easy to forget how versatile it is if you're not actively thinking about it; and if you're actively thinking about it, you pretty much have to spam it and walk across the world hoping you don't miss a fun little lore tid-bit. -Some fights are just straight up brutal if you don't quite know what's going on, all I can say is don't be afraid to google a bit of help if you're really struggling  Despite the complaints above, those really are just minor inconvinences which you'll have from time to time. Think of them like speedbumps in the middle of a really awesome racetrack. Like, you can't deny the rest of the racetrack how awesome it is, though you sometimes wish you could run it without the speedbumps. (Fingers crossed that some grievances will be removed in the Enhanced Edition) Pros: -After the initial learning curve, you basically get to sit back and relax and explore an amazingly intricate world of well written, well voiced, beautifully animated and beautifully built NPCs and the world they live in. -You get a lot of self-insertion capability, either playing the righteous hero, or scourge of the land.    And now for a fun story with minor spoilers:  So I'm playing Beast On the last legs of his life being beaten up unfairly by 3 condecending copies of Amadia, and 1 of Duna he's shackled he's maimed he's crippled he's floored he's on fire he's an inch from death our team long since abandoned him save for one lovely summoner Fane and his Incarnate ""Waga"" Champion in a true heroic moment tried to send a charge of battering ram to knock them all down but no one got to see what happened after the champion charged all 4 members of our divinty crashed as soon as the spell was cast 11/10, would get rekt again  "
273,Avigoat,9,15,1,2018-08-05,Recommended,85.9,I would compare this game to the show death note where the first half is absolutley amazing but the second half is lackluster. The first half of the game in driftwood there are so many quests and things to do each quest just as interesting as the last with an immersive city that feels like its lived in but then in the second half when your're on the 3rd island idk what happened  it lost its magic with an island where all you do is pray infront of stones and there are no other quests than the one main storyline. When you reach arx after that very dissapointing island it gets a bit better there are some quests to do other than the main story and they are interesting as well. The combat through the entire game is great. Good progression to feel like your character is truly ready to become divine and if you play this game with a friend it is a great experience that for me kept me wanting to play this game till the end. This game is definitly worth the first 40 hours to immerse yourself in the world however the 3rd and 4th island of the game falls short to the rest.

123,The 4th Survivor,107,91,7,2018-08-07,Not Recommended,70.4,"I really wanted to like DOS2 considering it boasts a DM mode, custom community content, nice graphics, interesting plot, and DnD-like gameplay, however one thing completely ruined it for me after having already played DOS1EE, that one thing is the way combat is handled with the ""armor"" system.  Everything was shaping up to be objectively better compared to the experience I had with Divinity: Original Sin 1 Enhanced Edition before I even played Divinity: Original Sin 2. After playing it though the ""Armor"" system quickly ruined the gameplay and pigeon-holed me(and my buddy) into only a few styles of play. The  ""Armor"" system is basically a health bar for your physical and magical armor that prevents Crowd Control effects till its broken and has to be replenished the same way health is, sounds pretty interesting and good on paper right?? However, in practice this means that crowd control is impossible to use until enough physical or magical damage is given to the enemy you want to use an ability on in question which becomes a problem for people who wanted to build a tanky character or multiclassed character who will be unable to do enough damage to ever be useful when compared to DOS1EE.  The best example I can give to compare the versatility of building a character in the first game is when I played with my friend he went full on support(basically reverse engineered a bard class) mixing a bunch of different magical schools and he was always able to contribute to our mutual success even without using damaging spells(which he could still use but he decided to specialize more in healing/haste/dmg buffs&accuracy buffs etc) contrast that with my character who was built towards maximizing health and resistances whilst also using 2 handers, basically a tank who didn't use shields. We were both successful and had a lot of fun with it even though neither of us were focusing on damage. When we played DOS2 we very quickly realized that mixing and matching even 2 different focuses was hampering our ability to deal with any given situation as we couldn't do enough damage to use 90% of our abilities effectively thanks to the armor system.  My final gripe is that lone wolf was broken compared to DOS1EE. In DOS1EE if your friend decided to choose lone wolf, they could still have a single companion with then, and you were the one who couldn't use a companion. Makes sense and doesn't ???? over your buddy because of your decisions right? Well in DOS2 if one of you takes it then you both might as well because if even one extra companion is in your party you lose the effects of lone wolf for whatever reason. Additionally just because you picked up lone wolf in DOS1EE didn't mean you were stronger than a party of 4, it was more an option for people that didn't want to manage more characters and preferred a different style of play. Not the case in DOS2 as we quickly found out that the most viable option in the entire game is 2 lone wolves going for a pure damage build, every other option is so much worse that you cannot really expect to have fun trying out anything that isn't pure damage and it is all thanks to how the ""Armor"" system was implemented combined with the changes to lone wolf making it overpowered instead of just different.  I never really expected to be so put off by the sequel when I had so much fun with the first game. In DOS1EE both of our characters were unique and well thought out and in the DOS2 our characters became thinly armored artillery cannons and battering rams out of necessity rather than ingenuity and that is why I am disappointed in DOS2. I really wanted to not only like it but love it but me and my buddy got bored and couldn't even finish our campaign compared to when we played DOS1EE we couldn't put the game down day after day until it was over.  Maybe Definitive Edition will solve these issues but I remain doubtful based on how the armor system was implemented, it's very existence will be practically sewn into the game at this point and even a second comb over from the devs will likely keep it very much the same."

I LOVE THE FIRST GAME AND I LOVE THIS GAMES WORLD. but honestly this game just feels like its punishing you for playing it. unless you want to take in every detail and take 10 minues deciding every move the first game is much much better. easy is like dumb as hell. and classic is a grulling struggle to stay alive. honestly yuou hit level 10 and the game just stops being fun. basically play a team that does one dmg type either physical or magical or struggle almost every big fight.  as a big fan of this game, i find it super annoying to se such an amazing expirence lose its self trying to be this hard game. if you can make an actually hard game do it, but making a game with bloated enemy stats late game and encounters literally designed to kill you until you figure out the ""gimmick"" (i dont use that word lightly) to win. this results in a rinse and repeat strats that kill any immersion the steller setting this game gives you. for a game that lets you do anything in many senerios, the fact that leveling kills your exploration, and guides you through thte game in a basically linear path is pretty sad and goes to show the developers had ""this need to be hard because ppl like the hard stuff"" in mind which goes so against how the rest of the game feels.  like i play games when im high and trying to relax, i like a challange, not getting but ????ed for making the wrong action selection because i didnt pay attention to the five minutes it was the enemies turn....... for anyone whos played  it the oil to fire voidling fight is  a  good example of my point. unless you know whats going to happen in that fight you will die even on easy mod.  thats not fun, thats lame game design."

On the recommendation that the narrative and thematic elements had been improved while maintaining the original's strong combat mechanics I decided to give the sequel a go.  At about 50 hours invested, it's awful and surprisingly dull:  ~Mediocre and generic storytelling (admittedly better than most games but certainly nothing to get excited over).  ~Combat encounters all feel the same (i.e. jarringly arbitrary and ridiculous ...that everything reduces to fire and teleporting regardless of enemy type is only slight hyperbole).  ~The new armor "

216,Terrainosaur,26,34,11,2018-08-19,Not Recommended,138.8,"If DOS2 was a tabletop RPG, it would be the worst Game Master ever.  STAGED TRAPS Every battle is a trick. A lone person can call reinforcements from off-map who run right up next to you while you're stuck there unable to react. THEN combat starts. Ambushes are the most common fight. Sometimes the enemies aren't even there. They appear out of thin air to shoot you. Some situations are scripted, killing your whole party. You either get around them with exploits or avoid them. It's amazing how enemies always go first and have tons of action points, but if you try to ambush one of their sentries, their friends detect it from ANY distance and come running. You struggle to improve your basic gear and spells while monsters blast you with spells that are hard to find or create. Every enemy seems to be able to make opportunity attacks, but you have to spend points to get that.  STRAY CLICK? RELOAD! Undetectable traps kill your party. One was underneath a crate I accidentally picked up. I heard 'Look out it's a trap' at the same instant as the explosion. I wasn't even trying to move the barrel, I was trying to open it. If you accidentally click an item in town, the nearby NPCs immediately get a worse attitude to you. Sometimes they attack you, from just a stray click. This is a common theme. I cast poison the ground so my undead character could step on it to heal, but I didn't notice that was his last action point, so my click on the poison sent my NEXT character to run and stand in it. Then he was poisoned, the opposite of what I was trying to do.  HEROES NEED NOT APPLY Many NPCs will attack you if you fail your Persuasion check, even when you thought you were on the same side. There are no consequences of playing a serial killer. Nobody walks into a building, sees the bodies, and alerts the town guard. Lots of online advice is 'Turn in the quest, then kill the quest-giver for more experience.' I saved a man's life, then tried to put out the fire on his house with spells. He said I was damaging his house and attacked me. You don't play a noble adventurer or wicked thief, you play a scavenger. You have to enter every abandoned house and mouse over every spoon to see if it's worth taking. There are countless situations you can't do anything about, but they're designed to make you feel bad. Orphaned baby animals, children with incurable diseases, the poor and starving ... while you're spending piles of gold on the next magic dagger. I tried to heal a beggar and got killed for it.  ROLL YOUR EYES AT THE QUESTS Some quests are impossible to start unless you talk to the NPC with the right party member, or you're carrying the right random object, or you choose the right dialogue options. And you get one chance. There are lots of bugged quests, and quests you can't complete for arbitrary reasons. Countless objects seem useful but aren't, but you have to be extra careful not to sell things that later turn out to be quest items. The lore is garbage. So many books you find are random scribblings that have nothing to do with the story. Look at the title, it's a clue. 'Divinity Original Sin 2' doesn't tell you anything. The game encourages you to use exploits. It encourages you to break it not with tactics but with tricks like 'Teleport your whole party into a prison cell, then teleport the guards in, killing them one at a time. The guards don't have the key to the door! #lolsocool'.  AN EXPERIENCE LIKE CHEWING GRAVEL Expect to spend hours managing your inventory. No, you can't label bags to easily find your herbs. The load times are long, and I'm running it on a new gaming PC. The number of ridiculous, annoying tricks means you'll need to save and reload often. There's no way to speed up the animations. When the enemy summons skeletons which then summon more skeletons, you sit there for MINUTES before you get to act.  In short, Divinity Original Sin 2 is boring and annoying. There's so little PLAYING in this game. It's a non-stop joyless deathtrap designed to make you feel bad - while spending hours saving and reloading. I think the designers actively hate their own customers."

The fact that a big warrior wearing plate armor can start casting fireballs at you completely turns me off. The fact that you can do it yourself is even worse. Also I strongly dislike the physical/magic armor system. It really just seems like the devs got mad that people were stunning everything in Divinity Original Sin 1 with Aerothurge and Hydrosophist but didn't have enough finesse to come up with a better way to stop it.  I am not a fan anymore, I had problems with Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition but still managed to play through it. With this one I'd estimate I'm not even halfway done and after taking a  long time to cool down I still have no drive to slog through the rest of it."

I absolutely adore Larian Studios, which is a huge compliment as I am not much a lover of brands or companies. Larian Studios always knocks it out of the park.   Divinity: Original Sin 2 is competing very closely with my all-time favorite game, Divinity 2: Ego Draconis/Flames of Vengeance. There are so many avenues for replayability, discovery, and enjoyment in DOS2.   I love and treasure all the interactions, the story, the combat, everything. This is one of the most perfect games ever made to me. I highly suggest waiting for the anticipated Definitive Edition which will be coming out soon."
335,Reias,255,3,0,2018-08-26,Not Recommended,133.3,"Backed this game on Kickstarter  Finally beat the game. Played with 3 of my friends, from the beginning, restarted a litany of times in order to play as different characters, and finally beat it today. And wow, was it a bad journey.  Don't get me wrong; The multiplayer aspect was fun. Working with my friends tactically to take down enemies and out manuveur them was insane, but the joy was constantly sucked out by the many choices you could make to ""break"" this game. The freedom of choice is phenomenal and will draw plenty to it, but compared to other CRPGs of the time, the story was broken (quite literally at times, with our group not even finishing Sebille or Fanes backstories; My own, playing the Red Prince, seemed to get stuck at the end though it seemed to be finished), the action was often split and far between long sections of players do whatever they want and exploring, and there was a fair amount of time where I didn't experience the story at all because other players went left when I decided to go right.  Now most of what I mentioned as problems were intended to be features of the game. Carve your own path in a multiplayer in which everyone can participate on different sides of the same story; Do what you want when you want, and solve problems in unique ways. This prospect was the same thing that I loved playing Divinity OS 1 with my brother a while back. And you can find aspects of this game that mirror those exact design goals. But Divinity OS 1 handled this with a voting system that at least made sense, and the chaos of four players with different mind sets often doing what they want, that you could miss out if everyone isn't tied to each other as they advance forward, and the fact you could completely end another person's gaming experience by doing what you want in a quest and ruin what they intended to do ruined this game for me.  This entire review could be taken as the a twisted view on the positives of what this game has to offer, but honestly, I have a hard time imagining a group of friends / gamers playing the game without ruining it by devolving it into a race to see who gets to experience the game first.  If you are looking for a fun tactical romp through the Divinity universe, look no further. If you are looking for a unique multiplayer RPG that takes your choices into consideration and provides a wonderfully in depth RPG system, get ready to fight your friends and watch what little your teamwork means in a game that forces you to fight against each other to decide the end."

198,Kad,9,29,0,2018-08-30,Recommended,66.4,"Originally I wasn't going to review this game on this account because I have few hours on this account. However, reading through some of the reviews out there, I wanted to speak my piece.  This game changes things from the previous game in the series. And some argue that it makes the game harder, forcing you to play as a certain type of character. However, I feel the need to point out that you are only forced into playing a certain way if you desire to be the absolute best possible character in the game. People say that mixed damage parties are not viable because of the armor system in the game. (If you are unaware, every character in the game has an amount of Physical Armor and Magical Armor. These armors prevent damage and certain effects until they are depleted.) However, me and a friend did a playthrough of this game, and we played as a mixed damage party. For those who are interested, we had: a Summoner who also had abilities in Aerothurge, Pyrokinetic and Geomancer. That was my main. a Ranger who focused on long range physical damage, but also dabbled in Pyrokinetic. That was my secondary character. a Rogue who focused almost entirely on Physical damage. That was my friend's main. a Cleric who used Hydrosophist and Warfare, and acted as our team's tank. That was my friends secondary character. The point of that is to show that we had a diverse build to our team. Sure, it may not have been the most effective. But do you know what it was? Fun. We had a lot of fun playing that party. So, before you get this game, ask yourself this. Do I want to be able to create a character who is unique to my playstyle, even if they are not necessarily the best? If you say yes, then you will enjoy this game. There are so many options for what you can do. However, if you want to build the best possible character, then unfortunately, you will likely be disappointed with how you will need to build a certain way. However, is that not what something being the best mean? If one object is better than all other objects of the same type, does that not mean that in that catagory, there is no other choice besides that one object? It is the same for looking at the builds in Divinity: Original Sin 2. Yes, one is better than all the other. However, if you only play to have the best build, then I think you are missing the entire point of the game. This game is meant to be a medium for telling a story, for sharing memories. While you can play the game alone, it is my belief that for the true experience of the game, you should play it with friends. And when you do, feel free to play however you desire. I will lead to some good laughs when you look back at it."

Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a very refined rpg with a decent 30-ish hours of content without taking into account the amazing replayability (Thanks to the origin character having varying stories and the game having a branching scenario.)  The combat system is close to perfect, the bossfights can be very challenging, the voice acting is great, everything is very pretty and each mechanic is really interesting and in-depth.   The only way I can describe how great this game is is not by stating the endless list of things it does perfectly, but by listing the only few things it could do better: -A few glitches getting you stuck in dialogues when playing coop -Half of the ending cutscene not playing for players who choosed to fight for Divinity and lost -Easy to overlevel and trivialize the game until the last few bosses  And trust me I had to dig deep into my brain to find you that handful of flaws because this game is truly close to perfect.

I prefer real time RPG Combat found in games like Skryim, Fallout, and Witcher 3 (The GOAT).   With that being said, even with it not being my favorite combat method, this game is INCREDIBLE. The story and choice making you can make is very similar to Fallout : New Vegas, where each dialogue matters and has an impact.   In terms of replayability, you can choose across multiple ""Origin"" characters, who all have deep back stories and the ability for you to influence the future on a very large scheme.   If you like RPGs where you get to make choices, this ranks up in the top 3 for me, which are Fallout : New Vegas, Witcher 3, and Divinity : Original Sin 2.

The environmental hazard is out of control and Act 4 seemed like it was done by Larians B team.  Everything is on fire.  Everything is poisoned.  Everything is frozen.  Everything is steamy.  Having the environment react to elemental spells and abilities is a cool idea but if they cut the sheer amount of this by half it would still be too much.  Battlefields ultimately become a ridiculous game of elemental hopscotch.  It's hard to tell what's going on half the time through the smoke and steam.  It's comical after awhile.  The armour, weapons and level scaling is a self-inflicted wound for Larian.  The hours I spent going over merchant wares to find better weapons because mine had become obsolete after a few levels must have accounted for a quarter of my play time.  These topics have been done to death so I'll leave them alone suffice to say you don't have to reinvent every wheel you come across.  It doesn't make sense, it didn't work and sadly bogs down a good story, interesting characters and nice graphics.  It's a popular game and many happily overlook its faults so I'm happy for them.  I simply prefer effort being put into reasonable mechanics over trying to be unique at any cost."
416,themikeyoulike,4,8,1,2018-09-03,Not Recommended,171.1,"Perhaps individuals are polarized when it comes to this game. I've now invested enough time in the game to get to level 14. I have to say it hasn't been an enjoyable experience. In fact it's been masochistic. It's almost as though the developers wanted to punish the gamer for playing this style of game.    It's been a laborious grind to achieve levels, forcing one to kill all types of NPCs to gain levels simply to take on the progressively demanding elements of the game. The parsimonious way in which leveling opportunities are availed to players is frustrating. Creatures or challenges do not re-spawn and paired with the weak continuity of the game narrative, a player is forced to roam haphazardly throughout the world in search of clues. Essentially an exercise in wasting time.   Not a game I recommend if you like fluid continuity in the gaming experience. A good example of a game that flows is Grimm Dawn.   Furthermore, the camera angles are terrible. It's almost as though the developers got lazy and didn't wan't to render a horizontal third-person perspective. I've honestly never seen a game where such a perspective isn't included. And I think it's a poor way of increasing the difficulty level of a game.  One could argue that eliminating a mouse, keyboard or decreasing the viewable space of  world could increase difficulty but that is truly low hanging fruit.   I truly don't see what the vast appeal of the game is. And because there are no trial versions of the game You'll have to risk playing the game before you'll know if it's for you.   Good luck."

I am not usually a big fan of turn based combat and that might give people cause to pause when considering this game, it did with me anyway .... dont let that stop you though.   This is a true role playing game something we see so very rarely these days, the turn based mechanic of the combat wont get in your way. In my experance any way the game's turn based mechancis wont adversly impact your enjoyment in any way, if anything you may find you like it if only in this specific case. As to the story, world and characters they are all master strokes through and through, the massive array of options and granular details to game give it huge replayability just in terms of the main campaign and the community have added a lot more via mods and scenarios. Put simply you will get your monies worth out of this game just from the stock content then on top of that you have a great community giving you even more via Workshop and Nexus.  Cons? Nothing really, while the game isn't perfect ... simply because nothing is ... there is nothing I would see changed about it that isn't a matter of personal taste and for thouse aspects of taste the community has that covered in mods e.g. difficulty rebalance, spell effects, rate of progression, etc."

Downside is sort of strange fiction where clerics heal by sucking blood off the ground? Very detailed but still odd to me. Fun game.  I'm having an issue where I get jumped by badguys near the edge of town. I run into town and stand next to a town guard.  I stay in combat because exiting teleports you like fast travel. He is still out there watching me get beaten down in front of him while never ever attacking the guy burning EVERYTHING. (the fire does nothing to the guards and townsfolk not in combat yet hugging)  So there is that. Still a good game.  This is quickly turning into a feces title.  In sneak as a barrel tucked in a corner behind a tent BUT the guard detect vision goes through that type of object.   So much saving and loading because of lack of polish.  For instance just now; a fading mine that cloaks when your near.  -I saw it and manuver my man to a point where straight line in a safe corridor was the direct path. -I click the destination and my digidal dynamo heads off straight as an arrow like planned, only to vear 45* left straight into the mine blowing it and dodging a terrifying patch of THIN AIR!

67,Cryswar,218,30,4,2018-09-05,Not Recommended,61.4,"Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle; despite the countless options the game wows you with even from fairly early on, the horrific game design makes a great many of approaches unplayable or pretty underwhelming.  The EXTREME overuse of enemy immunities is a big one - good luck trying to play a synergistic earth/fire caster when huge swathes of enemies are completely immune to most or all of what you can do with little to no warning - but don't worry, you can reload and respec and completely change your build to deal with them!  Hope you didn't bother bringing mixed physical and magical damage - enemies essentially have separate health bars for each type - making it ideal to bring pure magic OR physical damage (and in almost all cases it's vastly superior to just bring overwhelming physical damage). Don't worry, maybe you can have a buffbot caster - or just reload and respec for free with no downsides.  Hope you didn't want to roleplay each character having different social strengths and out of combat abilities - you never know when you're going to get dragged into an unskippable and unavoidable conversation that requires you to have high social stats to navigate successfully - but don't worry, you can just reload and respec to a social god, go and do it, and then respec back into being a thief or whatever!  While I am always in favor of respecs, making it completely free and without any downsides, at any point in the game, in a game that HEAVILY rewards specialization and defined roles, really rips apart any veneer of real player choice. It's not about going through a world, it just turns into a puzzle of deciding when to respec to automatically win one challenge and then respec again to beat the next.  There's also a wonderful modding community with a wide variety of intriguing mods to make the game harder/easier, add new classes, fix problems in the base game, add more monsters, and basically everything else to tailor your experience to be exactly as punishing or trivial as you want - but fortunately Larian knows best and ensured that a single mod disables all achievements because how dare those filthy modders try to alter their game!  The character interactions vary from hilariously terrible to genuinely interesting and were among the brightest points in the game; there is some excellent writing that does a lot to help you get into the head of each character (vengeance-driven elvish assassin, snarky egotistical undead, hardcore grizzled mercenary, etc) while allowing you to twist those personalities in ways that fit the character but align with your vision of them; the Elf is never going to be a chill person but you can turn her into a relentless hate-fueled machine of death who slaughters anyone who ever wronged her, a laser focused woman only concerned about the few people who truly deserve her vengeance and doesn't hurt others unnecessarily, or anything in between.  I especially enjoyed how each player character in coop can react to things differently and further their own storyline, but if you don't discuss it with your coop partner it can get pretty awkward at times, especially if they just happened to trigger a major plot event that you have no say in until after they aggro'd everything on the map. Or if you accidentally trigger a cutscene that you simply don't have the social or perk-based tools to handle appropriately. Or if one of you accidentally misclicks and aggros half the city.  The recent Definitive Edition update professes to make the execrable plot slightly better and 'rebalances' the game - by nerfing power combos into the ground and giving tiny buffs to skills that were comically bad before and are generally still comically bad now. Doesn't deal with any major design flaws, unfortunately, just dunks on SOME of the best combos while ignoring others and not actually giving a damn about underwhelming options.  This game definitely has heart and while I am forced to give it a thumbs down based on steam's binary system, in reality I would probably give it closer to a 5 or 6 out of 10. maybe as high as 7 if you're willing to overlook some of its flaws. It's not a TERRIBLE game by any means. But it's no Baldur's Gate or anything close - a lot of glossy paint over a rotting veneer, with a major subsection of the community among the more toxic and elitist individuals I've met in my time of online gaming and forum discussion. DoS2 is enough of an improvement over DoS1's horrific missteps that it gives me a little hope that DoS3 might actually be a genuinely good game, but the tripe of this Definitive Edition doesn't do a lot to give hope."

What i hoped to find was a ""fast"" phased turn based combat rpg with thrilling story, but instead I got this (which I found out rather late, if you are like me and wants to use alot of time on creating your potaganist):  The controls are clunky and slow.  The camera controls are rubbish. No dynamic movement at all, and let me say, you use alot of time moving it around to see your character instead of tree tops and??????. (there is not transparant view for some reason?!)  The combat is slow (another turnbased game with slow movements.. just why?)   The story was okay, but it seems rather off, which I can not quiet put a finger on. Just feels odd which is why I have not progressed very much.  I might have enjoyed the game alot more if not for the biggest negative: the static camera... I mean.. ffs it is 2018 already!"
115,Daemone Isos,181,39,33,2018-09-06,Not Recommended,516.1,"I wanted to like this, but I did not.  I respect the enthusiasm of the people who enjoy it, but I have to admit that I was disappointed.  There were two related major design decisions that combined to take the fun out of the game for me.    The first was the general fussiness of many of the quests.  They were very particular in how they could be progressed, and that frequently led to either failure to continue, or a great deal of (unenjoyable) trial and error, or alt-tabbing to the wiki.  Each of these outcomes spoiled the immersion and momentum of the roleplaying.  The related design decision was the general absense of clear direction.  I truly respect this idea, but it poses high hurdles for implementation.  Combined with the general freedom to explore, it led me to random places on the map, with a nice open-world feel.  The problem was that I stumbled into heavily scripted quest areas which could not progress due to the first issue above.  For example, I fight a tough group of guardians, and suddenly nothing happens.  Apparently, those guardians are for some later part of the main quest, but the game gives me no clue or context about what is going on.  The quest logs sometimes make notes reminding me of people I have met and things I have seen, but no clues to follow.  So appearing to be dead-ended someplace interesting, I fall back on the wiki, to find out that this is the scene of a major scripted encounter that I have not yet triggered.  It feels deflating.  No, I don't want to use the wiki (aka spoiler bucket).  But arriving at a grand stage before the production starts is a drag.  It feels pointless.  And honestly, backtracking to some other (undefined) location to get back on the path that the quest doesn't point me to seems far too random.  To be explicit, wandering should yield encounters, not prevent them.  This process was confusing in Act I, frustrating in Act 2, and terminal in Act 3.  I wish the best to the development team, but I can't get excited to finish the game."
428,Lockebone,43,6,2,2018-09-06,Not Recommended,5.1,"only spoilers are for the first couple hours.  Its definately just me but this game is not as good as everybody says it is.   The story is rather dull, and almost breaks the 4th wall multiple times in the very beginning hours. I see how little hours ive played but that doesnt count the time I have also spent playing on the console versions of both games.   Besides that. The story is plain, dull, and possibly gets better the deeper you go. But with 10 other games I want to play that have come out, do I have time to care about a game that can not set its hook in me after the first 10 hours or so of gameplay.   Having played and beaten tons of games of this genre. Let me explain why I feel this way.   1. The 4th wall almost being broken really perturbs me. Maybe I am interpreting things wrong.   2. The dialogue is veryyy boring, pretentious, makes fun of gaming and ADND type playing. Another thing other people don't see but I felt that way. Mostly when dealing with the NPC's and the reactions and way they are represented.   3. The interactions between charactors. So I am a source connected (potential terrorist) to the people in control, I am captured and sent on a ship to prison, basically a genocide camp. At this camp, the people are allowed to just wonder around, with that, they are allowed weapons, flasks of poison and fire are ALL OVER THE PLACE. Really? Wtf kind of government allows its feared people that it has already illegally arrested to wonder around with weapons.   4. For example. A magistar is killed right after you get to the island, I think partially to give you story info with eating her body parts as an elf or something, also to illustrate the pure cruelty of the magistars. Forcing one of there own kind to publically cut out her own tongue and then just blast her and kill her.  But me a source connected guy who OPENLY disobeys everything she says is allowed to just walk away, with a group of weapon wielding adventures on my heels.   I am sorry. I understand why everybody likes the game. It can be a lot of fun. But also. its not a 9/10, objectively its well crafted, with difficult controls even on a PC, excellent graphics, that show you details of items and people that have probably never before been seen or done in this genre of gaming.   But I cannot get over what I would call poor effort into the Sociology and Psychology actions of the environment and people living in it.   Weapons, flasks, potions and all those things should not just be lying around all over the place. Prisoners are never allowed to roam free, empowered mythical beings with magic powers and weapons of great power would NEVER allow insubordination such as I provoke go unpunished. The controls are tight but also complicated, detail orientated, and not for people who have trouble seeing small objects. As you can indeed zoom in, try playing an rpg like this zoomed in.   All in all, its a love story to classic games of the same genre, with twists put on the traditional gaming tropes related to fantasy games that seem to be put there merely to throw the trope away.   Such as the lizard folk being the intelligent ones and the elves being wild humanoids that devour body parts. Completely reversing how this traditionaly would go.   I guess my overall point here is this, like mass effect, the choices you make and things you do, to me almost seem pointless as the story will push forward no matter what, its overly complicated JUST TO BE COMPLICATED, which makes the mechanics not fun but more of a chore required to be used to play the game (my past 30 years of ADND and RPG gaming experience should be enough).   Not downplaying the amazing work done here for the genre and the fact that many if not everybody will probably have a good time with this game.   But ehhh. It could have been better. Stop riding the bandwagon so hard and really ask yourselves. Objectively.   Is this as good as everybody says it is?"

There is a new version of this game call Definitive Edition was released while I was still working my way through the Classic version.  The two versions arent compatible and I can't comment on the new version.  Divinity is a somewhat open world 3d isometric turn-based RPG. Think sort of Dungeons and Dragons with a different system. You create a character with certain classes and attributes and off you go!  The game gets a lot of things right.  A relatively decent story, great characters, fantastic voice acting, and lots of places to explore. There is so much charm to this game and so many things that I want to like...  However, all of this is really overshadowed by some other terrible things.  The first is that you never really know where to go. You spend considerable time simply bumbling around the world. The way the world is set up if you go into the wrong areas at the wrong time you will get absolutely beat down without mercy. Theres no way really to tell if you can do a mission except to the area and see the level of the enemies and if they are too high you know you are in the wrong place. There are also some areas where you have no idea where to go and just wander around aimlessly. This kind of stuff I call wasting the players time.   No wonder Ive seen people say it takes 100 hours to complete a play-through, you spend a considerable chunk of it lost! The older I get the less tolerance I have for this kind of mechanic.  I just want to get through the game in a reasonable amount of time, and the game is already pretty long.  The second is the fact the game is so dang hard. I played on normal and I never rage quite a game as many times as I did this game. The disparage between your party and a group of enemies on +1 levels or even levels is astonishing.

304,c_bus87,17,6,1,2018-09-10,Not Recommended,57,"I might be one of the few who genuinely does not like this game. Here's why:  1) I feel like there are 'gotcha' moments in dialogue. Someone asks a question and you are given a few responses. One of them progresses the quest, the other two end it because the person gets mad at you or something. There is no way of knowing which one is correct (by investigation, getting to know the person, etc.) or by coming back later. I can hear the devs going ""Haha you picked the wrong answer!!!"" Not clever, just irritatig.   ""Hey, do you like a, b, or c?""  ""I like a.""  ""You idiot! Now I don't like you forever!!"" -- a regular conversation, apparently.  2) An over-reliance on terrain types in combat. Terrain types should be an accent to a strong combat system, but this feels like boring fighting on changing terrains. It makes combat feel like a weird board game a opposed to a real tactical experience. I would rather see an emphasis on flanking, cover, team work, and skills. There are many battles that simply cannot be won without manipulating terrain type.  3) The game lacks immersion. I'm not sure I ever cared about the quest or main mission. The world doesn't feel lived in. There are to many jokes that rip you from the seriousness of the situation. The tone is chicken jokes, not end of the world or serious danger. Additionally, once an area is clear its clear for good.  If I remove a gang in the prison, is it likely that no one will fill the power vacuum? No more prisoners will come in? The world feels empty and unresponsive.  4) Growth happens slowly at first, but then very rapidly. I don't feel like I've earned a lot of my attribute points. The way areas are leveled also makes the game feel very linear, and, again, once an area is clear it's typically clear for good. No random encounters, which might make leveling up to face a tough enemy more rewarding.  "

804,Jim0bhab,19,2,4,2018-09-10,Not Recommended,27.3,"Possibly the single worst experience I've ever had playing a video game.  The story is bland, uninspired, and borderline incoherent. The player is expected to have background knowledge of the game's premise prior to actually starting the story. In trying to learn what the hell was going on, I actually had to pull out my phone to consult various ""fandom"" websites to even get a hint as to what the story might actually be. Didn't even try to figure out some of the more miniscule details of the plot, less I get an aneurysm.  The writing is awkward, amateurish at best and comes off as stilted/pretentious. Dialouge choices have almost always the same outcome. The most crucial decision making often results in what can be described as a ""yes/no"" response. Even bothering to waste your time conversing with characters seems to be a blatant waste of time in the long run.  Character modeling and development is laughable. Characters often end up unimportant mary-sues with the same face and clothing. Those who aren't reused assets try way too hard to be unique, resulting in characters so aggravating that they're better left off dead than alive. I've seen better character creation options in Final Fantasy I. Final Fantasy I characters are also more expressive, even though they're pixelated.  The voice acting is masterful. That being said, it seems the entiriety of the game is voiced by about four people. Even characters physically next to each other often have the same voice actors. The narrator of the game helps to destroy any immersion and often serves as an effective deterrent against players, who might conscientiously decide not to do certain things lest they trigger this bastard's voice lines.  The gameplay is standard at best. Turn-based combat that while polished, brings absolutley nothing new or imaginative to the table. Generic armor, combat, and magic scaling that encourages anything but a ""diverse"" playstyle. The combat has about as much ""depth"" as some old school NES games did. Difficulty is widely adjustable. Inventory management is simple and uncomplicated. Crafting system might as well not exist. Attempting to play multiplayer results in a kick from a disgruntled host.  The game has little to no bugs. The game will occasionally crash at startup, but this is a minor setback that can be overcome by restarting the client. The game's collision detection and geometry is top-notch. Physics, particles, and graphics overall are pretty. Game is well-optimized. Color pallettes are appropriate and are able to adequatley set the mood for various landscapes. The landscapes of the game although, are about as uninspired as the game's characters, dialouge, combat and story.  The developers are unable to take criticism, going so far as to harass people on message boards for simply not liking their game. The developers do release new patches and content over time however, most of what is currently being added and fixed arguably should've been implemented in the game when it debuted. Error reporting is present and comes off as unintrusive.  The game is compatible with steam workshop mods, which is a big plus in my book.  Overall I could not reccommend this game to anyone and I feel as though the game shouldn't even be considered for play, even if it was free.

I have no idea what the different classes mean, what kind of classes my companions should be, and combat is generally too hard. So all in all the game is not fun. A shame, I wanted to like it. "
753,Sammy Spudgun,364,4,5,2018-09-13,Not Recommended,52.7,"Step 1: Get into fight. Step 2: Lose fight after 5 minutes. Step 3: Use savescumming to put your units in optimal position for the fight. Step 4: Lose fight after 13 minutes. Step 5: Realise you didn't save before your previous attempt, which had really good positioning. Step 6: Win fight after an hour total. Step 7: Get into a fight with the next group of enemies.  I gave this heap of smeg multiple attempts. Eventually I gave up out of frustration and boredom after reloading a single fight 8 times in Act 2.  Recently, I tried the Definitive Edition with two friends, and it started off well; We were all having a good time. However, as soon as we stopped fooling around - murdering every NPC in Fort Joy - and tried to progress, we came up against a fight that killed the fun. A fight that, despite our being level 6 from our rampage, gave us a game over four times, each after an agonizingly long run.  In these runs, I saw every design decision and bit of balance that made me resent the original game left perfectly intact. For instance, the ""decaying"" status effect is horrendously designed. With little visual indication, it's all too easy to accidentally kill yourself while trying to heal, and there are very many enemies that are capable of inflicting it on you. In addition, magic is still comically weak compared to physical damage. Why bother with it when everybody has their own elemental resistances? Even when an enemy has higher physical armour, just wailing on them will invariably kill them faster than trying to whittle down their magical armour.   While I am by no means averse to difficult games, this game's difficulty mixes with it's slow pacing like orange juice and toothpaste.   As for the armour system, I cannot dump hard enough on it. In most games, armour reduces the amount of HP damage you take from certain types of attack. This is fine. In others, armour is instead a seperate bar that has to be emptied before HP damage is dealt. This is also fine. What isn't fine, however, is having two seperate bars for physical defense and magical defense. It only serves to punish you for trying to mix up your strategy. It means that your wizards can't soften up an enemy for the knight, unless you spend a long time emptying both the enemy's physical and magical armour, but why would you take the time to do that? A far more sensible system would be a single armour bar with a sliding scale of whether it takes more damage from magic or from physical attacks. But that's too much like good game design to be in this. Imagine if you were playing DOOM and every enemy had a seperate HP bar for every weapon you have. I can honestly say that the DOS2 armour system is one of the most poorly designed mechanics I have encountered in any game I've played, and I've played some garbage.  It's a poorly balanced and poorly designed slog. You're dissuaded from mixing magical and physical damage by the core mechanics: In order to HP damage, you first off have to empty your target's respective magical armour or physical armour bar. The story is uninteresting, featuring a bland doomsday antagonist. On the bright side, it's impossible to get truly angry at the difficulty because you'll be too bored to be angry!  I sincerely wanted to enjoy this game, but every single time I found myself thinking ""I am not having fun, why am I trying to deny this?"""
929,OR2008,96,2,14,2018-09-13,Not Recommended,172.5,"Don't get this game.  I spent over 100 hours trying to figure out what to do and I never got off the first Island. Everything in this game is veiled in complexity hidden behind layers of convolution. Nothing in this game is straight forward - which isn't a problem - but the game doesn't explain anything. The wiki is just as bad - which tells me the developers were making this game for a specific audience already familiar with their product, or they themselves created a monster and didn't know how to deal with it so they released it unto the world.  Quest logs are organized haphazardly, on-screen notification don't stay on screen long enough, characters are bland at best and downright annoying at worst. You have to walk around with left alt depressed or you won't be able to see anything. Nothing on screen is viewable and so you might miss that key placed right next to the door on that ship...  What was really annoying for me was that there weren't any dedicated traders in game. You have to remember to barter with everyone you meet since they could have something of value and then remember where they are located because you won't have anywhere near the amount of money you need to buy basic survival items. A little tip: don't spend money on weapons - buy tons of armor and spells.  The combat. Jesus Christ, the combat. It's so bad. The player gets to choose from a dozen or so classes, but don't you dare! Don't even think about choosing a non-magic build. Raw physical damage will get you nowhere. Oh yeah, every enemy has at least 2 health bars, sometimes three: Physical health, armor and magic. Mages will have more magic armor than physical, melee characters will have more physical than magical, so you have to attack each accordingly. At level 7, I have to do upward of 200 freaking damage to kill something. What?! That's insanity. The combat is so convoluted and overly complex. Why do I have to create these exaggerated, synergistic combos to get anywhere? I mean, there are 12, TWELVE! different types of surfaces. Are you serious?! TWELVE? GTFOH! I get that understanding this stuff can be rewarding, but it shouldn't take 100 hours to do that. If a developer wants people to play their game, accessibility has to exist somewhere in the game. In this game, it doesn't exist.  The AI. GD AI! Always focuses on one character - the weakest - and they manage to kill them in 3 turns. My DPS is stupid low compared to enemies that are supposed to be the same level. I'm guessing enemies scale in this game since I never fought anything higher leveled. Scrolls are required to resurrect characters, which you'll be needing tons of btw since healing is so scarce. Enemies seem to have tons of AP. I once had an enemy move halfway across the screen, cast a spell and attack on the same turn. Come on. Nothing about this game's combat system makes sense in a traditional risk/reward system. You're penalized heavily for taking risks and penalized heavily for not deviating from hack n slash. This game wants you to play perfectly. Every. Time.   If you do decide to get this game - first have your head examined, then, seriously, sit the F down and map out the kind of character you want. Everything about the character. I mean EVERYTHING. Look at the skills, the attributes and abilities. EVERYTHING!  Or, just don't get this game. That'd be better."

If you got in your group someone who speaks with animals, have good persuasion and wits scores, with only DamageDealers you're sure you'll miss nothing and progress easely : quests are interesting but dont need any analysis or long searchs, no mortal traps anywhere, no oneshots (maybe with Alice or missing in making Hannag one of your friends), no wipes (except being too optimistic with Adrahmalihk), quite nothing to detect, quite nothing to miss anywhere (Braccus legs ?) and finaly a hardest difficulty mode ""too soft"" for most of players.  So... how explain our actual 600hours on DOS2 HM with many diffrent groups and choices (magical, physical, distants, ranges, with  tank, with only DD, 2 lonewolves, wipe maps in genocides, or pacifist ""ust alone"") ? For me the biggest quality of this game isnt RPG at all but by-turn-combat options and strategies, with many different builds choices and mix for each member. Every tactical/HM combat is a +/- complex arena where you must analyze options and ways to success. Concerning GameMastering Leaks are finaly forces : this part of game must be seen as a way to play exactly the way you RPG-play around a table, and not to create a big scripted world like with Aurora (NeverwinterNights).

Pros: +The world of Divinity OS 2 is vast and deep +The characters are fantastic, applies to NPCs but especially the Origin characters +An easy enough to understand combat system that possesses a great amount of depth +Absolutely stunning graphics +From the sound design to the soundtrack and especially the voice acting, its superb +The modding community is impressive to say the least with tons of ways to augment your experience  Cons: -...   More In-depth (Spoiler-Free)   +Story: Lets start this off with one of DOS2s greatest points, the story and world. While of course staying as spoiler free as possible, the game comes with an incredibly vast world for you to explore and venture through as you work towards your ultimate objective (which Ill be withholding for any prospective players interested in the game). From the main quest to the side quests, from your perspective as the protagonist to the NPCs in the games world, Larian has truly given thought to how theyd flesh out every area in terms of its lore. The greatest part of all of this is that, despite being a sequel, there's no disconnect for the player even if you having played the first. While I recommend playing both, I can assure any of you who were hesitant about diving straight into the second, it's completely alright to do so. This point on just how deep the world of DOS2 goes becomes apparent the moment you attempt to create a character and are revealed the Origin characters which I will be focusing on next.   +Origin: What is an origin character? Origin characters are a set of 6 very unique characters that already have their backgrounds integrated into the very core of the game. You can think of them as the closest thing to a preset character when thinking in terms of RPGs, but you neednt fret, they are completely customizable on their stat spread and what class you wish to play as. I especially love these origin characters because they add an entirely new layer to whats going on, youre not only worrying about the current state of the world as the story tells it, but also your own circumstances. For example (very minor spoiler ahead), one of the origin characters is a red lizard with the title of The Red Prince, born for glory yet fell from grace for cavorting with demons, and on his own quest to reclaim his rightful throne. Given his position in the overall world of the game, hes an important figure to say the least, as a result very early on in the game an assassin will make an attempt on your life. That is just a very small insight as to what DOS2 has to offer. These origin characters could each have their own stories told separately, but no, they intertwine into a much bigger tale. The amount of content you get from the narrative of this game alone is astonishing, and for that Larian Studios deserves a round of applause.  +Gameplay: Now, lets get to the real meat of the game, shall we? How does the game play? In a word, spectacular. The game, as a CRPG, gets the job down without many issues. From traversing the various lands to engaging in combat, the game both looks and feels great. As a keyboard and mouse user at the very least I found the controls to be quite intuitive. Combat is fairly simple, you learn skills and associate those skills to your hotkey of preference, activating said skill will either require that you choose a target or a specified location (Area of Effect) which will be controlled by your mouse. Pretty simple, right? However, the battlefield is ever changing and the higher the difficulty, the more considerate you need to be of what exactly is happening and how you should react accordingly. There are many factors that can go into a fight than just slinging spells into the face of your enemy, environmentals and utility based effects can be the key to turning the tide in a battle. This may sound like rather obvious advice, but I cant think of a CRPG thats done it better than how Larian Studios has.  Like in D&D (where you will often hear the comparison made), the game really starts from the beginning of the game, the character creation (yeah, were back to good ol character making) the distribution of your points from the beginning and how you proceed from thereafter is crucial, especially if youre a player that wishes to challenge themselves with the highest difficulty. One particular stat in the game that Id like to bring up in reference to this point is the memory stat. Memory is a stat that you upgrade when you wish to assign more skills to your hotbar."

It probably is the single best isometric rpg for it's first 2 acts and then drops in quality. Hard.  Sadly even the definitive edition did little to fiix this. The combat system of d2 is briliant. The plot is great. the love for detail in the first 2 acts is awesome.  BUT: The 3rd act is an insult to people who played through the first 2. Questlines are not written out, there are uncharacteristic plot twists and very limited room to make any choices. The only logical choice in this act always seems to be ""just kill everybody"" as choices are just that black and white. The last act is again much better however disappoints in the end. Because d2 has no ending. The game just stops. The story is not concluded, your descisions seem to have had little impact in the final ""what happens after..-scene"", character developement seems to not have happened in the epilogue... a very confusing and lackluster climax of what could have been one of the all time greatest.  Voting ""don't recommend"" to even the odds here. In truth the game is very much worth your time, even if only for the first 2 acts. You can drop it after that."

The offending case is being right infront of an enemy, having them be in my range of shooting...having them be well with in my range of shooting, having them be a huge giant bug, being able to drag my mouse all over their body and not being able to shoot at them, but coincidentally enough, not being able to shoot behind them since they are physically blocking my arrow with their body.

438,Serpent King,117,4,5,2018-10-05,Not Recommended,350.8,"I will be honest - I started out loving the game and went straight for the taction difficulty. It was a breeze until Act 2 when I arrived at Reapers Coast. Then it suddenly became impossible; every single enemy was 3-5 levels higher than me, they all had 4 times my shields, 2-3 times my HP, and 2-3 times my DMG not to mention I was always holariously outnumbered...   I decided I must have done something wrong because the game was supposed to be challenging, not impossible so I restarted it. I did some research, read about what people were doing that works well, and made a better line up. This time Act 1 at Fort Joy wasn't just a breeze, it was a joke. I made sure to be very thorrow discovering all the secrets and completing all the quest. I was sure that this time I will arrive at Reapers Coast more prepared and will be able to get around. But no, wrong again. This time I was able to defeat the weakest enemies around from like 10th attemt. The game went something like this: SAVE, DIE, LOAD... REAPEAT!!! This went on for hours until I slowly discovered half the map, talked to a bunch of NPCs, and did the easiest quests. And of course I had to skip about 90% of all combat because most of the time my party was wiped out during the first turn.  Now I find myself stuck. I can not progress any further for this reason or that, mostly because I get wiped out by enemies who are on average 2-3 times stronger than me. And honestly, I find myself out of will to even try. I grew up playing strategies and am not accustomed to being defeated by a computer, especially if I spent hours researching and making sure to do everything by the book and even better. The undeniable truth here is, the difficulty of Divinity 2 is COMPLETELY 100% ARTIFICIAL. Meaning it is not hard because the computer is a better strategist or because I am making any mistakes - it is hard because the developers decided to give the NPCs a completely unfair advantage. Even the enemies of the same level have anywhere between 1.5 to 2 times my shields (4-8 times my magic shields which is absolutely insane), 1.5 to 2 times my HP, 2 times my DMG, and higher initiative meaning they always go first... All I have to say is this - if you are going to make a game and call it strategy, don't be a moron and give one side such a huge advantage. So hey devs, what would you say to a game of chess? A game that I will start with 4 queens and you with 0? Cuz that is pretty much how you made Divinity 2, at least on Tactian Difficulty.  Also, almost all of the ""Boss"" fights are so rigged they are killing any enjoyment of playing the game for me. I am talking about the Hanag fight where she opens a bunch of void portals and my physical DMG party has no way of closing them so the only way through is a 4 vs 20 fight. The Gwydian Rince fight at the blackpits where the only known way to fight against 3 magisters and 20 voidwoken is to abuse a flaw in the game (such as teleporting the idiot into a tent and body blocking his way out and even then he manages to friendly fire my team with his stupid lightning bolts actually causing more DMG to me than the enemy) otherwise he will literally suicide by running through fire for a mile to ????? slap an oil blob. Or the Alice Alicseon fight where she literally 1 hits my entire party on her first move... In the end I defeated all of them but I get no enjoyment whatsoever from having to restart a dozen times every fight until finally abusing a flaw... I have read that a lot of people struggle with these fights even on the easiest difficulty and what do the devs do? Nothing therefore personally I am never purchasing another game made by this studio ever again."

But I can only give a thumbs up and a thumbs down. So with that I guess I can only say that I can only give it based off what the average consumer can expect.  First off this game is linear, in other words, it seems like you can do whatever you want but you actually can't because you need to be a high enough level to do so in the first place forcing you to do quests and tasks in a specific order.  Then there are more issues such as some serious design flaws. The armor system (for example) is one of them. Because of how it works you can't really used a mixed party. You either go all in for physical or all in for magical damage. To make matters worse as long as the enemy has physical armor you can't cc them which is a serious design flaw.  Then it kinda gets a bit worse when we talk about how you have to cheese everything and chain cc to win or how enemies can cc chain you into oblivion. This is why you use a diminishing returns system, ie. the more you use something the less effective it is.  The story is honestly kind of meh but it does have it's ups and downs. Personally I don't have any complaints about it.  Honestly, the game doesn't have that many issues IMO, but the issues are so bad that it seriously tanks the rating that I would give this game from an 8.5-9 out of 10 to around a 7.7-7.8.  With that being said, if you are just some random gamer just looking to pick up and RPG then this game seriously is not for you. This game was aimed at more hardcore RPG fans which is why I have to give this game a thumbs down even if I want to give it a mixed opinion because for the average person this game probably isn't going to be worth it. That's not to say that this is a bad game because it's not bad in the slightest, it's just not good enough for the average person to pick it up and enjoy it.  I suggest that you watch a stream, gameplay review, or a let's play before buying this game because this is not like the first in the series either. So keep that in mind when you decide to buy this game. I  also put the game on the second hardest difficulty and was pretty much being forced to cheese my way through most fights which was very frustrating. It gets kinda better as you get good gear and stats but early on it's extremely difficult so keep that in mind as well if you are new to RPGs that you should not be cranking up the difficulty."

245,Barabus the Grey,175,11,9,2018-10-09,Not Recommended,42.8,"I am not quite sure where to start, as a long time CRPG player from the first Baldurs Gate to planescape torment and ice wind Dale etc, I find myself frustrated and board with this game. Now please note that I really wanted to like these games and I think I have given them a fair shot as i stopped DOS 1 on the 3rd act and this game on the 2nd. Firstly I got interested in this series because of all the Baldurs Gate comparisons and yet this game does not in any way feel similar or even distantly related to those games. The advertising was just complete BS, by trying to lure in the RTWP crowed and I feel a bit betrayed and sucked in. And the developers themselves saying this game is our Baldurs Gate 2 haha, sorry bros but DOS 2 can't even scratch BG2 butt let alone compete with it. In fact I find it kind of insulting that they can even think this piece of meh can even compete with that masterpiece.  Besides all that I did play the first game and I got to the third chapter and gave up due to boredom. In fact I enjoyed the first game a lot more than i did this one, it seemed to have more charm i'm not sure exactly why.  Now I did only get to the start of chapter 2 here so take my review with a grain of salt and understand that this is all based of the first third of the game. So anyways the pros:   I do have to give praise for the amount of voice acting, and having the narrator as well is a welcome and much needed aspect to these types of RPG's, and for the most part it's pretty top notch.   The atmosphere is well done and does a good job of immersing me into the world and enviroments.   I do love the amount of options this game gives you to get through any given situation and how it rewards you for being inquisitive and trying things you normally wouldn't in most games and I think that is admirable, and Kudos to the devs for putting in the effort. More RPG's need this kind of depth in their mechanics.   Cons: I am at odds with the plot of DOS 2 as it is pretty simple, but well told. However it is just not interesting, and I find myself just zoning out when the story parts are playing. Maybe it gets better later I don't really know but judging from the first game I doubt it. The whole game feels overdesigned and not in a good way, the weapons the armor the spell effects are so flashy that it ends up just looking stupid and over the top. So I find that it kills my immersion as usually I prefer more grounded and gritty styles. I will admit that this just a preference thing and is subjective but I just feel that it is flashy for flasy's sake. Again nothing like BG The graphics and art style are nice but most of the environments are bland and not very interesting to look at or explore. Music is hit an miss but mostly not very memorable  The combat is also one of the biggest issues for me. Now I don't normally like turn based combat so again this is subjective, so If you do like turn based combat then you will probably like this. I can tolerate turn based combat if the rest of the game is good enough for me to keep me engaged and I have played other turnbased RPG's and enjoyed them so don't get the wrong impression here, it's just that the combat here feels like filler to turn a 10 hour game into a 100 hour game and to me this is just terrible design over all. Now I love my RPG combat but this is all you will be doing for %95 of the game and it gets old fast. My biggest issue with the combat is that enemies have so much HP and they are just bullet sponges for lack of a better term. so every combat encounter takes for ever and it's just exorsting and not fun, which is a shame because i think this game has one of the best Tun Based systems I have ever played. Also nothing like Baldurs Gates RTWP system. In most RPG's if the characters are good I can forgive a middling story but unfortunatley the characters here are not intersting at all, except for the red prince who I did find intrigueing but it wasn't enough to carry mr through this drudgery. They are reasonably fleshed out with back storyes and personal agendas which is nice but again it just falls flat and they feel devoid of any personallity.    The trading and bartering system is a chore, simple things like this should not take so long and require so much effort just to buy and sell, jesus! Now I get that this game does not hold your hand and I appreciate that but crist a little bit of guidance here and there would be nice and go along way in making this game more enjoyable. Most of the time knowing what to do and where to go is half the frustration I have with DOS 2 and the journal is just walls of text with no helpful information at all. You can easily miss key information about quests during dialogue if you are not payng attention which is easy to do if your constantly zoning out due to bordem like I was, but at least give people an option to turn on decent quest hints to help those who may not care about reading walls of text. And some people don't have a good enough memory to remember small little details that they came across 2 hours ago in amongst 20 pages of dialogue for 10 different quests. Options are alwsys a plus.   Overall this game just feels like a cumbersome, frustrating, monotonous time sink that wants to waste my time, the game has a nice charm and good atmosphere to suck me in but all of it's mechanics and systems just infuriate me and psuh me away which is a damn shame because I really wanted to like this series and I did have enjoyable moments with it but they are just drowned out by all the bad.  Oh and yeah and in case you didn't get it it's nothing like Baldurs Gate.  "

206,devil,131,No,0,2018-10-12,Not Recommended,112.7,"I'm not a fan at the moment, but that's just me. The game is pretty outstanding in most parts, but in the areas I bought it for, it seems to be quite lacking.  The role playing aspect looks pretty impressive. I'm not a big fan of some of that stuff personally, so I think a large part of the game has been lost on me. For example, the protagonist takes on a bit of a rebel/terrorist/survivor role early in the game and shortly after, I land in a new town/area. Someone from the corrupt law & order of the area calls me out! I've been identified! I have 3 options here. One is to surrender but that sounds lame, so I dont like that one. Second is to bribe them, but I want to hold on to my money so I don't like that either. Third is to attack the character who called me out, which I like! :D. But wait, the Entire Town goes hostile on me? Shop keepers to the beggers, everyone wants to kill me now... That quite sucks. From a role playing point of view, that makes sense I guess, but practicaly, this is a Terrible option! Totally lame! How often does an entire town go hostile if you pick the wrong dialog option? Why would they ever even put it there? Why would they put a mine in the middle of a peaceful road that insta-kills half your party? Why is there an area that enemies rediculously more powerful then you, 10 seconds of walking away from where you are supposed to be? Why is this bad guy who's 1 level higher then you able to 1-shot half your group?   Yeah, I felt like I had to reload my last quite save A LOT OF TIMES because of some variation of that. There are lots of ways to do things! But I felt a lot of them were a total waste of time.  So If you love role playing stuff, I think the game has a lot going for you.   Personally, I'm a big fan of the combat system and character development in RPGs. I had a lot of fun feeling like I was mastering the combast system in the first game and thought the new game would have the same combat system, or something basically the same but a bit more polished. Nope. Vastly simplified in my opinion and a lot less fun. I'm pretty sure that they wanted to more closely control the options that the player had for developing the plot, so they took a lot of complexity out of the combat system so that a level 10 creature can be beat by a level 10 party with a bit of focus, but no miracle. 1 level over? Pretty darn hard! 2 levels over? Just forget about it. 3 levels over? You're bascially trying to teach Mario how to swim in lava. The designers don't want to stop you from trying, but it's Very clear they don't want you going there. Likely because if you can skip areas, that will screw up your plot progression, which they put a lot of time and effort into.  It's like the game is giving me all these options of stuff I can do, wich is cool! But some of these options are apparently stupid and I shouldn't have picked them because I keep getting gibbed? Not a fan."

406,Asriel~,138,4,2,2018-10-13,Not Recommended,262.5,"(First off, I'd like to say that I'm not a troll, and am merely attempting to provide decent information as to why this game is, as said in the title ""pretty bad"".)  I've played this game for around 150 hours, and during that time I've discovered countless problems. The main one that has caused me to lose faith in this game is it's weak plot armour. Sure, they've implemented the fact that if you kill anyone the game doesn't stop you from progressing, but there are a select few NPCs that are either unkillable or transform into a dragon and fly away (I'm looking at you Dallis). It completely broke the immersion for me, even though I know she's required to further the plot, it just feels rather improvised and that Larian could've found a better way of portraying their immortality rather than a variation of ""Rocks fall, everyone dies"". Hell, I would've even preferred Physical Immunity over this. The second larger problem with the game in my opinion is the combat system in general. I could list off a couple pages worth of issues with said system, but instead am going to give some of the more noticeable ones such as stealth in combat, which for the most part means cooldown reset button, the armour system, which is pretty self-explanatory, and AI's damage output, which for the most part rends the only thing between you and getting stunlocked to shreds. There are like I previously mentioned, quite a number of other less ""cheesy"" issues with the system that I won't cover in fear of making this a full-fledged book. Now that I've finished naming the two main problems with the game in general, I'll get into listing some of the smaller bugs/problems with the game that are less pressing but still somewhat irritating. Frequent crashes on loading a save, doesn't matter if you have mods or not, this will always haunt you. Difficulty system just makes enemies more spongy, including their armour, which makes them almost impossible to kill when trying to solo the game. Teleportation skill in general can be pretty OP especially when used in a form of ""Hit And Run"", allowing you to whittle down the enemies ranks before facing them as a whole. Crafting has little to no use in the game, unless providing boosts to weaponry. Linearity didn't bother me for the first couple playthroughs, but past that point, It can get pretty boring. Quests provide little to no information on where to go or what to do, instead causing you to blindly stumble around, hoping to discover the answer to a question, or key to a door. Thievery gives no difficulty whatsoever, allowing you to take what you please without any chance of being caught. Talent values are incredibly unbalanced, where some give you gamebreaking skill boosts, others do next to nothing. Experience is given in very small quantities when completing quests, meaning in order to keep up with the enemies, you have to kill a decent amount of NPCs, which can be pretty immersion-breaking when attempting to roleplay as somebody besides a mass murderer.  Hope this has helped at least a few people save their money."

This sequel lost everything that made the first so fun and unique. 1. Character decisions no longer affect the character at all. There's very little interaction between the characters period and few to no choices.  2. It's too easy to get into fights you cannot possibly win from the very beginning. The first game was about strategy and you were never forced into a confrontation you couldn't win. You could avoid it or put it off or do any number of things (with one exception). This game forces you into them ALL THE TIME. It's so stacked for the enemies it's ridiculous. Charmed characters can go through and use all your scrolls and anything in your inventory? BS.  3. It is ridiculously hard to find anything useful in the world. No potion bottles, no craft items, no place to cook. Resurrection scrolls are vital (considering how many OP opponents you face from the beginning) but ridiculously scarce. I've been stealing anything of value anywhere I go and I still have barely enough to do anything when I happen to run across useful items being sold.  4. It's almost impossible to figure out what you're supposed to be doing when. Map markers don't update, quests logs aren't even quests with directives.   5. The armor system completely removes the game from the original, more DNDesque combat type. In the original, status effects were based on a combination of %chance to resist (from your character stats) and %chance to succeed (also from stats) and then a random number roll from the difference. It meant needing to be flexible and have more strategy and plans because you couldn't guarantee a status would take effect. Now you have to deal with a disappointing selection of armor for yourself and enemies with 4x as much armor as you and status effects that will always ???? you over.  6. The attribute and skill system was simplified so much it removed any nuance or character balancing. A tank can just stack on constitution and vitality and warfare and do nothing else. Except the combat makes tanks almost pointless anyways because you can only taunt right next to you and the enemies are never even mostly right next to you.   tldr; this is a terrible version of the first game, aka a typical disappointing sequel"

144,buemmschaf,573,9,0,2018-10-16,Not Recommended,82.9,"Good, not great. Full of awesome stuff, but also full of 'howevers'.  Tactical combat full of choices and decisions, with a boatload of skills to combine with each other to get you through. However - battles sometimes start completely without warning, some of them are just unwinnable by design, others seem to expect you to save-scum to get your people into a winnable starting position.  Excellent story full of twists and turns, with excellent character design and writing. However - quests are poorly defined, goals and conditions to complete them sometimes comparable to the worst among point-and-click adventures. Remember the times when you had to scan the screen, clicking each pixel to find the one that's interactable? Now imagine having a huge, open map where you need to find the specific doodad that advances the quest - except you have no idea where it's supposed to be or what it even looks like.  Puzzles - some of them make sense, others are of the 'you got to be kidding me' variant. I stumbled over some solutions just by accident, others i finally caved and checked a wiki for.  I guess that's my main problem - the longer the game goes on, the more i feel myself drawn to consult a wiki to deal with frustration.  Having to consult an external source to enjoy a game is something i see as a failure on the design side - solutions to your game should be findable inside the game, not by consulting a third-party resource.  The game is full of awesome moments and great stories, and it genuinely entices me to explore it more. At the same time it frustrates me to no end with its design choices. It feels like one of the games I loved as a kid - full of character, deeply immersive, but also deeply flawed in a way sure to frustrate. I don't really have the patience for these kinds of flawns any more. I like Divinity II and will definitely finish it. But I can't in good conscience recommend it."
59,Metsakurat,"1,205",38,0,2018-10-17,Recommended,120.7,"A masterpiece It took me around 100 hours to finish the game. The world of Rivellon is both big and alluring. It was a joy to explore every single corner of it. Each battle was challenging, fun, made me use different tactics and I never got tired of fighting. The game balances roleplaying and combat perfectly. In some RPGs the combat is fine but the story and characters are what keep you playing. However in Original Sin 1 I didn't really care for the story while Original Sin 2 kept me interested at all times. It really improves on the lore, roleplaying and combat. It's definitely a good sequel and one of the best games of 2017.  I only have two complaints: Romance had no effect on the ending and the amount of puzzles in the game. It would have taken me A LOT more than 100 hours to finish the game because of the puzzles.  Now don't get me wrong. The puzzles are all interesting and well executed. There are some simple puzzles, moderate and very hard ones. I just don't have too much time to play video games and since there are so many puzzles in the game I had to resort to using Google way more than I'd like to admit. Now the romance and with it some minor spoilers ahead. I decided to romance Lohse. At the end of the game she asked me if I would like to travel the world with her and I can't answer her. All I can do is end the conversation and in the final cutscene the narrator tells me that she spent the rest of her life traveling Rivellon alone.  Just dissapointing.  But what is the game about? What's the story like? You have the ability to use Source - A powerful and outlawed magic. Magic used by the gods themselves. It's what gives them power. The game starts with you being captured by Magisters who hunt and imprison everyone who can use Source. They take you to an isolated prison island. While there you make new friends, discover an unbelievable truth about yourself and make interesting alliances while trying to escape the island. You will meet dragons, witches, paladins, underground fighting arenas, demons, trolls, ghosts and much, much more. You will also uncover conspiracies and astonishing secrets. Will you be the new Divine?  The game itself plays alot like the recent XCOM games. It's basically a turn-based roleplaying game. Not to worry tho. You can still create a custom character and choose their stats, race, gender, and origin story or you can simply choose one of the pre-made characters. There's a wide variety of classes to choose from as well. All your favourate melee, ranged and magic classes are there. It also has Steam Workshop and modders have made some really interesting class mods that are worth checking out. However, if you enable mods you are not able to earn achivements. This, in my humble opinion, is a bit foolish. It's a singleplayer game and I should be allowed to have my fun however I want. The trainers still work and it has no leaderboards in it so I don't really support disabling achivements for mod users. It's a minor complaint but a complaint nonetheless.  The game is well optimised and ran at a solid 60 frames per second at all times. I did experience two crashes during my playthrough but other than that I really didn't notice any other bugs or issues. Visually the game is lovely to look at and the soundtrack is marvelous. Don't go into it expecting remarkable next gen graphics though.  It's a game I most definitely won't forget any time soon. I want a sequel and I want it now! A must play for every roleplaying fan and fans of the turn-based genre should give it a go as well. Well done, Larian Studios, well done. "
602,TheStratovarian,635,1,1,2018-10-17,Not Recommended,68,"This is a lovely and arguably good game (in potential) that unfortunately is plagued by its own demons.  Pro's. A robust voice acted world full of lines, dialogue and interactions. A world full of lore and history, worked out to give it a vibrant alive feeling. A neat and comprehensive way of playing solo, or with people.   Con's Poorly designed encounters that are aimed at basically gear checking you and tactics. The later areas are a horrible mess of design, approach, and just are unenjoyable from a design standpoint.  The devs have actively cut down on their own design choices to limit almost all builds from what they were capable of.  The game has a great slew of potential. It does, but it comes down to if you get off the CC on a fight, or let the AI gets its 2-4 turns to do its gimick on you. And that is sad, that there is no real feeling of power as you go through this game. There is only, ""Is my gear up to snuff? Are my stats right?""  And it isn't helped by the whole way the plot seems to unravel into 'what are they smoking' when you reach the act past driftwood. It's like they just stopped trying to make sense, and through it as a hodgepodge of writers into a singular typewriter.  It just completely takes you out of what you enjoyed in it. And it stinks, but i can't see myself to finish it. Or recomend it. Between crashes, locks, and corruptions. I just wish it was all it claimed to be, and it could have been Divine."

I have played the game where we did well, forgot to save, had to replay doing all the same things and ended up doing terribly. This game feels like an RNG sim with no stratergy applicable. You can face the same thing with the same odds and constantly end up with different results. If I liked real llife gambling, maybe I would like this game.  It's hard to come back to, it's hard to enjoy in the first place, it's hard to get better at.. I just, don't get why this has such high ratings.   Okay enough critisising without any actual evidence to back up my opinions. Here is some in depth critisising.  I don't know about you, but I seem to fall into the same ""do gooder"" attitude when I'm playing RPGs and I've started this game from scratch a few times and every time I've restarted; it's completely different. The battles change dramatically, but the story does not. Like magic I guess. The story changes depending on the way you answer questions sure; but the experience in gameplay, battling and whatever doesn't change. No matter what; the battles will either be in your favour or not. When the battles are not in your favour, they suck; reload and try again because they will change dramatically. it's seriously random and seeing as you can basically control the world by saving and reloading, do it and keep doing it because it's the only way to progress. Otherwise YOU ARE LITERALLY GOING TO START THE GAME OVER THINKING THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT. The hardest battles can be beaten by this method and that's the reason the level scaling is so high. 1 level lower than you're oponent? The odd's are NOT in your favour, 1 level higher? The odds are. The thing is that if you want to challenge yourself and fight a higher level opponent, the only reason you will win is out of luck, not skill. This is not a skill or stratergy based game and by using stratergy I have failed numerous times. For a strategic player, it isn't fun. It's a gamble every time no matter what I do and the cost always feels far too high. Fighting lower level enemies is the only way to progress without having to reload and redo..... (which I have done far too much)  It took me far too long to figure this out so I'm posting this for the people that enjoy a real challenge; not a fake one. Fake challenges suck and aren't fun. Make a challenge that is actually satisfying to overcome and you have a good start to a game, people look forward to the next challenge. This battle system sucks. It sucks because it is so random and so unforginving. Real life isn't like this. In real life, You try harder to beat the things you think are going to be hard and a lot of the time, you do overcome them. And when you don't overcome them, it is completely devistating; SO MAKE IF F****ING DEVISTATING. It makes you want to do better!!!   My thought... I dunno. Take'em or leave them   :)"

The combat, despite surprisingly innovative in the isometric RPG genre, is clunky and repetitive, as the armor system gimps crowd control and pushes you towards a non-mixed party. Besides, it's unbalanced. For players used to the genre, Classic difficulty allows you to steamroll everything, while Tactician's difficulty forces you to both milk the looting and stealing system to it's ultimate maximum, so as to empower yourself as much as you can, and cheapening every battle possible, like engaging people from the UBER IDEAL angle with the UBER IDEAL positioning, which ruins immersion and roleplay. The game perfectly shows how something new or different isnt necessarily something better.  The story, from its part, is entirely monotonous. Its one thing to be an important character, its another to be the Alpha and Omega to extents in which secondary characters and personal stories from absolutely unrelated people either serve only to make you more alpha and omega or are entirely cast aside. The straw on the camels back for me, was, first, *spoilers* the woman who destroys the initial ship being easily killed in a senseless fight and then the seekers on the island being absolutely erased after the end of Chapter 2. Characters and developments are absolutely forgotten and swept aside C the important part, the game never ceases to remind you, is that youre the Divine. ???? everything else.
